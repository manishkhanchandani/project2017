There was no legal effect as to the woman\'s exclamation because there was no binding contract here. A binding contract requires, there to have been an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Here, the boss\' statement that he would pay the woman $500 a month for the rest of her life could be considered a valid offer because it indicated an intent to be bound, had definite and certain terms, and was communicated to the woman.

For the defendant to be found guilty of manslaughter, a proximate cause between the illegal act and the resulting death of the victim must exist. This causation must be more than simple cause-in-fact; it must be somehow foreseeable from the illegal action taken. In this case, the fact the defendant did not possess a valid license was not a causal factor in the death of the child.\r\n\r\n Answer A is incorrect. The common law misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, while permitting the prosecution of involuntary manslaughter for misdemeanor offenses, still requires that there be a proximate cause between the illegal action and death. Answer B is incorrect. While the licensing requirements may be to protect life, criminal liability for manslaughter requires more than simple negligence, but also proximate cause. Finally, answer D is incorrect; manslaughter does not require that the defendant have any criminal intent to commit an offense. Recklessness is sufficient.

Answer B is incorrect because the businessman did not need to appreciate the risk he was creating to be found guilty of manslaughter. In addition, his voluntary intoxication was one of the reasons for his recklessness and will not serve as a defense. Answer C is incorrect because a proper claim of self-defense does not require that the person actually be in danger, but rather that the person reasonably believe he is in danger, even if it is not true.

Common law murder is not a specific intent crime. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied by actions that show a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. In this case, the woman\'s act of firing an automatic weapon in a populated bank demonstrates the reckless indifference necessary to show malice aforethought, and the woman can be convicted of murder. The woman was acting with gross recklessness toward human life and thus with malice aforethought.

The defendant\'s best defense to a charge of second degree murder is that he was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was insane at the time of the killing.  The defendant would qualify as insane under the <i> M\'Naghten </i> rule, because his delusions caused him to believe that his actions were not criminal as he was acting properly in self-defense.  Likewise, under the <i> Durham</i> test, the defendant would qualify for the insanity defense because his crime was a product of his mental defect.  It is unclear if the defendant would qualify as insane under the irresistible impulse test because it is unspecified whether the defendant was unable to control his actions or to conform his conduct to the law.

The lawyer replied that her usual charge was $100 per hour, and estimated that the legal work on behalf of the client would cost about $5,000 at that rate. The client said, \"Okay, let\'s proceed with it,\" and the lawyer timely and successfully completed the work. Because of unexpected title problems, the lawyer reasonably spent 75 hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed the client a bill for $7,500, with a letter itemizing the work performed and time spent. The client responded by a letter expressing his good-faith belief that the lawyer had agreed to a total fee of no more than $5,000. The client enclosed a check in the amount of $5,000 payable to the lawyer and conspicuously marked, \"Payment in full for legal service in connection with the sale of the client\'s building.\" Despite reading the \"Payment in full. . .\" language, the lawyer, without any notation of protest or reservation of rights, endorsed and deposited the check to her bank account. The check was duly paid by the client\'s bank. A few days later, the lawyer unsuccessfully demanded payment from the client of the $2,500 difference between the amount of her bill and the check, and now sues the client for that difference.\r\n\r\nWhat, if anything, can the lawyer recover from the client?', 'Answer B is correct. Under rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked \"payment in full.\" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Although mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord, consideration is furnished where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Even if the client lacked sufficient legal basis to prevail on his claim, his good-faith belief in the validity of the claim makes his promise to settle sufficient consideration to support the modification. Therefore, when the lawyer read the \"payment in full\" language on the client\'s $5,000 check and then cashed it without protest, the lawyer accepted the accord and satisfaction of the debt.

The toy company exercised no control over the actual design of the game; its only duties were to make the game according to the engineer\'s specifications and market it. A finding that the toy company was liable based on the engineer\'s defective design was a finding that the toy company was not an active wrongdoer.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect as this is not a joint enterprise issue because it can be established which individual caused the injury.

Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time.\" Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December. The final week\'s delay was caused by the photographer\'s not being notified promptly by the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm\'s length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, \"The photograph makes me look too old.

Where the existence of a particular person is necessary for the performance of a duty, his incapacity, if sufficient to make performance impracticable, may operate to excuse performance of the contract. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties\' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of \"[the customer] and his family,\" the customer\'s availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer\'s duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer\'s delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer\'s recovery, his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct (informing the photographer to \"take the photograph anyway\") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline.

The mother was not a party to the contract between the sister and the brother, so the only way for her to have contractual rights is if she was the intended beneficiary of the contract. For the mother to be an intended beneficiary, she must be the person to whom performance is to be given. In this case several factors indicate that the mother is an intended beneficiary: the mother is named in the contract, the mother directly receives the payments, and the mother has a close familial relationship with the parties. Therefore, the mother is an intended beneficiary and will prevail in a suit against the brother for the $500 payment.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because modern contract law is based upon the objective test, which does not consider a party\'s private intent. The brother\'s intent is irrelevant. Further, whether a contract was formed is not at issue.

With respect to an invitee, a business has a duty to make a reasonable inspection and a duty to warn of, or repair, known hazards on the premises. The duty to protect applies to defects that are: (1) known to the business, (2) dangerous, and (3) non-obvious to the invitee. This liability may be abated if the invitee became a trespasser by entering an area that was restricted and off-limits to visitors. If a customer wanders into an off-limits area, the only duty the business owes is to refrain from willful and wanton conduct.\r\n\r\nThe first issue in this question is the customer\'s status. The facts state that the customer went into an \"Employees Only\" area. However, an employee observed the plaintiff and allowed the entry. Therefore, the plaintiff is not a trespasser in this situation, but an invitee. Thus, A and B are incorrect. The second issue is whether the hazard was open and obvious, thus abating the drug store\'s liability. Choice D appropriately addresses the issue that the clerk had a duty to warn the plaintiff of the danger if he had reason to believe that the plaintiff was unaware of the open shaft.

Even if bowling were inherently dangerous, that characterization would support an argument for permitting recreational participants who appreciate the risks of the activity to assume the risks by signing a waiver rather than constituting a reason for ignoring the waiver. \r\n\r\nB is correct. Waivers are most easily justified when an activity poses inherent risks that are familiar to the participants and cannot be entirely eliminated without removing the pleasure from the activity. The risk that materialized here is not inherent to bowling but could arise whenever someone is careless while holding a heavy object. A court might find that it is against public policy to permit individuals or businesses to insulate themselves from the deterrent incentives provided by the threat of negligence liability. For that reason, the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and could hold the waiver ineffective. \r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Although the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and therefore hold the waiver to be no bar when the harm was due to the instructor\'s negligence, asking the woman to sign the waiver was not in itself negligent or unreasonable.

The nephew, hoping to collect his inheritance, intentionally caused the death of the man, and should be found guilty of criminal homicide. The issue in this question is what actions are sufficient to be considered as \"causing\" the death of another. The actions must be an actual and proximate cause of the victim\'s death, but they need not be the sole cause of death. In this case, the man was poisoned by his nephew, which weakened the man\'s heart, and eventually lead to his death, and is thus sufficient causation to sustain a homicide charge.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. The fact that a victim may have died in another manner if the defendant\'s actions were not taken is not a defense to a homicide charge.

The nephew\'s poisoning shortened the man\'s life, and the fact that the man may have died from a fatal illness, while it shows the nephew isn\'t so smart, does not serve as a defense to the charge of murder. The facts given show that the poison did weaken the man\'s heart, leading to the heart attack. Answer D is incorrect.

The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender\'s best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor\'s age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law. Because the bartender did not knowingly sell alcohol to the minor, he should be acquitted.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the fact that the purchaser could have presented a fake identification does not excuse the bartender\'s not asking to see it; his only legitimate excuse would be that he believed the person to be over 21 and that the statute includes a mens rea requirement. Answer B is incorrect because ignorance of the law is generally not an excuse, and the bartender\'s not being told that he has to check identification does not affect the offense\'s mens rea requirement. When a crime requires that the defendant act knowingly, he must have been aware that his conduct was of a particular nature, or at least know that his conduct will necessarily or very likely cause a particular result. Here, he must have been aware of the fact that he was selling to a minor, or to someone between the ages of 18 and 21, not the fact that his conduct was violating that regulation.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, again, ignorance of the law is no excuse, and not knowing that beer is an alcoholic beverage does not excuse the bartender\'s actions.

The child\'s death was the result, not of malice aforethought, but of criminal negligence on the part of the father. Failure to seek medical attention for an illness is generally insufficient for the finding of malice aforethought, so the father, in his criminal negligence, has committed involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because murder, at common law, requires that the killing be done with malice aforethought. Because the death resulted from an untreated illness, and there was no evidence that the father acted with either actual or implied malice toward his child, he is not guilty of murder. Answer C is incorrect because a person is only guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he successfully raises a heat of passion defense to a murder charge. There was no heat of passion defense raised, and, combined with a lack of evidence that the father intended his child to die, he cannot properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

The defendant\'s best argument for being found not guilty of felony murder is that he is not responsible for the customer\'s actions in shooting the clerk. The courts are split regarding whether a defendant is liable for felony murder when the death is caused by a third party. Under the proximate cause theory, a defendant can be liable where the innocent party is killed as the result of resistance from the victim or police. However, under the agency theory, the defendant will only be found liable for felony murder when someone is killed by a person acting as an accomplice of the defendant. Given that the customer is neither a victim nor the police, and that the customer is not an agent or an accomplice of the defendant, the defendant\'s best argument is that he is not responsible for the customer\'s actions. Therefore, answer D provides the best possible defense.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because felony murder does not require that the defendant have the specific intent to kill the clerk. It is sufficient that the underlying felony was dangerous and that the killing was foreseeable.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect because attempted robbery, even with a toy gun, is still dangerous enough to be considered a proper underlying felony for felony murder. Arguing that he did not actually complete the robbery is not the defendant\'s best argument for acquittal.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, once again, the defendant\'s intent to create a risk of harm is irrelevant under felony murder. Regardless of his intent that nobody get hurt, he did create a situation by committing a dangerous felony, and, if he bore criminal responsibility for the actor who did the killing, he would be found guilty.

To be guilty as an accomplice, the alleged accomplice must give aid, counsel, or encouragement to the principal with the intent to encourage the crime.

(105, 1, 19, 'The defendant, a worker in a metal working shop, had long been teasing a young colleague by calling him insulting names and ridiculing him. One day the colleague responded to the teasing by picking up a metal bar and attacking the defendant. The defendant could have escaped from the shop. Instead, he parried the blow with his left arm, and with his right hand struck the colleague on his jaw. The colleague died as a result of his injuries.\r\n\r\nCan the defendant be properly convicted of an offense?', 'The correct answer is D. When the defendant parried the colleague\'s blow and struck the colleague on the jaw, he was acting in self-defense and should not be convicted of any offense. A person can properly claim self-defense if the action taken is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent harm to himself from the use of unlawful force. In this case, the force the defendant used, a blow to the head, was reasonable in light of the attack on him by the colleague with a metal bar. Although he likely could have escaped the situation, the defendant was not required to retreat before using reasonable force for the situation. Finally, although generally the initial aggressor is not allowed to claim self-defense, in this question the defendant started by using words and not a physical attack. The colleague then responded unreasonably with deadly force. The defendant, then, although the initial aggressor, was able to respond in turn with deadly force. The defendant therefore has a proper claim to self-defense and should not be convicted of any crime. Thus, A and B are incorrect.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Here, the defendant intended to harm the colleague when he struck him in the jaw. He did intend to inflict great bodily injury when he responded to the colleague\'s attack on him.

The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a party who is subject to the condition, unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party.

However, the blade that was on the saw he picked out had very coarse teeth for cutting rough lumber. The purchaser told the storekeeper that he wanted a saw blade that would cut plywood. The storekeeper exchanged the coarse blade for a new one with finer teeth that would cut plywood smoothly. The new blade was manufactured by Saw-Blade Company, which uses all available techniques to inspect its products for defects. The reconditioned saw had been manufactured by Power Saw Company.\r\n\r\nThe week after the saw was purchased, the employee, who works for the purchaser in the purchaser\'s cabinet-making shop, was injured while using the saw.

Strict liability can be imposed upon the storekeeper for the sale of any product which is in a defective condition or unreasonably dangerous to the user. Liability for physical harm to the employee is available provided that: (1) the storekeeper is engaged in the business of selling reconditioned power saws, and (2) the power saw was not substantially changed by anyone else before the employee used it.

The storekeeper made no express representation to the purchaser or the employee about the power saw.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Res ipsa loquitur generally requires that the instrumentality that caused the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant.

On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler\'s assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender.\r\n\r\nWas the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?', 'Answer B is correct. UCC Â§ 2-612(2) provides that a buyer may reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. The delivery of less than the contracted-for amount constituted a nonconformity that substantially impaired the value of the installment since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs, and the bakery was entitled to reject the tender.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, but that rule is inapplicable to assess the conformance of a seller\'s performance under an installment contract. Because this is an installment contract, the substantial impairment standard governs the buyer\'s right to reject, and the bakery is entitled to reject under that standard. Under the substantial impairment standard, an installment can be rejected by the buyer only if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured. Furthermore, the whole contract is breached if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of the entire contract.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. UCC Â§ 2-612(2) provides that a buyer is entitled to reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. A buyer\'s right to reject a particular installment is not dependent on a substantial impairment of the entire contract. Moreover, in this case, the wholesaler\'s assurance of cure was inadequate since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. As stated above, a buyer\'s right to reject a delivery on an installment contract for the sale of goods is not governed by the perfect tender rule, but rather by the substantial impairment standard. Here, the bakery had the right to reject the second installment because the missing 5,000 pounds of flour could not be delivered for several days, substantially impairing the installment.

The facts indicate that the stove arrived exactly as it was designed. This is a defective design case.

A prisoner, who was imprisoned for a technical violation of a regulatory statute, happened to be standing next to the mobster when the photograph was taken.\r\n\r\nWhen the picture appeared in the press, the prisoner suffered severe emotional distress because he believed that his business associates and friends would think he was consorting with gangsters.

The prisoner brought an action against the photographer for intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best argument that the photographer can make in support of a motion for summary judgment?', 'D is the correct answer. A motion for summary judgmentwill be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For the prisoner to prevail in his claim for intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress, he must show that: (1) the photographer\'s intentional (with purpose or knowledge to a substantial certainty) or reckless disregard for the consequences of publishing the photograph was (2) extreme and outrageous conduct, which (3) caused the prisoner severe emotional distress. Thus B is incorrect because severe emotional distress can be evidenced physically, but physical harm is not required. The photographer clearly pointed his lens to take a picture, knowing to a substantial certainty that the mobster and his companions would be photographed as a result, so choice A will not help the photographer.

The driver of the car brought a strict liability action against the owner of the plant to recover for the damage to the car. \r\n\r\nIs the driver likely to prevail?', 'Answer A is correct. Although the manufacture of explosives may be an abnormally dangerous activity, strict liability for injuries caused by such activities is limited to the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. This accident could have occurred when a roof tile fell from a building that housed a perfectly safe and ordinary activity. The owner may, however, be liable for negligence. Thus, Answer A is correct and Answer C is incorrect. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the driver is not likely to prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The fact that the windstorm was unusually severe may be relevant to a negligence claim, where the case would turn on whether the owner took reasonable precautions to prevent the accident, but it is not relevant to a claim of strict liability. The strict liability claim fails because the risk that materialized was not of the sort that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Strict liability is based on the abnormally dangerous nature of the activity and is limited to the realization of the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. The inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on may be one factor in deciding whether the activity is abnormally dangerous, but it is not the only factor.

He often placed merchandise on the sidewalk, sometimes for short intervals, sometimes from 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Pedestrians from time to time stopped and gathered to look at the merchandise. A man had moved into an apartment which was situated immediately above the store; a street-level stairway entrance was located about twenty feet to the east. On several occasions, the man had complained to the store owner about the situation because not only were his view and peace of mind affected, but his travel on the sidewalk was made more difficult. The man owned and managed a restaurant two blocks to the west of his apartment and made frequent trips back and forth. There was a back entrance to his apartment through a parking lot; this entrance was about two hundred feet farther in walking distance from his restaurant. Once the man complained to the police, whereupon the store owner was arrested under a local ordinance which prohibited the placing of goods or merchandise on public sidewalks and imposed, as its sole sanction, a fine for its violation.\r\n\r\nOne day, the sidewalk in front of the store owner\'s store was unusually cluttered because he was cleaning and mopping the floor of his shop.

Although public nuisances generally must be prosecuted by public authorities, a public nuisance action by a private party is possible if the public nuisance causes a unique harm to the plaintiff that differs from the general harm to the public. The remedy for the public nuisance is usually damages. In this case, the man is asking for injunctive relief, which only is granted where damages are an unavailable or inadequate remedy. Since the man has alleged no injury for which damages (compensation for the injuries and a fine) would be inadequate, an injunction would probably be denied. Therefore, D provides the best defense for the store owner.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. A claim for nuisance does not have to be mitigated by removal, and remaining in proximity to the nuisance is not implied consent.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The issue is whether the interference with the safety and property rights of the community was unreasonable, not whether the violation of the ordinance was reasonable.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect as there is no remedy of self-help available to the man.

Any duty that the landlord may have is at most a duty to act reasonably.

The possessor of a vicious dog may be strictly liable to those injured by the dog, but the landlord here is not in possession of the dog. Moreover, the liability, where it exists, is limited to cases in which the possessor has reason to know that the dog is unusually dangerous. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. A landlord may have a nondelegable duty to protect persons who come upon the land from dangerous conditions of the property, such as cracked walks and broken stairs, but the presence of a dog that belongs to a tenant is not such a condition.

Because the sports car performed exactly as it was designed to perform, this is a defective design case. For strict liability to apply in defective design, the driver must prevail in a risk-utility balancing test where she must show that the risk and severity of her injuries were predictable to her as the driver of the sports car. In some jurisdictions, the court would then consider the feasibility of alternative designs. Other jurisdictions shift the burden to the defendant (once plaintiff proves causation) requiring the manufacturer to show that the utility of the design outweighs the inherent danger. The driver provided evidence that an alternative engine design of equal cost and performance was possible without the stalling flaw. Under the facts, the judge could find that the driver met her burden to show injury to herself as the result of a design flaw that was not technologically and economically burdensome for Rapido Company to correct. A directed verdict (also called Judgment as a Matter of Law) allows judgment if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that a reasonable person/jury could not disagree.

The airline company sued the delivery service based on a theory of the tortious interference with its contract. The tort of interference with contract provides a cause of action against those who improperly interfere with the performance of a contract between the plaintiff and a third person.

The proper defendant in the tort action would be the food company. See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 766. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the airline will not prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The airline could sue the food company for tortious interference even though it was not in privity with the food company, but it did not do so. It sued the delivery service instead.

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not.

As a result of the impact the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian\'s grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nA pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver\'s attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian\'s attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver\'s license expired two years prior to the collision.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the driver to have a valid driver\'s license has which of the following effects?', 'B is correct. In a negligence case, a plaintiff must establish that a duty of care was owed and that a breach of that duty occurred. Typically these elements are analyzed through common law principles. In some instances a statute may provide for the standard of care which should be used instead of the default common law duty. For a statutory standard of care to exist, two things must be true: (i) the harm that occurred was the type of harm that the statute was designed to protect against, and (ii) the plaintiff was of the class of people that the statute was designed to protect. If a statutory duty of care exists, then a violation of the statute would satisfy the elements of duty and breach in a negligence case. Courts sometimes call this negligence per se. Negligence per se, however, does not automatically furnish liability for negligence because the remaining elements of causation and damages must also be proven by the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nA majority of courts have held that a violation of a licensing statute does not constitute negligence per se. The courts have reasoned that unlicensed driving is not equivalent to negligent driving. The purpose of a driver\'s license is for registration and identification of drivers. The licensing statute was not designed to prevent pedestrians in crosswalks from being hit by licensed drivers. Therefore, violation of the statute would not establish negligence per se and would not furnish a basis for liability. Likewise, the lack of a license does not establish incompetence, so C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA and D are incorrect. Violation of a safety statute can be held as negligence per se, but lack of a license is not a safety statute violation, nor does it create trespasser status in the unlicensed driver.

The gun cabinet was normally locked. The grandmother had opened it for dusting several days before the boys\' visit, and had then forgotten to relock it. She was not aware that it was unlocked when the boys arrived. \r\n\r\nAt the trial on an action against a grandmother on behalf of the friend, the information above has been admitted into evidence.

A directed verdict (also called Judgment as a Matter of Law) allows judgment if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that a reasonable person/jury could not disagree. A directed verdict is entered at the close of the evidence before the matter goes to a jury. There are two potential claims at issue in this question. The first is whether the grandmother can be held vicariously liable for the grandson\'s tortious act. The grandmother has a duty to exercise reasonable care in the control of the grandson while he is physically within her care or custody. Liability, however, is generally limited to actions that were a known propensity of the child, and thus, foreseeable by the caretaker. A custodian of a child who fails to exercise control regarding the known propensity of that child is generally not vicariously liable for the child\'s tortious behavior; rather the caretaker is liable for his or her own negligence in failing to control the child. The facts clearly indicate that the grandson\'s behavior was not foreseeable to the grandmother.\r\n\r\nThe second issue, however, is whether the grandmother had a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff to take affirmative measures that would keep her grandson from using the gun. When the grandmother failed to remove the bullets from a stored gun and then forgot to relock the gun case, it was foreseeable that her grandson would find and play with the gun; she thereby failed in her duty to control the grandson\'s use of a dangerous instrumentality.\r\n\r\nA is the wrong conclusion. While the grandmother may not generally be liable for her grandson\'s tortious activities, she is liable for her own negligence.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect.

Trespass is the physical invasion of the real property of another, the intent to bring about that invasion, and causation. Intent refers only to the intent to enter the land; the defendant need not know that the land belongs to the plaintiff. Therefore, if the defendant intentionally drove his car onto the plaintiff\'s land, this would provide a sufficient basis for a trespass claim.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect.

Any user who is injured by a defective product can bring a products liability claim based on strict liability in tort as long as they can satisfy the requirements for the prima facie case. The four elements of the case are: (1) a strict duty owed by a commercial supplier, (2) breach of that duty, (3) actual and proximate causation, and (4) damages. In a products liability claim, the main difference between a negligence and strict liability claim is that the negligence standard of care is replaced with an absolute duty to make safe. In a strict liability case, the plaintiff need only prove that the product was unreasonably dangerous to show a breach of duty. Thus, in contrast to a negligence action, a retailer in a strict liability action may be liable simply because it was a commercial supplier of a defective product.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in a strict liability claim, the product must be expected to, and must in fact, reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is supplied. In this case, since the college student removed and disposed of the box containing the adequate warning before the shampoo reached the roommate, the product was substantially changed from the condition in which it was sold, and there is not adequate causation to sustain the roommate\'s claim.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The roommate\'s misuse of the product would not provide a defense to a strict liability action in a jurisdiction that maintains traditional contributory negligence rules. Even if the misuse rose to the level that the roommate was contributorily negligent, this is not a defense where the plaintiff simply failed to recognize the danger or guard against its existence. Therefore, B is also incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because privity is not required in a products liability claim based on strict liability, the injured party must only be a foreseeable user.

The rule of joint and several liability has been retained.\r\n\r\nThe jury has found that the plaintiff sustained damages in the amount of $100,000, and apportioned the causal negligence of the parties as follows: The plaintiff 40%, D-1 30%, and D-2 30%.\r\n\r\nHow much, if anything, can the plaintiff collect from D-1, and how much, if anything, can D-1 then collect from D-2 in contribution?', 'D is the correct calculation. Pure comparative negligence allows recovery by the plaintiff for all damages not attributed to his own negligence. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to $60,000, which is the $100,000 in damages he suffered minus his 40% of the fault. Since this is a joint and several liability jurisdiction, the defendants are each liable for the entire award. The plaintiff can collect the full amount of his award from either defendant or both, as long as the total only equals the $60,000 he is entitled to. The facts indicate that the jurisdiction allows contribution based on proportionate fault. The question asks how much (what is the most) the plaintiff can collect from D-1. Under joint and several liability, the plaintiff can collect up to his full award, here $60,000, from D-1. D-1 can then collect D-2\'s proportionate amount of the award in contribution, which is 30% of $100,000, or $30,000.

The police said that the woman was approximately 75 years old, had white hair, and drove a vintage, cream-colored Ford Thunderbird. Attendants were advised to call the police if they saw her, but to not attempt to apprehend her. Armed robbery is a felony under state law.\r\n\r\nA traveler was passing through the city on a cross-country journey. The traveler was a 75-year-old woman who had white hair and drove a vintage, cream-colored Ford Thunderbird. When the traveler drove into a gas station, the owner of the station thought the traveler must be the robber wanted by the police. After checking the oil at the traveler\'s request, the owner falsely informed the traveler that she had a broken fan belt, that her car could not be driven without a new belt, that it would take him about an hour to replace it, and that she should stay in his office for consultation about the repair. The traveler was greatly annoyed that her journey was delayed, but she stayed in the owner\'s office while she waited for her car. The owner telephoned the police and, within the hour, the police came and questioned the traveler. The police immediately determined that the traveler was not the woman, and the traveler resumed her journey without further delay.\r\n\r\nIn the traveler\'s action for false imprisonment against the owner, the traveler will', 'A is the correct answer. False imprisonment occurs when the plaintiff is confined against her will and is aware of the confinement, or has suffered actual injury. Here, the traveler was not confined to the office but was confined to the gas station premises through the owner\'s misrepresentation of fact. Actual injury is not required if the plaintiff was aware of her confinement. Thus B can be eliminated.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of legal justification. In this case, the owner is protected by the privilege of arrest. For a private citizen to make an arrest without a warrant when a felony has occurred, two things must be true: (i) a felony must have in fact been committed, and (ii) the private citizen must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested did commit the felony. The privilege is also limited by three factors: the amount of time of the detention, the amount of force used to detain, and the means of restraint must all be found reasonable. A is the correct answer because a felony has actually occurred, and the owner did reasonably believe that the traveler committed it. Therefore, he was legally justified in the detention of the traveler by the privilege of arrest.\r\n\r\nC and D are incorrect because any claim the traveler may have of false imprisonment would be beat out by the owner\'s privilege of arrest.', '2017-09-17 08:05:24', 1, '[\"not prevail, because the owner reasonably believed that the traveler was the wanted woman.\",\"not prevail, because the traveler suffered no physical or mental harm.\",\"prevail, because the traveler reasonably believed she could not leave the owner\'s premises.\",\"prevail, because the owner lied to the traveler about the condition of her car.\"]', 0, 'Intentional Torts'),

A guest of the hotel fell into the excavation, which the contractor had negligently left unguarded.\r\n\r\nIn an action by the guest against the hotel to recover for his injuries, what would be the most likely outcome?', 'Answer A is correct. Ordinarily, someone who hires an independent contractor would not be vicariously liable for the contractor\'s negligence. However, a landowner who holds his land open to the public has a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business visitors. Such a landowner is liable for any negligence that causes a guest to be injured by unsafe conditions on the premises, even the negligence of an independent contractor.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. While it is true that the hotel would most likely be liable, the contract between the hotel and the contractor is irrelevant to the hotel\'s potential liability to the guest. Should the guest successfully sue the hotel, the contract would allow the hotel to bring an action for indemnification against the contractor, but the contract does not affect the hotel\'s liability to its guests. The hotel\'s liability, as stated above, would arise from its nondelegable duty to the guest to keep a safe premises.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect.

If the hotel had not exercised reasonable care in selecting a contractor, that would be an alternative basis for imposing liability on the hotel.

He intended to come back and get the ladder the next morning. At that time, the homeowner and her family were away on a trip. During the night, a thief, using the ladder to gain access to an upstairs window, entered the house and stole some valuable jewels. The homeowner has asserted a claim against the roofer for damages for the loss of the jewels.\r\n\r\nIn her claim against the roofer, will the homeowner prevail?', 'B is correct. Generally an intentional tort, such as theft, is a superseding action that cuts off liability in a negligence analysis, unless the negligent act\'s foreseeable consequences include the same type of intentional or criminal acts. The ladder was left upright against a home where the family was away on a trip, in plain view for any thief to see. The roofer had a duty of ordinary care to remove his equipment, and it was certainly foreseeable that leaving the ladder at an unoccupied home would potentially result in its use as the instrumentality for a break-in. The burden to remove the ladder was slight compared to the potential severity of the harm. Because the roofer created a foreseeable risk, his liability is not cut off by the thief\'s intentional intervening act. Therefore, C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The roofer did not become a trespasser by leaving the ladder on the owner\'s property. His license to be on the property did not expire until his job was completed, which would include removal of his equipment. Thus, the issue of whether the roofer has a trespasser\'s liability for any damage caused to the owner\'s property does not apply.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect. This answer choice is meant to distract and confuse. This is not a contracts issue. The contract involved the making of repairs to the roof.

In an action brought by the customer against the store, these are the only facts in evidence.\r\n\r\nShould the trial judge permit the case to go to the jury?', 'Answer B is correct. Unlike slip-and-fall cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana peel does not indicate that it has been on the ground for any significant period of time. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support a jury verdict that the store staff was negligent in failing to remove it before the customer\'s fall.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the judge should not let the case go to the jury, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. In slip-and-fall cases, even if a customer was negligent, he could recover some of his damages under a system of pure comparative negligence if a jury determines that the grocer was also negligent. The case at issue, however, should not go to the jury, because there is no evidence to support a finding of negligence on the part of store staff, as explained above.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Strict products liability is not applicable here because the banana was not defective. Moreover, the case at issue should not go to the jury, because there is no evidence to support a finding of negligence on the part of store staff. The fact that the peel came from a banana offered for sale by the grocer is not evidence of negligence. Unlike cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana in the present case indicates that it had not been on the floor for a significant amount of time. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support a jury verdict that the store staff was negligent in failing to remove it before the customer\'s fall.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Foreseeability alone is not sufficient to establish that the grocer was negligent. The plaintiff must also offer evidence that the grocer fell below the standard of care, i.e., that he failed to adopt the precautions that a reasonably prudent person in his situation would adopt to avoid the foreseeable risk. There is no such evidence here.

Generally, there is no affirmative duty to act. However, four exceptions exist: (i) if the defendant voluntarily assumes a duty, (ii) if the peril was caused by the defendant\'s own conduct, (iii) if a special relationship exists between the parties; and (iv) if the defendant has a duty to control a third party. A person assumes a duty to act by voluntarily beginning to aid someone in peril. Once aid has begun, the actor has a duty to use reasonable care in continuing to administer aid. Here A is incorrect because there is no general duty to act to help a stranger, and there has been no assumption of duty either.\r\n\r\nB and C are also incorrect because, although there is a duty to act within a special relationship, neighbor and cousin generally do not fall within the category unless especially close or special for an additional reason. Common examples of special relationships that owe a duty of care are parent-child, employer-employee, common carriers and innkeepers, and parties in privity such as through contract.\r\n\r\nD is the correct answer because the defendant\'s own conduct gave rise to the situation of peril, creating an affirmative duty to aid or assist.

The seller had a duty of reasonable care for the safety of those outside the land to prevent harm resulting from conditions on the land. The facts indicate that ordinary windstorms had previously caused tile loss. Despite the fact that the seller just sold the home, he was or should have been aware of the dangerous condition of the roof and the foreseeability of harm to persons outside the premises from windswept falling tiles. Instead, he left the dangerous conditions without taking precautionary measures to protect against dislodged tiles. It is irrelevant that the seller was no longer the owner or occupier of the house; the seller\'s negligent conduct was a breach of his duty of care and proximately caused the pedestrian\'s injuries, thus choice C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. This is not a products liability issue; it is a failure to exercise reasonable care issue. The seller was a negligent user/owner of a property, not a manufacturer of a defective product. Thus, the pedestrian must assert a claim for negligence, not strict liability. The seller is still liable for his own negligent conduct as it affected the house, even if he has just sold the property at issue.

A private nuisance is substantial and unreasonable interference with a possessor\'s use or enjoyment of his property.

In making this determination, the court will consider the neighborhood, land value, and alternative courses of conduct for the defendant.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the interference is unreasonable because the injury outweighs the utility of the feed lot. Due to the growth of the city, there are now a substantial number of residences near the feed lot. Furthermore, while the cattle company\'s land is worth $300,000, the company has only invested $25,000 in the establishment of the feed lot, and is severely impairing the use of between $125,000 to $200,000 worth of residential property.

While the rancher\'s belief that deadly force was necessary to protect himself from harm may have been actual, it was not reasonable. To justify the use of force sufficient to cause death or serious bodily injury, a defendant must have more than a subjective suspicion that such force is necessary. A defendant must have an actual and reasonable belief that he himself is threatened with force of that sort. In this case, the rancher\'s belief that the neighbor was armed was not reasonable, nor did he have a reasonable belief that the neighbor meant to harm him. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer B is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The majority of states that recognize a right to stand one\'s ground rather than retreat limit the right to an owner who is confronted in his home, not one simply standing outside on land that he owns. Also, even if the rancher had no obligation to retreat, he used deadly force, which was not justifiable unless he had a reasonable belief that he himself was threatened with that degree of force and needed to use deadly force to defend himself. The disparity in numbers here, as well as the fact that the rancher\'s belief that the defendant was armed was not supported by any evidence, indicate that his decision to shoot was unreasonable.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. It is true that force sufficient to cause serious bodily injury cannot be used to protect property, but a property dispute can escalate to a situation in which the participants are in danger of bodily harm. In this case, the rancher will argue that he feared that the neighbor was going to shoot him.

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car was driven by a driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. The pedestrian had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0.02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian\'s grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver\'s attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian\'s attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver\'s license expired two years prior to the collision.\r\n\r\nThe violation of the crosswalk statute by the pedestrian should not defeat her cause of action against the driver because', 'D is the correct answer. The question instructs an analysis based on the use of a safety statute. To determine why the pedestrian should prevail in her cause of action despite her violation of the crosswalk statute, look to the rule. Safety statutes are used only if the statute violated was designed to protect the particular class of foreseeable victim that the plaintiff belonged to, and the harm the plaintiff suffered was the type that the statute was designed to protect.

A person has the privilege to use deadly force in self-defense only if he reasonably believes that he is in danger of serious bodily harm. The facts state that the robber shot his gun at the guard. The guard was therefore privileged to use the force that appeared necessary to prevent the harm, in this case returning fire.

Transferred privilege applies as a defense when, in the reasonable exercise of self-defense by the defendant, a third party is accidentally injured.

B is incorrect because although there was transferred intent, the guard\'s actions are protected by the privilege of self-defense.

The fact that the replacement may have been a better actress suggests that any breach by the original actress was partial because the agent was easily made whole during the actress\'s absence.\r\n\r\nC and D are incorrect.

The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $500,000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15, the landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30, the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then, but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. When the landowner tendered the deed and possession on January 30, the farmer refused to accept either, and refused to pay the $500,000.

These facts do not suggest excuse on grounds of impossibility. C is incorrect. Although the landowner\'s failure to deliver possession was a breach, it was only a partial breach. D is incorrect.

The presumed wide availability of credit limits a borrower\'s recovery to the additional cost of obtaining a loan from another lender. In the typical case, a lender has no reason, at the time of contract formation, to foresee that a borrower will not be able to obtain a substitute loan. Furthermore, at the time of contract formation under these facts, the bank was not aware and had no reason to be aware of the merchant\'s opportunity to purchase the carpets. Therefore, the merchant\'s recovery is limited to the difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and one at 8%.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Damages for lost opportunities may be recoverable in some cases as consequential damages for a breach of contract. However, consequential damages for the lost opportunity to purchase the carpets are not appropriate under these facts for two reasons.

The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery.

This question doesn\'t raise an issue of waiver or retraction of a waiver, because there is no indication that payment within 15 days at a 5% discount is inconsistent with the parties\' agreement. In fact, the seller\'s invoice is silent on the matter. Instead, the question goes to the meaning of the agreement made by the parties.

An attempted retraction is ineffective, however, if it occurs after the injured party has materially changed its position in reliance on the repudiation.

The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $18,000.

This rule is intended to protect the substantial reliance of the offeree that results when accepting an offer for a unilateral contract by performance over a period of time.

An offeree\'s power of acceptance may terminate due to a lapse of time when the offeree fails to accept the offer within the time stated in the offer or within a reasonable time. In this case, the offer did not include an express time limitation. Therefore, the buyer could accept within a reasonable period of time. The email exchanges between the buyer and the seller demonstrate that the buyer accepted the seller\'s offer within a reasonable time period.

The 100 bolts were shipped, and the buyer paid the seller. Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. The buyer thereupon tendered back the wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment. The seller refused on the ground that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool.\r\n\r\nCan the buyer resell the wool?', 'Answer B is correct.  When a seller has delivered nonconforming goods, and the buyer justifiably revokes acceptance, the buyer has a security interest in the goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price. The buyer may hold such goods and resell them in the same manner as an aggrieved seller. The buyer, in this case, becomes a person in the same position as a seller and has the same remedies as a seller. Therefore the buyer can resell the goods at either a public or private sale, the same way an aggrieved seller could. For these reasons, Answer D is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Although it is true that the buyer may resell goods at a private sale, this right only exists if the seller is given reasonable notice. Because this answer choice makes no reference to notice to the seller, Answer B is a more thorough choice than Answer A.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect.  As stated above, the buyer may resell goods at either a public or private sale.

The contract contained the following provision: \"It is understood and agreed that the purchaser\'s obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of said apartment house.\"\r\n\r\nWhich of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?', 'C is correct. This question deals with the distinction between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent, and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions that can occur together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. Therefore, each condition acts as a condition precedent to the other. Finally, a condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs. C is the least accurate statement because the purchaser\'s tendering of good title to the farm does not excuse the building owner\'s duty to convey good title to the apartment house.\r\n\r\nHere, the building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser, and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner, or no further duty arises for either party. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after), the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment. Therefore, the building owner\'s conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser\'s tender of the farm are concurrent conditions, and in effect, each is a condition \"precedent\" to the other.

The subcontractor then breached by unjustifiably refusing to perform further. The contractor reasonably spent $120,000 to have the work completed by another subcontractor.\r\n\r\nThe subcontractor sues the contractor for the reasonable value of benefits conferred, and the contractor counterclaims for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following should be the court\'s decision?', 'Answer C is correct. A party in breach generally is entitled to restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the way of part performance in excess of any loss to the non-breaching party resulting from the breach. In measuring restitution to the breaching party, the value of the benefit conferred should not exceed the contract price for such services. The subcontractor appears to have entered into a losing contract, since the value of the services rendered up to the time of breach ($150,000) exceeds the contract rate for such services ($100,000). But because the subcontractor was the breaching party, he is not entitled to recover the amount by which the reasonable value of his services exceeded the contract rate; rather he is limited to restitution of what he would have earned on the contract.\r\n\r\nBecause the subcontractor has already been given progress payments of $100,000 for the work, there is no basis for restitution to the subcontractor. The contractor, however, is entitled to the damages resulting from the subcontractor\'s breach. Specifically, the contractor may recover the additional $20,000 cost of hiring another subcontractor to complete the work that the subcontractor refused to do.

A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to a duty. Constructive conditions of exchange can be waived through conduct, by treating a breach as only a partial breach and continuing to perform the contract. Although a waiver may be retractable in certain situations, a waiver is not retractable once the non-waiving party has relied on the waiver. When the corporation accepted only two game-designs per year during the first three years of the contract, the corporation implicitly waived the computer whiz\'s breach of the annual-quantity term of the contract. The computer whiz relied on this waiver when he spent substantial sums on equipment for future design work. Therefore, it would be unjust to allow the corporation, without prior notice, to claim that the computer whiz breached the annual-quantity term in year four.

When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the other party\'s performance, the other may make a written demand for adequate assurances of performance and suspend return performance if commercially reasonable.

The victim of a breach is entitled to recover only those damages which could not reasonably have been avoided. Failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages defeats only a claim for consequential damages. It does not deprive the victims of the breach of the opportunity to claim damages measured by the difference between contract and market price.

However, consideration is required for a settlement to be enforceable. Under the preexisting duty rule, the creditor\'s promise to forbear from suing to collect was not supported by consideration from the debtor, because the amount due was liquidated and the debtor promised to do nothing more than he was already obligated to do.

Under Article 2, evidence of trade usage that can be construed as reasonably consistent with an agreement\'s express language is admissible to interpret or supplement an agreement. The majority rule provides that trade usage will be viewed as consistent with an agreement\'s express language unless the usage completely negates specific express language. The trade usage allowing for a variation of up to 5% does not completely negate but rather qualifies the express language calling for the delivery of 100,000 bushels of wheat. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the rule stated above applies regardless of whether the written agreement is a complete integration.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Under UCC Â§ 2-601, the applicable standard for determining breach of a non-installment transaction involving a sale of goods is the perfect tender rule and not the substantial performance standard. However, the offered evidence of trade usage would establish that there was no breach; according to the trade usage standards, the farmer\'s delivery of 96,000 bushels was performance that conformed to the agreement.', '2017-09-26 09:14:41', 1, '[\"No, because the offered evidence is inconsistent with the express language of the agreement.\",\"No, because the written contract was totally integrated.\",\"Yes, because the offered evidence demonstrates that the farmer substantially performed the contract.\",\"Yes, because the offered evidence explains or supplements the agreement by usage of trade.\"]', 3, 'Contract Content and Meaning'),

Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company.\r\n\r\nThe fabric company promptly made an \"assignment of the contract\" to a finance company as security for a $100,000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered, took delivery of, and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5,000) for the new enterprise\'s requirement of the fabric for the first month of its operation.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after making the $5,000 payment to the fabric company, the new business enterprise, by written notice to the fabric company, terminated the agreement for purchase of the elasticized fabric because market conditions had in fact forced the new business enterprise out of the clothing manufacture business. In an immediate suit by the finance company against the new business enterprise for total breach, which of the following would be useful in the new business enterprise\'s defense?', 'Answer D is correct. A party\'s obligations under a requirements contract subject to the UCC are measured by good faith. A shut-down by a requirements buyer due to lack of orders or market conditions meets the good faith standard.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because unless there are circumstances suggesting otherwise, a clause prohibiting the assignment of the \"contract\" will be construed as barring only the delegation of the assignor\'s duties. See UCC Â§2-210. Therefore, the clause would not affect the assignment of payment made by the fabric company to the finance company. Furthermore, a party\'s contractual right is only personal where the nature of the contract is such that the assignment would impair the other party\'s reasonable expectations or would offend public policy. Assignment of a right to payment of money is not the assignment of a personal right.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because the \"assignment of the contract\" was expressly made to a creditor of the fabric company. Rights are assigned and duties are delegated. The use of \"assignment\" language, and the fact that the assignment was made to a creditor, reasonably indicates that the fabric company did not delegate its duties under the contract.

Where a court finds a contract to be unconscionable at the time that the contract is made, it may refuse to enforce the contract or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable term. Unconscionability has been defined as including both procedural and substantive elements: procedural unconscionability refers to defects in the bargaining process that leave a party with no meaningful choice, and substantive unconscionability refers to contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed in light of the situation existing at the time that the contract was made, it appears that both elements are present here: the landholder was in desperate financial straits and ignorant of the value of the rights that he was selling, and the terms of the contract grant timber rights to the logger for a price that is 70% below the market rate. A is incorrect because the mere fact that the logger won the contract with a below-market bid does not suggest bad faith. B is incorrect because there is no evidence of a statement of fact that would give rise to an estoppel.

So even if Pervis did not intend to hit him (to simply frighten him) that â€œassaultâ€ would become a battery by transferred intent anyway, and Bob is going to sue Pervis for battery instead of assault.

That narrows the problem down to a choice between (A) and (B). Since the facts donâ€™t say if Pervis intentionally shot the gun or if it went off by accident, Bob would be wise to accuse Pervis of BOTH battery and negligence.

Maybe he actually saw a real deer and shot the cow by accident. Conversion is an intentional interference with chattel of plaintiffs that substantially deprives the plaintiffs of the use of their property. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, conversion, p. 30.] Here if Hunter deliberately shot Farmerâ€™s cow, thinking it was a deer, it would amount to conversion and (A) would be true. But if Hunter was shooting at something else, whether it was a real deer or not, missed and hit Farmerâ€™s cow by accident it would not be an intentional tort. In that case it would be negligence and (B) would be true. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligence, p. 44.] Since both (A) and (B) could be true, neither is the best answer and you have to choose between (C) and (D).

Second, it would not be true if the National Forest was a â€œfree rangeâ€ area where cows are legally allowed to roam. And it would not be a good answer if the jurisdiction had adopted the â€œlast clear chanceâ€ doctrine, because even if Farmer was negligent, Hunter had the last clear chance to avoid shooting it.

(A) is wrong because both actual and proximate causation must be proven.

(390, 1, 32, '24. Pablo was an internationally famous movie star. He flew all over the world to act in movies, appear at debuts, appear on talk shows and rub elbows with the rich and famous. He booked a flight on Agony Airlines to fly to an appearance in New York City. When he arrived at the airport he found out that he had been booked to a coach seat when his agent had expressly requested a first-class seat in the first three rows.\r\n\r\nPablo was reluctant to be seen in coach because it would hurt his image to be seen with common people. And he wanted to be in the first three rows of first-class because it gave him a buzz to see the looks he got from the coach passengers as they filed down the aisle past him to their decidedly inferior locations. He called his agent and had his agent negotiate with Agony to get him a first-class seat in the first three rows. His agent told him he was only able to get him a seat in row 5. Pablo reluctantly agreed because he really needed to get to New York to push his latest film, â€œEscape from Arizonaâ€.\r\n\r\nAfter Pablo was seated the remaining passengers filed past him. One of them was Wesley Snipes, passenger 57.\r\n\r\nThere were no problems with the flight until it approached La Guardia. A mutant strain of killer geese had invaded Long Island Sound from Canada and there was a danger they might attack the planeâ€™s jet engines as they landed. For passenger safety the plane was diverted to JFK. As the plane landed an alarm went off indicating that one of the landing gear devices had malfunctioned and the plane might crash on landing. The plane circled until there was no choice but to land.\r\n\r\nThe captain told the passengers and crew about the problem and everyone was warned to assume the normal position for a crash landing. When the plane touched down the landing gear collapsed and several passengers in first-class were injured, but Snipes and the rest of the passengers in coach were not injured.\r\n\r\nAfter the crash Agony Airlines admitted flying an airplane is an abnormally dangerous activity. Then it filed for bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIf Pablo was injured, Agony admits airline travel is an abnormally dangerous activity, and there is no statutory provision governing his claim against Agony, Pablo will most likely:\r\n', '(D) The lesson to be learned here is that multiple-choice exams may present single questions based on exceedingly long fact patterns. These use up a lot of your time, yet you can only score â€œone pointâ€ if you get it right. So if you are running behind on time or even running out of time mark these long questions with a big â€œXâ€ and simply select one of the possible answers at random. You have a 25% chance of getting the answer right anyway. And there is no penalty for wrong answers. Then if you have some extra time after you have completed the rest of the exam come back to these few questions and reconsider them. The same strategy can be used when you are stumped between two possible answers for a question. Simply mark the question (e.g. if you canâ€™t decide between (A) and (B) mark it â€œA-B???â€), select one of the possible answers on the answer sheet, and move on! DO NOT WASTE TIME AGONIZING OVER A DECISION BETWEEN TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS. Here (C) is wrong because the defendant admits it was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.

(A) and (B) are wrong because they assume the airline will be liable simply because strict liability applies. (D) is correct because the only affirmative defense in a strict liability situation is assumption of the risks and one of the (obvious) risks of air travel is that the plane might crash.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligent entrustment, p. 62 and negligent contracting, p. 63.] (C) is wrong because parents are not responsible for the acts of their children. While some States may have statutes that make parents responsible for tortious acts of their minor children (e.g. California does), that is not the common law or a broadly adopted modern rule that you should apply on law school and Bar exams. (D) is wrong because there is no basis on which to find the Parentis owed Farmer a duty.

There is no evidence they knew the children had trespassed into Farmerâ€™s shed, or that it posed any danger to Farmer, even if they did. (B) is correct because the children had gone into his shed before, so there is no basis to conclude they would not have gone into the shed again even if the Parentis had not hired Barbara.

Under the UCC\'s firm offer rule, an offer by a merchant for the sale of goods contained in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it is firm will be irrevocable, notwithstanding lack of consideration, for the time stated in the offer (or if no time is stated, for a reasonable time), but in no case may the period of irrevocability exceed three months. If the three-month period lapses and no consideration is given to support an option, then the offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance (or before it lapses). Because the retailer\'s firm offer was not supported by consideration, it became revocable as of March 15. However, the lawyer accepted the offer before the retailer revoked it and before the offer lapsed (because the offer stated that it would be open for the entire year); therefore, the retailer is bound to a contract to supply the paper.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because a firm offer becomes revocable after three months unless consideration is given to support an option.

The general contractor used the wallpaper hanger\'s $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors\' Building. Before the bids were opened, the wallpaper hanger truthfully advised the general contractor that the former\'s telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked. Shortly thereafter, the general contractor was awarded the Doctors\' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with another paperhanger for a price of $18,000. The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover $4,000.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor\'s prospect of recovery?', 'Answer B is correct. Unless the promisor has given an option promise supported by consideration, generally an offer is freely revocable until the time of acceptance. However, an offer may be irrevocable to the extent necessary to avoid injustice if the offeror should reasonably expect the offer to induce substantial reliance on the part of the offeree and where there is reliance in fact. The terms of the wallpaper hanger\'s offer suggest that the wallpaper hanger expected the general contractor to rely on his bid by utilizing it in calculating the general contractor\'s overall bid, and the general contractor in fact did rely on his bid. The fact that the general contractor was required to submit a bid bond to guarantee her bid demonstrates the substantial nature of the general contractor\'s reliance, because it shows the general contractor cannot pass the additional wallpapering cost on to the owner. Therefore this fact, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor\'s case for recovery.\r\n\r\nA, C and D are incorrect because, although each of these factors (mitigation of damages, the wallpaper hanger\'s negligence and the general contractor\'s good faith) may weigh in the general contractor\'s favor, the wallpaper hanger revoked her bid prior to the general contractor\'s acceptance.

In this case, to avoid a reduction in her damages, the businesswoman is required to do more than remain ready to work.

The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. A wrongfully discharged employee is expected to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to seek comparable employment. However, if no comparable employment is reasonably available and the businesswoman does not take another job, the businesswoman is entitled to recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years. \r\n\r\nC is incorrect. The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment was probably not a material breach of contract. It represented only a small part of a large contract and can easily be remedied by an award of damages. But even if the breach was material, a court would likely employ the concept of divisibility to preclude the businesswoman from rescinding the contract of sale. As stated in Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 240, a contract is divisible where \"the performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded as agreed equivalents.\" Here, the agreed equivalents would be the sale of the business and the corresponding $25 million purchase price, and the businesswoman\'s promise to work for the company and the corresponding yearly salary of $150,000. Applying this concept, the businesswoman would be able to recover damages for the company\'s breach of its promise to employ her, but she would not be permitted to rescind the contract of sale. \r\n\r\nD is incorrect. The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. The general rule is that employers cannot obtain specific performance requiring an employee who has breached a personal services contract to work for the employer. It is also true generally that courts refuse to grant specific performance of an employment contract against a breaching employer.

Under the UCC, a party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract.

The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery.\r\n\r\nIs the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?', 'Answer A is correct. The issue here is the interpretation of the term \"permanent employment\" in the bakery-chef contract. It is well established that \"permanent employment\" means \"employment-at-will\" in this context. In an employment-at-will relationship, either party can terminate the agreement at any time, without the termination being considered a breach (unless the termination were to violate an important public policy â€” which is not the case here). Accordingly, the chef is not liable for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the bakery will not prevail in a breach of contract action against the chef, but it misstates the reason why this is so. The question whether the job the baker took with the hotel was comparable to the one she left at the bakery is not relevant here. The comparability issue DOES arise in cases in which an employee who has been terminated is offered another job; in such cases the employee\'s claim for breach would be reduced by wages which could have been earned at jobs which are not different and inferior. That is not the case in this problem.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because it is grounded in an incorrect interpretation of the meaning of the word \"permanent\" in the context of employment agreements, as explained above.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it presumes the existence of an \"implied right of first refusal.\" While some contracts do create rights of first refusal, such rights must be created by express agreement, and not by implication. In the context of employment agreements, it is well established that \"permanent employment\" means \"employment-at-will.\" In an employment-at-will relationship, either party can terminate the agreement at any time, without the termination being considered a breach (unless the termination were to violate an important public policy â€” which is not the case here).

Unless the other party to the contract (the obligee, or the chef) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor (the decorator).

In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by consideration. Consideration is a return promise or performance which is bargained-for, i.e., sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of consideration as long as the consideration was bargained-for; it is often said that \"even a peppercorn will suffice\" for consideration. In exchange for the chef\'s promise to pay the sister $6,000, the sister agreed to convey (and promptly conveyed) to the chef a quitclaim deed for a piece of property. Although the sister was aware that her claim to the property was doubtful, and although the deed contained no warranty of title, her promise to convey the quitclaim deed was sufficient consideration to support the chef\'s promise.\r\n\r\nChoice A is incorrect because what matters for finding consideration is the existence of an exchange, even if the values exchanged are unequal (the answer would be different if, instead of giving the quitclaim deed, the sister had promised to forbear from bringing a claim that she knew was doubtful).

When her son found out that the house had been sold and was not part of his mother\'s estate, he sued to have the contract avoided on behalf of the mother. \r\n\r\nOn what ground would the contract most likely be avoided?', 'Answer D is correct. A contract is voidable if the elements of undue influence--undue susceptibility to pressure and excessive pressure--are established. The undue susceptibility element can be established either by the circumstances (e.g., the mother\'s illness) or the existence of a confidential relationship (such as a parent-child relationship). The following facts support a finding of excessive pressure: the daughter\'s statement that she might not visit her mother, the daughter pressuring her mother to sell the property while her mother was in a hospice facility, the mother assenting without obtaining independent advice, and the mother\'s susceptibility to pressure.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. A contract can be avoided on the basis of duress. However, the facts fail to establish the elements of duress. Duress requires an improper threat. The daughter\'s statement that she might not visit her mother does not constitute an improper threat sufficient to support avoidance based on duress.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. If a bargained-for exchange is present, there is no additional requirement, such as an equivalency of exchange, to satisfy the consideration requirement of an enforceable contract. Moreover, the imbalance in the exchange between the mother and her daughter does not constitute the gross inadequacy of exchange that so shocks the conscience as to warrant invalidating the agreement.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect.

Because the fixtures company-apartment complex contract is an installment contract and because the fixtures company gave assurances that the defective shipment would be cured within five days, the apartment complex must accept the rest of the shipment and would not be justified in canceling the rest of the contract.\r\n\r\nA and B are incorrect because the UCC\'s \"perfect tender\" rule (which entitles a buyer to reject a tender of delivery that fails in any respect to conform to the contract) does not apply to installment contracts. C is incorrect because a buyer under an installment contract may treat the contract as breached only if the non-conformity of one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the contract as a whole.', '2017-10-02 10:11:25', 1, '[\"The apartment complex is entitled to accept any number of the 24 sets, reject the rest, and cancel the contract both as to any rejected sets and the lot due on April 1.\",\"The apartment complex is entitled to accept any number of the 24 sets and to reject the rest, but is not entitled to cancel the contract as to any rejected sets or the lot due on April 1.\",\"The apartment complex must accept the 24 sets but is entitled to cancel the rest of the contract.\",\"The apartment complex must accept the 24 sets and is not entitled to cancel the rest of the contract.\"]', 3, 'Performance, Breach, and Discharge'),

(663, 1, 22, 'An agent engaged an inexperienced actress to do a small role in a new Broadway play for a period of six months at a salary of $200 a week. The actress turned down another role in order to accept this engagement. On the third day of the run, the actress was hospitalized with influenza and a replacement was hired to do the part. A week later, the actress recovered, but the agent refused to accept her services for the remainder of the contract period. The actress then brought an action against the agent for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the actress\'s best legal theory?', 'D is correct. Under the Doctrine of Constructive Conditions, a party\'s material breach of an obligation, if uncured, may discharge the other party\'s obligation under the contract. Therefore, the agent\'s obligation may only be discharged if the actress\'s inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the actress may cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress\'s failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit under the contract. If the actress is found not to have materially breached, then the agent\'s failure to accept her services for the remainder of the engagement would, in turn, be found to be a material breach. This answer offers the best legal theory because none of the other answers offer the actress a basis for arguing breach of contract.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Even if the contract were severable, it is not relevant to whether the agent\'s remaining obligation to engage the actress may be discharged.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. Although impossibility of performance could provide a basis for excuse for the actress, it would not support the actress\'s argument that the agent breached the contract.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. The issue presented is not whether the agent owed a duty to the actress on the basis of reliance or otherwise (he clearly did, based on the agreement between them), but rather whether the agent breached that duty.', '2017-10-06 05:21:31', 1, '[\"Her acting contract with the agent was legally severable into weekly units.\",\"Her performance of the literal terms of the contract was physically impossible.\",\"Her reliance on the engagement with the agent by declining another acting role created an estoppel against the agent.\",\"Her failure to perform for one week was not a material failure so as to discharge the agent\'s duty to perform.\"]', 3, 'Performance, Breach, and Discharge'),

The woman promised to pay the seller, \"as soon as I am able.\" The woman subsequently repudiated this promise and refused to pay the seller anything.\r\n\r\nWhat effect does this quoted language have on enforceability of the promise?', 'Answer D is correct. A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms, the promisor unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances (e.g., \"I\'ll buy it if I feel like it.\"). Such a promise is an illusory promise. The modern approach, however, is to construe a promise wherever possible so as not to be illusory. This can be done, for example, by reading into the promise an obligation to exercise discretion in good faith. So long as the promisor has limited her freedom of action in some way, the court will find consideration sufficient to enforce the return promise. When the woman promised to pay $100 \"as soon as I am able,\" she limited her freedom of action in that she will become obligated to pay the purchase price when it can be demonstrated that she has the ability to pay.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect.  A voidable promise occurs when a party to the contract has the power to disaffirm the agreement.  This occurs when there a legal reason to render the agreement unenforceable including fraud, duress and infancy.  As stated above, there is valid consideration to enforce the return promise.  Therefore, it is not a voidable promise.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because a court will construe the quoted language as limiting the woman\'s freedom of action in some way. This limitation will be sufficient consideration to enforce the return promise. C is incorrect because the seller (and not the woman) will bear the burden of demonstrating that the condition has been satisfied.', '2017-10-06 05:23:11', 1, '[\"It makes the promise voidable.\",\"It makes the promise illusory.\",\"It requires the woman to prove her inability to pay.\",\"It requires the seller to prove the woman\'s ability to pay.\"]', 3, 'Formation of Contracts'),

The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower, operated the farm, and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed.

One of the stupidest falsehoods ever foisted on law students is the so-called â€œDeadly Weapon Doctrineâ€. A â€œdeadly weaponâ€ is simply any object used in a manner calculated to cause a homicide. It does not have to be a gun or knife, and guns and knives are NOT â€œdeadly weaponsâ€ if they are used in a manner that is not â€œcalculated to cause deathâ€. The term â€œcalculated to cause deathâ€ means used in a manner that is intended to kill. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, intent to kill, p. 69.] (B) is correct because Donâ€™s use of the gun to shoot Vic in the foot supports a finding of â€œintent to cause great bodily injuryâ€, and it caused a death, and those two facts support either a murder conviction or a finding of involuntary manslaughter. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, intent to cause great bodily injury, p. 70.] The fact Vic died because of an allergic reaction is irrelevant because Donâ€™s act was the actual and proximate cause of Vicâ€™s death.

Modernly burglary still requires proof of a trespassory entry, and if that is proven it generally supports a finding of â€œconstructive breakingâ€.

For there to be a â€œburglaryâ€ under the common law there must be an entry of a dwelling in the night. That did not happen here, so this could only be a â€œmodern law burglaryâ€. A modern law burglary still requires a â€œtrespassory entryâ€ and here the store is open for business. That means Sonny has permission to enter the store.

Maybe he actually saw a real deer and shot the cow by accident. Conversion is an intentional interference with chattel of plaintiffs that substantially deprives the plaintiffs of the use of their property. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, conversion, p. 30.] Here if Hunter deliberately shot Farmerâ€™s cow, thinking it was a deer, it would amount to conversion and (A) would be true. But if Hunter was shooting at something else, whether it was a real deer or not, missed and hit Farmerâ€™s cow by accident it would not be an intentional tort. In that case it would be negligence and (B) would be true. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligence, p. 44.] Since both (A) and (B) could be true, neither is the best answer and you have to choose between (C) and (D).

Second, it would not be true if the National Forest was a â€œfree rangeâ€ area where cows are legally allowed to roam. And it would not be a good answer if the jurisdiction had adopted the â€œlast clear chanceâ€ doctrine, because even if Farmer was negligent, Hunter had the last clear chance to avoid shooting it.

(A) is wrong because both actual and proximate causation must be proven.

As the burglar was climbing down the ladder shattered, the burglar was badly injured and Owenâ€™s TV was destroyed.\r\n\r\nIs Bill liable to the burglar for negligence?', '(A) Answer (A) is the best answer because the ladder was a â€œhidden danger on the land of Owenâ€. Owen was gone, so Bill was temporarily the â€œoccupierâ€ of the land. Under the common law he had no duty to â€œunforeseeable, unknown trespassersâ€.

The plane had to make an unscheduled stop in Bangor, Maine to unclog the toilet system, and it skidded off the icy runway, badly injuring Cheech.\r\n\r\nIf Cheech sues Chong:', '(C) Answers (A) and (B) are wrong because the accident was not caused by Chong smoking in violation of the FAA rule. Rather it was caused by him flushing the plastic wrap down the toilet after he finished smoking. If Chong had done the same thing (flushing the plastic) without ever smoking at all, Cheech still would have been injured. Therefore, Chongâ€™s breach of the FAA rule was not the actual cause of Cheechâ€™s injury. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, actual cause, p. 3.] (C) is correct because if he could not reasonably foresee his actions were putting anyone in danger he had no duty based on peril. . [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, duties created by peril, p. 49.] It could be argued that he assumed a duty to obey Agony Air rules when he bought his ticket.

He booked a flight on Agony Airlines to fly to an appearance in New York City. When he arrived at the airport he found out that he had been booked to a coach seat when his agent had expressly requested a first-class seat in the first three rows.\r\n\r\nPablo was reluctant to be seen in coach because it would hurt his image to be seen with common people. And he wanted to be in the first three rows of first-class because it gave him a buzz to see the looks he got from the coach passengers as they filed down the aisle past him to their decidedly inferior locations. He called his agent and had his agent negotiate with Agony to get him a first-class seat in the first three rows. His agent told him he was only able to get him a seat in row 5. Pablo reluctantly agreed because he really needed to get to New York to push his latest film, â€œEscape from Arizonaâ€.\r\n\r\nAfter Pablo was seated the remaining passengers filed past him. One of them was Wesley Snipes, passenger 57.\r\n\r\nThere were no problems with the flight until it approached La Guardia. A mutant strain of killer geese had invaded Long Island Sound from Canada and there was a danger they might attack the planeâ€™s jet engines as they landed. For passenger safety the plane was diverted to JFK. As the plane landed an alarm went off indicating that one of the landing gear devices had malfunctioned and the plane might crash on landing. The plane circled until there was no choice but to land.\r\n\r\nThe captain told the passengers and crew about the problem and everyone was warned to assume the normal position for a crash landing.

You have a 25% chance of getting the answer right anyway. And there is no penalty for wrong answers. Then if you have some extra time after you have completed the rest of the exam come back to these few questions and reconsider them. The same strategy can be used when you are stumped between two possible answers for a question.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligent entrustment, p. 62 and negligent contracting, p. 63.] (C) is wrong because parents are not responsible for the acts of their children.

There is no evidence they knew the children had trespassed into Farmerâ€™s shed, or that it posed any danger to Farmer, even if they did.

Ken agreed so a contract formed. But the performance of both parties is subject to the condition that Barbie must return with Bunny. If that condition does not hold, the promises each made fail to ripen into contractual duties.

(A) is wrong because it says Farmer will â€œonlyâ€ recover if the lease agreement was in writing, and that is not true as to the $1,800 Tom owes.

Finally, (C) is wrong because Paulâ€™s notice to Thomas on 2/26 that he could not get the paint on time is clearly an anticipatory repudiation, a major breach.

(C) is wrong because even though Hal and Wanda have given Anadarko a license to enter the land (that is what a lease does), that does not excuse Anadarko from performing its duties under the terms of that license. (D) is wrong because bankruptcy does not excuse Anadarko from its obligations. The oil-lease it has purchased from Hal and Wanda would be an asset of Anadarko and it will either sell or retain that asset in bankruptcy. In either case the duties and benefits of the lease will survive bankruptcy unless the asset becomes entirely worthless. (B) is the correct answer because if the government seizes the land Anadarkoâ€™s performance becomes either illegal or impossible or both, the purposes for which the parties entered into the contract will be frustrated, the contract will fail (for failure of an implied material condition), and both parties will be excused from performance.', '2017-10-13 03:44:16', 1, '[\"Hal and Wanda died before the 20- year period ended.\",\"The State of Texas seized the land and everything on it by eminent domain to be part of the Texas Oil Reserve.\",\"Hal and Wanda had given Anadarko a license to enter their land.\",\"Anadarko declared bankruptcy before the lease expired.\"]', 1, 'Subsequent failure of implied condition'),

After Gonsanto delivered 1,000 gallons of Killzitol to Farmer, Congress enacted a law prohibiting the sale of FYB, the main ingredient in Killzitol.

That is what makes them â€œexpressâ€ rather than â€œimpliedâ€. It is simply nonsense to say, â€œThe express conditions implied that...â€ Implied conditions are simply implied by the purposes of the parties and the circumstances within which the contract forms, not the express provisions of the agreement. (B) is correct. The term â€œconstructive conditionâ€ means a condition that is implied by the circumstances of the contract. Usually it means the circumstances imply one party has a duty to perform in some manner before the other party is bound, but it can also mean the circumstances imply some â€œorder of performanceâ€ is necessary to bind a party.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, distinguishing express conditions from covenants, p. 43.] (A) is wrong because the term â€œSatisfaction Guaranteed!â€ does not make â€œpersonal satisfactionâ€ an express material condition of the contract because neither that term nor the circumstances of the contract suggest that Bill ever intended to go unpaid if Homer was dissatisfied.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, waivers of condition, p. 56 and promissory estoppel, p. 96.] (D) is wrong because this is at the discretion of the court, and there is no such thing as â€œlegal estoppelâ€. Estoppel is always an equitable concept. (A) is wrong because if Owen retracts his waiver Bill would be in major breach because use of Standard Brands paint was an express contract condition.

[See â€œSimple Real Property Outlineâ€, priority of mortgage claims, p. 66.] When Bob assigned his claim against the house to Able that gave Able the same claim that was superior to Donâ€™s. The phrase, â€œAble is subrogated to the rights of Bobâ€ in (A) simply means that Bob assigned his rights under the Deed of Trust to Able. That gave Abel the same rights to enforce the Deed of Trust that Bob had, which is the same thing (B) says. Consequently, (A) and (B) say the same thing so neither could be the â€œweakestâ€ argument. Bobâ€™s claim against the house had first priority, so if Able was denied the same priority Charley and Don would reap an unjust enrichment, and that makes (C) a good argument for Able. But when Abel paid off his note it should have discharged his debt, and even if it didnâ€™t that still doesnâ€™t support Ableâ€™s argument his claim is superior to Donâ€™s. So (D) is the lamest argument Able could make, and it is the best answer given the CALL.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, revocation of gratuitous assignments, p. 64.] When irrevocable assignments conflict, the first in time prevails.

She gave up a lease she held on another office and worked for days with Interior Design on the plans for her exciting new office.

When Daddy and Bill agreed to modify the construction it was effectively a modification of their contract so that Bill would do the work differently and in exchange Daddy would waive his rights to demand that the construction do as originally promised. (D) is wrong because that is an exchange of consideration. Nancy is a donee beneficiary, and donee beneficiaries have no legal rights to enforce third-party beneficiary contracts against promisees (Daddy is the promisee of Bill here). Donee beneficiaries can legally enforce contracts against breaching promisors (Bill here). But Bill performed the contract as it had been modified, so he was not in breach. Therefore (C) is wrong as Nancy has no legal cause of action against either Daddy or Bill.

You simply have to eliminate the worst answers, try to narrow your choices down to two possible answers and pick one of them. Here the question asks if Cliff was a third-party beneficiary of Ronâ€™s â€œworkâ€. That must mean â€œcontract with Anneâ€ because the only â€œworkâ€ Ron did that concerned Cliff was under that contract. (A) is wrong because Cliffâ€™s rights under the Anne-Ron agreement do not depend on the Anne-Cliff agreement referred to. And even if the writer of the question meant to say â€œunder the agreement between Anne and Ronâ€ this would still be a wrong answer. (B) is wrong because Cliff could not be a â€œthird-party beneficiaryâ€ of the Anne-Cliff agreement because he is a party to that same contract. (C) is wrong because it does not respond to the CALL. (D) is wrong because Cliff is a third- party beneficiary of the Anne-Ron contract. So all 4 answers are wrong and are going to have to guess which of them was supposed to be the â€œrightâ€ answer before someone at the Bar screwed it up.

(A) is wrong because it suggests Harry might claim he entered into the Tom-Harry contract as a result of a â€œunilateral mistakeâ€ that Tom knew or should have known of. But a claim of â€œunilateral mistakeâ€ is not allowed as a defense when the partiesâ€™ â€œmistakeâ€ is simply about what the properties bought or sold are worth.

Under that modification some unspecified motorcycle dealer was going to benefit, so that unnamed dealer was an intended third-party beneficiary.

Dick offered to carry a second (to loan Tom part of the price as a subordinated claim against the property) for $30,000 at 7%. Tom agreed to that and succeeded in getting a loan for $290,000 at 5.5%. On September 1 Tom tendered payment of $370,000. Dick refused to accept the money.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, laches, p. 100.] (A) is wrong because even though Tom may have been able to have a Court equitably estop Dick from refusing to accept his payment on September 1, Tom took no action at that time. (B) is correct because Tom did not act to seek a remedy against Dick within a reasonable period of time, and for Tom to block the sale to Harry the â€œnext yearâ€ would unjustly prejudice Dickâ€™s position. (C) is correct but it is not the best answer because even though Tom could plea for promissory estoppel, Dick would counter that plea with the defense of laches. (D) is wrong because the oral agreement between Tom and Dick, that Dick would accept less than $400,000, was not in writing, and this was a contract for the sale of land. As a result, the agreement (a modification of their contract) was not legally enforceable, and could only be considered a â€œwaiver of conditionâ€. And waivers of conditions are always revocable at law. So when Dick refused to accept $370,000, he was merely revoking his waiver of the contract condition that Tom could pay $370,000 instead.

Breaching a contract is illegal (that is why the law provides a remedy), and threatening to breach a contract is just as illegal. (B) is wrong because Bill did not raise a â€œgood faith, reasonable contract dispute.â€ (C) is the best answer because Bill cannot win at law in a breach of contract action since the modification was not supported by consideration.

Mowenâ€™s mower broke down and he was not able to finish mowing until Saturday.\r\n\r\nIf Farmer has suffered no damages as a result of the delay but refuses to pay Mowen anyway:', '(C) Answer (A) is wrong because Farmerâ€™s promise to pay was subject to the constructive condition precedent that Mowen had to perform as promised. Mowen did not perform as promised because he was late finishing the job. As a result Mowen was in breach, and Farmerâ€™s promise did not become a duty to pay. Therefore, it is logically impossible for Farmer to be in breach, whether major or minor until and unless it is determined Mowen substantially performed. If he did, the constructive condition would be excused, and Farmerâ€™s promise to pay would ripen into a duty to pay. But that is a fact for the Court to decide, and until it is decided, Farmer cannot be in breach. (B) is wrong because Mowen is the breaching party and as such cannot have suffered any â€œdamagesâ€. (C) is correct because the only possible remedy that can be awarded to a breaching party is restitution. If the breach was minor, the award of a money judgment is legal restitution. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, restitution to breaching party, p. 91.] If a money judgment is awarded to a party that has committed a major breach or for some other reason has no right to a remedy at law, the remedy is equitable restitution.

As a result, when Coats breached the contract, it was a major breach, and he no longer has any legal right to be paid at all.

Dick accepted Tomâ€™s $200,000 bid first, and then Harry accepted Tomâ€™s $300,000 bid. Tom had to decline Harryâ€™s job, so Harry engaged the services of a different contractor. Tom spent $150,000 on labor and materials building Dickâ€™s house. Then Dick repudiated the contract and ordered Tom off his land.

Tom claims expectation damages of $20,000, consequential damages of $30,000, reliance damages of $150,000, and incidental damages of $1,000.

The fact that Tom did not make the profit he â€œexpectedâ€ from entering into a contract with Harry was not caused by Dickâ€™s later breach, so it did not constitute either reliance or consequential damages. As a result, Tomâ€™s total damages caused by the breach were $171,000. But Tom has a right to an award measured by legal restitution, the amount of benefit his efforts conveyed upon Dick. Since the contract amount was $200,000 and Dick only had to spend $25,000 more to complete the house, Tom has conveyed $175,000 in benefits on Dick. (A) is wrong because even though Tomâ€™s damages were $171,000, he has a right to be paid $175,000 in legal restitution.

But the CALL here asks about Tammyâ€™s â€œrightsâ€, and that concerns the remedies she would have at law, not in equity. The contract here cannot be performed within a year from the date of execution because it was created in May, and Tammy was to perform contract duties until the end of May of the next year. So it is not legally enforceable for the entire period specified. But that does not mean it is void entirely. It would not be unenforceable for the period that Tammy has already performed. (A) is not clearly correct because the facts donâ€™t state the contract was in writing. If not, Tammy cannot enforce it or recover damages for the period between the date of termination, December 31, and the end of the promised pay period, May 30.

It had been logged by Pacific since 2000, and that had left the land crisscrossed with logging roads that had seriously eroded the land, filling streams with silt and damaging the environment. In 2005 Pacific offered to pay Bob $30,000 to extend its timber lease on the land for another five years. At Bobâ€™s insistence, Pacific wrote the lease extension agreement to say, â€œPacific agrees to reforest and return the land to its original condition at the conclusion of the lease.â€ Another clause in the contract said, â€œThis is the entire agreement between the parties.â€ When the lease terminated in 2010 Pacific left the land crisscrossed with logging roads, erosion, and streams filled with silt the same as it had been before the 2005 lease extension. Bob asserts that Pacific breached the lease because it had promised to return the land to the â€œoriginal conditionâ€ as it was in 2000.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, four corners doctrine, p. 40.] However, evidence of the past course of dealing between the parties and terms of the trade are always admissible to establish the meaning of contract terms. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, course of dealing and terms of trade, p. 41.] And contracts should be interpreted to give effect to all provisions, if possible. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, resolving contradicting provisions, p. 42.] (D) is wrong because interpretation disputes are not â€œmutual mistakesâ€ that would void all contracts. If it were so, every contract could be voided after the fact by simply disputing the meanings of the words used. (A) is wrong because the term â€œoriginal conditionâ€ has a plain meaning and is not ambiguous in and of itself. (B) is correct because if ambiguous terms in contracts cannot be resolved by extrinsic evidence or other rules of interpretation, they will generally be interpreted against the drafter of the document. Pacific could have written the contract to say â€œoriginal condition at the beginning of the 2005 lease extensionâ€ and it did not. Its failure to expressly state what â€œoriginal conditionâ€ meant created the ambiguity, and it would bear the burden of the result. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, resolution of ambiguity against drafter, p. 42.]', '2017-10-15 14:12:17', 1, '[\"The contract was void from the beginning because the term \\u201coriginal condition\\u201d is fatally ambiguous.\",\"If the meaning of \\u201coriginal condition\\u201d cannot be determined otherwise, Bob would win.\",\"The court would hold for Pacific if the cost of restoring the land to the 2000 condition would exceed the contract amount.\",\"The contract was void from the beginning because there was a mutual mistake about the meaning of the terms.\"]', 1, 'Resolution of ambiguity against drafter, p. 42.'),
(933, 1, 35, '32. White orally agreed to sell her house to Jose for $160,000. Jose was to pay $40,000 down, and the balance of $120,000 was to be paid off over 10 years at $1,000 a month. At the end of that time White promised to give Jose the Deed to the house. Jose paid White $40,000 and took possession of the house. After that Jose paid White $1,000 every month for 10 years, a total of $120,000. At the end of the 10 year period White claimed Jose was just a renter and refused to deliver the Deed to the house.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the most accurate statement?', '(C) The Part Performance Doctrine is broadly adopted law, but States vary widely in their implementation of the concept. It allows a Court to legally enforce an oral agreement for the sale of land in certain circumstances even though the Statute of Frauds has not been satisfied, if the buyer has taken exclusive possession of the land, paid all or almost all of the purchase price or otherwise has made valuable improvements, and the acts of the parties can only be explained by the conclusion that the land was sold under an oral agreement. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, contracts conveying interests in land / part performance doctrine, p. 35.] (A) and (B) are wrong because Jose took exclusive possession, paid the entire sale price, and a mere â€œrenterâ€ would not have paid White $40,000 at the beginning of the transaction. Under these circumstances the Part Performance Doctrine, at least in some States, would give Jose a legal right to the land, and he would not have to depend on an equitable argument. (D) is wrong for the same reason. Detrimental reliance is an equitable argument and the Part Performance Doctrine, at least when adopted by statute, provides legal rights. (C) is correct because the beginning payment of $40,000 cannot be explained by any conclusion except that Jose was buying and not just renting the land.', '2017-10-15 14:15:17', 1, '[\" Jose has no legal right to title.\",\"A court of equity can enforce the oral agreement.\",\"Jose has a legal right to take title in many jurisdictions because a renter would not have made the $40,000 down payment.\",\"Jose has a right to a remedy if he detrimentally relied on White\\u2019s promise.\"]', 2, 'Contracts conveying interests in land / part performance doctrine, p. 35.'),
(934, 1, 35, '33. Max agreed to paint Samâ€™s house with Dunn- Edwards paint for $3,000. When Max was almost done with the painting Sam noticed Max was using Kelly-Moore paint instead of Dunn- Edwards. Uncertain about what to do, Sam remained silent as Max finished the job and began packing up his tools. Finally Sam said, â€œGee, Max, you were supposed to use Dunn- Edwards paint and used Kelly-Moore instead.â€ Max responded, â€œYeah. This Kelly-Moore is just as good and I got a better price on it.â€ Sam refused to pay Max.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the most accurate statement?', '(A) If contract parties become aware other parties have committed major breaches and allow the breaching parties to continue performance they are deemed to have â€œwaived the breachâ€ by â€œelectingâ€ to treat them as minor, not major breaches. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, waiver of major breach, p. 78.] Consequently, if the performing parties otherwise are found to have substantially performed, constructive conditions will be excused and the non-breaching parties promise to pay for performance will ripen into a duty to pay, with an offset for damages caused by the breaches of the performing parties. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, restitution to breaching party, p. 91.] (B) and (C) are wrong because Sam allowed Max to continue performance after discovering he had violated an express condition of the contract. That â€œwaived the breachâ€ and left Max with a legal right to be paid. (D) is wrong because Samâ€™s promise to pay Max was subject to the constructive condition that Max had to perform as promised. He did not, and because of that breach Samâ€™s promise to pay him never ripened into a duty to pay. Consequently, it was logically impossible for Sam to breach the contract at all. (A) is correct because Max would be held to have substantially performed, and that will excuse the constructive conditions leaving Sam with a duty to pay him the contract price less any damages caused by the breach. If Sam cannot prove there is any difference in the quality of the two paints he must pay Max $3,000.', '2017-10-15 14:18:55', 1, '[\"Sam must pay Max $3,000 if he cannot prove Kelly-Moore paint is not as good as Dunn-Edwards paint.\",\"Max breached an express condition of the contract and has no legal right to be paid.\",\"Max\\u2019s only remedy is to seek equitable restitution.\",\"Sam has committed a major breach of contract by refusing to pay Max.\"]', 0, 'Waiver of major breach, p. 78.');
