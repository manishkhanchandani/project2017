There was no legal effect as to the woman\'s exclamation because there was no binding contract here. A binding contract requires, there to have been an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Here, the boss\' statement that he would pay the woman $500 a month for the rest of her life could be considered a valid offer because it indicated an intent to be bound, had definite and certain terms, and was communicated to the woman.

For the defendant to be found guilty of manslaughter, a proximate cause between the illegal act and the resulting death of the victim must exist. This causation must be more than simple cause-in-fact; it must be somehow foreseeable from the illegal action taken. In this case, the fact the defendant did not possess a valid license was not a causal factor in the death of the child.\r\n\r\n Answer A is incorrect. The common law misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, while permitting the prosecution of involuntary manslaughter for misdemeanor offenses, still requires that there be a proximate cause between the illegal action and death. Answer B is incorrect. While the licensing requirements may be to protect life, criminal liability for manslaughter requires more than simple negligence, but also proximate cause. Finally, answer D is incorrect; manslaughter does not require that the defendant have any criminal intent to commit an offense. Recklessness is sufficient.

Answer B is incorrect because the businessman did not need to appreciate the risk he was creating to be found guilty of manslaughter. In addition, his voluntary intoxication was one of the reasons for his recklessness and will not serve as a defense. Answer C is incorrect because a proper claim of self-defense does not require that the person actually be in danger, but rather that the person reasonably believe he is in danger, even if it is not true.

Common law murder is not a specific intent crime. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied by actions that show a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. In this case, the woman\'s act of firing an automatic weapon in a populated bank demonstrates the reckless indifference necessary to show malice aforethought, and the woman can be convicted of murder. The woman was acting with gross recklessness toward human life and thus with malice aforethought.

The defendant\'s best defense to a charge of second degree murder is that he was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was insane at the time of the killing.  The defendant would qualify as insane under the <i> M\'Naghten </i> rule, because his delusions caused him to believe that his actions were not criminal as he was acting properly in self-defense.  Likewise, under the <i> Durham</i> test, the defendant would qualify for the insanity defense because his crime was a product of his mental defect.  It is unclear if the defendant would qualify as insane under the irresistible impulse test because it is unspecified whether the defendant was unable to control his actions or to conform his conduct to the law.

The lawyer replied that her usual charge was $100 per hour, and estimated that the legal work on behalf of the client would cost about $5,000 at that rate. The client said, \"Okay, let\'s proceed with it,\" and the lawyer timely and successfully completed the work. Because of unexpected title problems, the lawyer reasonably spent 75 hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed the client a bill for $7,500, with a letter itemizing the work performed and time spent. The client responded by a letter expressing his good-faith belief that the lawyer had agreed to a total fee of no more than $5,000. The client enclosed a check in the amount of $5,000 payable to the lawyer and conspicuously marked, \"Payment in full for legal service in connection with the sale of the client\'s building.\" Despite reading the \"Payment in full. . .\" language, the lawyer, without any notation of protest or reservation of rights, endorsed and deposited the check to her bank account. The check was duly paid by the client\'s bank. A few days later, the lawyer unsuccessfully demanded payment from the client of the $2,500 difference between the amount of her bill and the check, and now sues the client for that difference.\r\n\r\nWhat, if anything, can the lawyer recover from the client?', 'Answer B is correct. Under rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked \"payment in full.\" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Although mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord, consideration is furnished where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Even if the client lacked sufficient legal basis to prevail on his claim, his good-faith belief in the validity of the claim makes his promise to settle sufficient consideration to support the modification. Therefore, when the lawyer read the \"payment in full\" language on the client\'s $5,000 check and then cashed it without protest, the lawyer accepted the accord and satisfaction of the debt.

The toy company exercised no control over the actual design of the game; its only duties were to make the game according to the engineer\'s specifications and market it. A finding that the toy company was liable based on the engineer\'s defective design was a finding that the toy company was not an active wrongdoer.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect as this is not a joint enterprise issue because it can be established which individual caused the injury.

Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time.\" Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December. The final week\'s delay was caused by the photographer\'s not being notified promptly by the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm\'s length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, \"The photograph makes me look too old.

Where the existence of a particular person is necessary for the performance of a duty, his incapacity, if sufficient to make performance impracticable, may operate to excuse performance of the contract. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties\' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of \"[the customer] and his family,\" the customer\'s availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer\'s duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer\'s delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer\'s recovery, his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct (informing the photographer to \"take the photograph anyway\") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline.

The mother was not a party to the contract between the sister and the brother, so the only way for her to have contractual rights is if she was the intended beneficiary of the contract. For the mother to be an intended beneficiary, she must be the person to whom performance is to be given. In this case several factors indicate that the mother is an intended beneficiary: the mother is named in the contract, the mother directly receives the payments, and the mother has a close familial relationship with the parties. Therefore, the mother is an intended beneficiary and will prevail in a suit against the brother for the $500 payment.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because modern contract law is based upon the objective test, which does not consider a party\'s private intent. The brother\'s intent is irrelevant. Further, whether a contract was formed is not at issue.

With respect to an invitee, a business has a duty to make a reasonable inspection and a duty to warn of, or repair, known hazards on the premises. The duty to protect applies to defects that are: (1) known to the business, (2) dangerous, and (3) non-obvious to the invitee. This liability may be abated if the invitee became a trespasser by entering an area that was restricted and off-limits to visitors. If a customer wanders into an off-limits area, the only duty the business owes is to refrain from willful and wanton conduct.\r\n\r\nThe first issue in this question is the customer\'s status. The facts state that the customer went into an \"Employees Only\" area. However, an employee observed the plaintiff and allowed the entry. Therefore, the plaintiff is not a trespasser in this situation, but an invitee. Thus, A and B are incorrect. The second issue is whether the hazard was open and obvious, thus abating the drug store\'s liability. Choice D appropriately addresses the issue that the clerk had a duty to warn the plaintiff of the danger if he had reason to believe that the plaintiff was unaware of the open shaft.

Even if bowling were inherently dangerous, that characterization would support an argument for permitting recreational participants who appreciate the risks of the activity to assume the risks by signing a waiver rather than constituting a reason for ignoring the waiver. \r\n\r\nB is correct. Waivers are most easily justified when an activity poses inherent risks that are familiar to the participants and cannot be entirely eliminated without removing the pleasure from the activity. The risk that materialized here is not inherent to bowling but could arise whenever someone is careless while holding a heavy object. A court might find that it is against public policy to permit individuals or businesses to insulate themselves from the deterrent incentives provided by the threat of negligence liability. For that reason, the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and could hold the waiver ineffective. \r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Although the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and therefore hold the waiver to be no bar when the harm was due to the instructor\'s negligence, asking the woman to sign the waiver was not in itself negligent or unreasonable.

The nephew, hoping to collect his inheritance, intentionally caused the death of the man, and should be found guilty of criminal homicide. The issue in this question is what actions are sufficient to be considered as \"causing\" the death of another. The actions must be an actual and proximate cause of the victim\'s death, but they need not be the sole cause of death. In this case, the man was poisoned by his nephew, which weakened the man\'s heart, and eventually lead to his death, and is thus sufficient causation to sustain a homicide charge.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. The fact that a victim may have died in another manner if the defendant\'s actions were not taken is not a defense to a homicide charge.

The nephew\'s poisoning shortened the man\'s life, and the fact that the man may have died from a fatal illness, while it shows the nephew isn\'t so smart, does not serve as a defense to the charge of murder. The facts given show that the poison did weaken the man\'s heart, leading to the heart attack. Answer D is incorrect.

The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender\'s best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor\'s age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law. Because the bartender did not knowingly sell alcohol to the minor, he should be acquitted.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the fact that the purchaser could have presented a fake identification does not excuse the bartender\'s not asking to see it; his only legitimate excuse would be that he believed the person to be over 21 and that the statute includes a mens rea requirement. Answer B is incorrect because ignorance of the law is generally not an excuse, and the bartender\'s not being told that he has to check identification does not affect the offense\'s mens rea requirement. When a crime requires that the defendant act knowingly, he must have been aware that his conduct was of a particular nature, or at least know that his conduct will necessarily or very likely cause a particular result. Here, he must have been aware of the fact that he was selling to a minor, or to someone between the ages of 18 and 21, not the fact that his conduct was violating that regulation.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, again, ignorance of the law is no excuse, and not knowing that beer is an alcoholic beverage does not excuse the bartender\'s actions.

The child\'s death was the result, not of malice aforethought, but of criminal negligence on the part of the father. Failure to seek medical attention for an illness is generally insufficient for the finding of malice aforethought, so the father, in his criminal negligence, has committed involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because murder, at common law, requires that the killing be done with malice aforethought. Because the death resulted from an untreated illness, and there was no evidence that the father acted with either actual or implied malice toward his child, he is not guilty of murder. Answer C is incorrect because a person is only guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he successfully raises a heat of passion defense to a murder charge. There was no heat of passion defense raised, and, combined with a lack of evidence that the father intended his child to die, he cannot properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

The defendant\'s best argument for being found not guilty of felony murder is that he is not responsible for the customer\'s actions in shooting the clerk. The courts are split regarding whether a defendant is liable for felony murder when the death is caused by a third party. Under the proximate cause theory, a defendant can be liable where the innocent party is killed as the result of resistance from the victim or police. However, under the agency theory, the defendant will only be found liable for felony murder when someone is killed by a person acting as an accomplice of the defendant. Given that the customer is neither a victim nor the police, and that the customer is not an agent or an accomplice of the defendant, the defendant\'s best argument is that he is not responsible for the customer\'s actions. Therefore, answer D provides the best possible defense.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because felony murder does not require that the defendant have the specific intent to kill the clerk. It is sufficient that the underlying felony was dangerous and that the killing was foreseeable.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect because attempted robbery, even with a toy gun, is still dangerous enough to be considered a proper underlying felony for felony murder. Arguing that he did not actually complete the robbery is not the defendant\'s best argument for acquittal.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, once again, the defendant\'s intent to create a risk of harm is irrelevant under felony murder. Regardless of his intent that nobody get hurt, he did create a situation by committing a dangerous felony, and, if he bore criminal responsibility for the actor who did the killing, he would be found guilty.

To be guilty as an accomplice, the alleged accomplice must give aid, counsel, or encouragement to the principal with the intent to encourage the crime.

(105, 1, 19, 'The defendant, a worker in a metal working shop, had long been teasing a young colleague by calling him insulting names and ridiculing him. One day the colleague responded to the teasing by picking up a metal bar and attacking the defendant. The defendant could have escaped from the shop. Instead, he parried the blow with his left arm, and with his right hand struck the colleague on his jaw. The colleague died as a result of his injuries.\r\n\r\nCan the defendant be properly convicted of an offense?', 'The correct answer is D. When the defendant parried the colleague\'s blow and struck the colleague on the jaw, he was acting in self-defense and should not be convicted of any offense. A person can properly claim self-defense if the action taken is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent harm to himself from the use of unlawful force. In this case, the force the defendant used, a blow to the head, was reasonable in light of the attack on him by the colleague with a metal bar. Although he likely could have escaped the situation, the defendant was not required to retreat before using reasonable force for the situation. Finally, although generally the initial aggressor is not allowed to claim self-defense, in this question the defendant started by using words and not a physical attack. The colleague then responded unreasonably with deadly force. The defendant, then, although the initial aggressor, was able to respond in turn with deadly force. The defendant therefore has a proper claim to self-defense and should not be convicted of any crime. Thus, A and B are incorrect.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Here, the defendant intended to harm the colleague when he struck him in the jaw. He did intend to inflict great bodily injury when he responded to the colleague\'s attack on him.

The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a party who is subject to the condition, unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party.

However, the blade that was on the saw he picked out had very coarse teeth for cutting rough lumber. The purchaser told the storekeeper that he wanted a saw blade that would cut plywood. The storekeeper exchanged the coarse blade for a new one with finer teeth that would cut plywood smoothly. The new blade was manufactured by Saw-Blade Company, which uses all available techniques to inspect its products for defects. The reconditioned saw had been manufactured by Power Saw Company.\r\n\r\nThe week after the saw was purchased, the employee, who works for the purchaser in the purchaser\'s cabinet-making shop, was injured while using the saw.

Strict liability can be imposed upon the storekeeper for the sale of any product which is in a defective condition or unreasonably dangerous to the user. Liability for physical harm to the employee is available provided that: (1) the storekeeper is engaged in the business of selling reconditioned power saws, and (2) the power saw was not substantially changed by anyone else before the employee used it.

The storekeeper made no express representation to the purchaser or the employee about the power saw.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Res ipsa loquitur generally requires that the instrumentality that caused the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant.

On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler\'s assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender.\r\n\r\nWas the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?', 'Answer B is correct. UCC Â§ 2-612(2) provides that a buyer may reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. The delivery of less than the contracted-for amount constituted a nonconformity that substantially impaired the value of the installment since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs, and the bakery was entitled to reject the tender.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, but that rule is inapplicable to assess the conformance of a seller\'s performance under an installment contract. Because this is an installment contract, the substantial impairment standard governs the buyer\'s right to reject, and the bakery is entitled to reject under that standard. Under the substantial impairment standard, an installment can be rejected by the buyer only if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured. Furthermore, the whole contract is breached if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of the entire contract.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. UCC Â§ 2-612(2) provides that a buyer is entitled to reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. A buyer\'s right to reject a particular installment is not dependent on a substantial impairment of the entire contract. Moreover, in this case, the wholesaler\'s assurance of cure was inadequate since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. As stated above, a buyer\'s right to reject a delivery on an installment contract for the sale of goods is not governed by the perfect tender rule, but rather by the substantial impairment standard. Here, the bakery had the right to reject the second installment because the missing 5,000 pounds of flour could not be delivered for several days, substantially impairing the installment.

The facts indicate that the stove arrived exactly as it was designed. This is a defective design case.

A prisoner, who was imprisoned for a technical violation of a regulatory statute, happened to be standing next to the mobster when the photograph was taken.\r\n\r\nWhen the picture appeared in the press, the prisoner suffered severe emotional distress because he believed that his business associates and friends would think he was consorting with gangsters.

The prisoner brought an action against the photographer for intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best argument that the photographer can make in support of a motion for summary judgment?', 'D is the correct answer. A motion for summary judgmentwill be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For the prisoner to prevail in his claim for intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress, he must show that: (1) the photographer\'s intentional (with purpose or knowledge to a substantial certainty) or reckless disregard for the consequences of publishing the photograph was (2) extreme and outrageous conduct, which (3) caused the prisoner severe emotional distress. Thus B is incorrect because severe emotional distress can be evidenced physically, but physical harm is not required. The photographer clearly pointed his lens to take a picture, knowing to a substantial certainty that the mobster and his companions would be photographed as a result, so choice A will not help the photographer.

The driver of the car brought a strict liability action against the owner of the plant to recover for the damage to the car. \r\n\r\nIs the driver likely to prevail?', 'Answer A is correct. Although the manufacture of explosives may be an abnormally dangerous activity, strict liability for injuries caused by such activities is limited to the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. This accident could have occurred when a roof tile fell from a building that housed a perfectly safe and ordinary activity. The owner may, however, be liable for negligence. Thus, Answer A is correct and Answer C is incorrect. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the driver is not likely to prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The fact that the windstorm was unusually severe may be relevant to a negligence claim, where the case would turn on whether the owner took reasonable precautions to prevent the accident, but it is not relevant to a claim of strict liability. The strict liability claim fails because the risk that materialized was not of the sort that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Strict liability is based on the abnormally dangerous nature of the activity and is limited to the realization of the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. The inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on may be one factor in deciding whether the activity is abnormally dangerous, but it is not the only factor.

He often placed merchandise on the sidewalk, sometimes for short intervals, sometimes from 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Pedestrians from time to time stopped and gathered to look at the merchandise. A man had moved into an apartment which was situated immediately above the store; a street-level stairway entrance was located about twenty feet to the east. On several occasions, the man had complained to the store owner about the situation because not only were his view and peace of mind affected, but his travel on the sidewalk was made more difficult. The man owned and managed a restaurant two blocks to the west of his apartment and made frequent trips back and forth. There was a back entrance to his apartment through a parking lot; this entrance was about two hundred feet farther in walking distance from his restaurant. Once the man complained to the police, whereupon the store owner was arrested under a local ordinance which prohibited the placing of goods or merchandise on public sidewalks and imposed, as its sole sanction, a fine for its violation.\r\n\r\nOne day, the sidewalk in front of the store owner\'s store was unusually cluttered because he was cleaning and mopping the floor of his shop.

Although public nuisances generally must be prosecuted by public authorities, a public nuisance action by a private party is possible if the public nuisance causes a unique harm to the plaintiff that differs from the general harm to the public. The remedy for the public nuisance is usually damages. In this case, the man is asking for injunctive relief, which only is granted where damages are an unavailable or inadequate remedy. Since the man has alleged no injury for which damages (compensation for the injuries and a fine) would be inadequate, an injunction would probably be denied. Therefore, D provides the best defense for the store owner.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. A claim for nuisance does not have to be mitigated by removal, and remaining in proximity to the nuisance is not implied consent.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The issue is whether the interference with the safety and property rights of the community was unreasonable, not whether the violation of the ordinance was reasonable.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect as there is no remedy of self-help available to the man.

Any duty that the landlord may have is at most a duty to act reasonably.

The possessor of a vicious dog may be strictly liable to those injured by the dog, but the landlord here is not in possession of the dog. Moreover, the liability, where it exists, is limited to cases in which the possessor has reason to know that the dog is unusually dangerous. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. A landlord may have a nondelegable duty to protect persons who come upon the land from dangerous conditions of the property, such as cracked walks and broken stairs, but the presence of a dog that belongs to a tenant is not such a condition.

Because the sports car performed exactly as it was designed to perform, this is a defective design case. For strict liability to apply in defective design, the driver must prevail in a risk-utility balancing test where she must show that the risk and severity of her injuries were predictable to her as the driver of the sports car. In some jurisdictions, the court would then consider the feasibility of alternative designs. Other jurisdictions shift the burden to the defendant (once plaintiff proves causation) requiring the manufacturer to show that the utility of the design outweighs the inherent danger. The driver provided evidence that an alternative engine design of equal cost and performance was possible without the stalling flaw. Under the facts, the judge could find that the driver met her burden to show injury to herself as the result of a design flaw that was not technologically and economically burdensome for Rapido Company to correct. A directed verdict (also called Judgment as a Matter of Law) allows judgment if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that a reasonable person/jury could not disagree.

The airline company sued the delivery service based on a theory of the tortious interference with its contract. The tort of interference with contract provides a cause of action against those who improperly interfere with the performance of a contract between the plaintiff and a third person.

The proper defendant in the tort action would be the food company. See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 766. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the airline will not prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The airline could sue the food company for tortious interference even though it was not in privity with the food company, but it did not do so. It sued the delivery service instead.

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not.

As a result of the impact the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian\'s grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nA pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver\'s attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian\'s attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver\'s license expired two years prior to the collision.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the driver to have a valid driver\'s license has which of the following effects?', 'B is correct. In a negligence case, a plaintiff must establish that a duty of care was owed and that a breach of that duty occurred. Typically these elements are analyzed through common law principles. In some instances a statute may provide for the standard of care which should be used instead of the default common law duty. For a statutory standard of care to exist, two things must be true: (i) the harm that occurred was the type of harm that the statute was designed to protect against, and (ii) the plaintiff was of the class of people that the statute was designed to protect. If a statutory duty of care exists, then a violation of the statute would satisfy the elements of duty and breach in a negligence case. Courts sometimes call this negligence per se. Negligence per se, however, does not automatically furnish liability for negligence because the remaining elements of causation and damages must also be proven by the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nA majority of courts have held that a violation of a licensing statute does not constitute negligence per se. The courts have reasoned that unlicensed driving is not equivalent to negligent driving. The purpose of a driver\'s license is for registration and identification of drivers. The licensing statute was not designed to prevent pedestrians in crosswalks from being hit by licensed drivers. Therefore, violation of the statute would not establish negligence per se and would not furnish a basis for liability. Likewise, the lack of a license does not establish incompetence, so C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA and D are incorrect. Violation of a safety statute can be held as negligence per se, but lack of a license is not a safety statute violation, nor does it create trespasser status in the unlicensed driver.

The gun cabinet was normally locked. The grandmother had opened it for dusting several days before the boys\' visit, and had then forgotten to relock it. She was not aware that it was unlocked when the boys arrived. \r\n\r\nAt the trial on an action against a grandmother on behalf of the friend, the information above has been admitted into evidence.

A directed verdict (also called Judgment as a Matter of Law) allows judgment if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that a reasonable person/jury could not disagree. A directed verdict is entered at the close of the evidence before the matter goes to a jury. There are two potential claims at issue in this question. The first is whether the grandmother can be held vicariously liable for the grandson\'s tortious act. The grandmother has a duty to exercise reasonable care in the control of the grandson while he is physically within her care or custody. Liability, however, is generally limited to actions that were a known propensity of the child, and thus, foreseeable by the caretaker. A custodian of a child who fails to exercise control regarding the known propensity of that child is generally not vicariously liable for the child\'s tortious behavior; rather the caretaker is liable for his or her own negligence in failing to control the child. The facts clearly indicate that the grandson\'s behavior was not foreseeable to the grandmother.\r\n\r\nThe second issue, however, is whether the grandmother had a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff to take affirmative measures that would keep her grandson from using the gun. When the grandmother failed to remove the bullets from a stored gun and then forgot to relock the gun case, it was foreseeable that her grandson would find and play with the gun; she thereby failed in her duty to control the grandson\'s use of a dangerous instrumentality.\r\n\r\nA is the wrong conclusion. While the grandmother may not generally be liable for her grandson\'s tortious activities, she is liable for her own negligence.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect.

Trespass is the physical invasion of the real property of another, the intent to bring about that invasion, and causation. Intent refers only to the intent to enter the land; the defendant need not know that the land belongs to the plaintiff. Therefore, if the defendant intentionally drove his car onto the plaintiff\'s land, this would provide a sufficient basis for a trespass claim.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect.

Any user who is injured by a defective product can bring a products liability claim based on strict liability in tort as long as they can satisfy the requirements for the prima facie case. The four elements of the case are: (1) a strict duty owed by a commercial supplier, (2) breach of that duty, (3) actual and proximate causation, and (4) damages. In a products liability claim, the main difference between a negligence and strict liability claim is that the negligence standard of care is replaced with an absolute duty to make safe. In a strict liability case, the plaintiff need only prove that the product was unreasonably dangerous to show a breach of duty. Thus, in contrast to a negligence action, a retailer in a strict liability action may be liable simply because it was a commercial supplier of a defective product.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in a strict liability claim, the product must be expected to, and must in fact, reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is supplied. In this case, since the college student removed and disposed of the box containing the adequate warning before the shampoo reached the roommate, the product was substantially changed from the condition in which it was sold, and there is not adequate causation to sustain the roommate\'s claim.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The roommate\'s misuse of the product would not provide a defense to a strict liability action in a jurisdiction that maintains traditional contributory negligence rules. Even if the misuse rose to the level that the roommate was contributorily negligent, this is not a defense where the plaintiff simply failed to recognize the danger or guard against its existence. Therefore, B is also incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because privity is not required in a products liability claim based on strict liability, the injured party must only be a foreseeable user.

The rule of joint and several liability has been retained.\r\n\r\nThe jury has found that the plaintiff sustained damages in the amount of $100,000, and apportioned the causal negligence of the parties as follows: The plaintiff 40%, D-1 30%, and D-2 30%.\r\n\r\nHow much, if anything, can the plaintiff collect from D-1, and how much, if anything, can D-1 then collect from D-2 in contribution?', 'D is the correct calculation. Pure comparative negligence allows recovery by the plaintiff for all damages not attributed to his own negligence. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to $60,000, which is the $100,000 in damages he suffered minus his 40% of the fault. Since this is a joint and several liability jurisdiction, the defendants are each liable for the entire award. The plaintiff can collect the full amount of his award from either defendant or both, as long as the total only equals the $60,000 he is entitled to. The facts indicate that the jurisdiction allows contribution based on proportionate fault. The question asks how much (what is the most) the plaintiff can collect from D-1. Under joint and several liability, the plaintiff can collect up to his full award, here $60,000, from D-1. D-1 can then collect D-2\'s proportionate amount of the award in contribution, which is 30% of $100,000, or $30,000.

The police said that the woman was approximately 75 years old, had white hair, and drove a vintage, cream-colored Ford Thunderbird. Attendants were advised to call the police if they saw her, but to not attempt to apprehend her. Armed robbery is a felony under state law.\r\n\r\nA traveler was passing through the city on a cross-country journey. The traveler was a 75-year-old woman who had white hair and drove a vintage, cream-colored Ford Thunderbird. When the traveler drove into a gas station, the owner of the station thought the traveler must be the robber wanted by the police. After checking the oil at the traveler\'s request, the owner falsely informed the traveler that she had a broken fan belt, that her car could not be driven without a new belt, that it would take him about an hour to replace it, and that she should stay in his office for consultation about the repair. The traveler was greatly annoyed that her journey was delayed, but she stayed in the owner\'s office while she waited for her car. The owner telephoned the police and, within the hour, the police came and questioned the traveler. The police immediately determined that the traveler was not the woman, and the traveler resumed her journey without further delay.\r\n\r\nIn the traveler\'s action for false imprisonment against the owner, the traveler will', 'A is the correct answer. False imprisonment occurs when the plaintiff is confined against her will and is aware of the confinement, or has suffered actual injury. Here, the traveler was not confined to the office but was confined to the gas station premises through the owner\'s misrepresentation of fact. Actual injury is not required if the plaintiff was aware of her confinement. Thus B can be eliminated.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of legal justification. In this case, the owner is protected by the privilege of arrest. For a private citizen to make an arrest without a warrant when a felony has occurred, two things must be true: (i) a felony must have in fact been committed, and (ii) the private citizen must have reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested did commit the felony. The privilege is also limited by three factors: the amount of time of the detention, the amount of force used to detain, and the means of restraint must all be found reasonable. A is the correct answer because a felony has actually occurred, and the owner did reasonably believe that the traveler committed it. Therefore, he was legally justified in the detention of the traveler by the privilege of arrest.\r\n\r\nC and D are incorrect because any claim the traveler may have of false imprisonment would be beat out by the owner\'s privilege of arrest.', '2017-09-17 08:05:24', 1, '[\"not prevail, because the owner reasonably believed that the traveler was the wanted woman.\",\"not prevail, because the traveler suffered no physical or mental harm.\",\"prevail, because the traveler reasonably believed she could not leave the owner\'s premises.\",\"prevail, because the owner lied to the traveler about the condition of her car.\"]', 0, 'Intentional Torts'),

A guest of the hotel fell into the excavation, which the contractor had negligently left unguarded.\r\n\r\nIn an action by the guest against the hotel to recover for his injuries, what would be the most likely outcome?', 'Answer A is correct. Ordinarily, someone who hires an independent contractor would not be vicariously liable for the contractor\'s negligence. However, a landowner who holds his land open to the public has a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business visitors. Such a landowner is liable for any negligence that causes a guest to be injured by unsafe conditions on the premises, even the negligence of an independent contractor.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. While it is true that the hotel would most likely be liable, the contract between the hotel and the contractor is irrelevant to the hotel\'s potential liability to the guest. Should the guest successfully sue the hotel, the contract would allow the hotel to bring an action for indemnification against the contractor, but the contract does not affect the hotel\'s liability to its guests. The hotel\'s liability, as stated above, would arise from its nondelegable duty to the guest to keep a safe premises.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect.

If the hotel had not exercised reasonable care in selecting a contractor, that would be an alternative basis for imposing liability on the hotel.

He intended to come back and get the ladder the next morning. At that time, the homeowner and her family were away on a trip. During the night, a thief, using the ladder to gain access to an upstairs window, entered the house and stole some valuable jewels. The homeowner has asserted a claim against the roofer for damages for the loss of the jewels.\r\n\r\nIn her claim against the roofer, will the homeowner prevail?', 'B is correct. Generally an intentional tort, such as theft, is a superseding action that cuts off liability in a negligence analysis, unless the negligent act\'s foreseeable consequences include the same type of intentional or criminal acts. The ladder was left upright against a home where the family was away on a trip, in plain view for any thief to see. The roofer had a duty of ordinary care to remove his equipment, and it was certainly foreseeable that leaving the ladder at an unoccupied home would potentially result in its use as the instrumentality for a break-in. The burden to remove the ladder was slight compared to the potential severity of the harm. Because the roofer created a foreseeable risk, his liability is not cut off by the thief\'s intentional intervening act. Therefore, C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The roofer did not become a trespasser by leaving the ladder on the owner\'s property. His license to be on the property did not expire until his job was completed, which would include removal of his equipment. Thus, the issue of whether the roofer has a trespasser\'s liability for any damage caused to the owner\'s property does not apply.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect. This answer choice is meant to distract and confuse. This is not a contracts issue. The contract involved the making of repairs to the roof.

In an action brought by the customer against the store, these are the only facts in evidence.\r\n\r\nShould the trial judge permit the case to go to the jury?', 'Answer B is correct. Unlike slip-and-fall cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana peel does not indicate that it has been on the ground for any significant period of time. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support a jury verdict that the store staff was negligent in failing to remove it before the customer\'s fall.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the judge should not let the case go to the jury, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. In slip-and-fall cases, even if a customer was negligent, he could recover some of his damages under a system of pure comparative negligence if a jury determines that the grocer was also negligent. The case at issue, however, should not go to the jury, because there is no evidence to support a finding of negligence on the part of store staff, as explained above.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Strict products liability is not applicable here because the banana was not defective. Moreover, the case at issue should not go to the jury, because there is no evidence to support a finding of negligence on the part of store staff. The fact that the peel came from a banana offered for sale by the grocer is not evidence of negligence. Unlike cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana in the present case indicates that it had not been on the floor for a significant amount of time. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support a jury verdict that the store staff was negligent in failing to remove it before the customer\'s fall.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Foreseeability alone is not sufficient to establish that the grocer was negligent. The plaintiff must also offer evidence that the grocer fell below the standard of care, i.e., that he failed to adopt the precautions that a reasonably prudent person in his situation would adopt to avoid the foreseeable risk. There is no such evidence here.

Generally, there is no affirmative duty to act. However, four exceptions exist: (i) if the defendant voluntarily assumes a duty, (ii) if the peril was caused by the defendant\'s own conduct, (iii) if a special relationship exists between the parties; and (iv) if the defendant has a duty to control a third party. A person assumes a duty to act by voluntarily beginning to aid someone in peril. Once aid has begun, the actor has a duty to use reasonable care in continuing to administer aid. Here A is incorrect because there is no general duty to act to help a stranger, and there has been no assumption of duty either.\r\n\r\nB and C are also incorrect because, although there is a duty to act within a special relationship, neighbor and cousin generally do not fall within the category unless especially close or special for an additional reason. Common examples of special relationships that owe a duty of care are parent-child, employer-employee, common carriers and innkeepers, and parties in privity such as through contract.\r\n\r\nD is the correct answer because the defendant\'s own conduct gave rise to the situation of peril, creating an affirmative duty to aid or assist.

The seller had a duty of reasonable care for the safety of those outside the land to prevent harm resulting from conditions on the land. The facts indicate that ordinary windstorms had previously caused tile loss. Despite the fact that the seller just sold the home, he was or should have been aware of the dangerous condition of the roof and the foreseeability of harm to persons outside the premises from windswept falling tiles. Instead, he left the dangerous conditions without taking precautionary measures to protect against dislodged tiles. It is irrelevant that the seller was no longer the owner or occupier of the house; the seller\'s negligent conduct was a breach of his duty of care and proximately caused the pedestrian\'s injuries, thus choice C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. This is not a products liability issue; it is a failure to exercise reasonable care issue. The seller was a negligent user/owner of a property, not a manufacturer of a defective product. Thus, the pedestrian must assert a claim for negligence, not strict liability. The seller is still liable for his own negligent conduct as it affected the house, even if he has just sold the property at issue.

A private nuisance is substantial and unreasonable interference with a possessor\'s use or enjoyment of his property.

In making this determination, the court will consider the neighborhood, land value, and alternative courses of conduct for the defendant.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the interference is unreasonable because the injury outweighs the utility of the feed lot. Due to the growth of the city, there are now a substantial number of residences near the feed lot. Furthermore, while the cattle company\'s land is worth $300,000, the company has only invested $25,000 in the establishment of the feed lot, and is severely impairing the use of between $125,000 to $200,000 worth of residential property.

While the rancher\'s belief that deadly force was necessary to protect himself from harm may have been actual, it was not reasonable. To justify the use of force sufficient to cause death or serious bodily injury, a defendant must have more than a subjective suspicion that such force is necessary. A defendant must have an actual and reasonable belief that he himself is threatened with force of that sort. In this case, the rancher\'s belief that the neighbor was armed was not reasonable, nor did he have a reasonable belief that the neighbor meant to harm him. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer B is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The majority of states that recognize a right to stand one\'s ground rather than retreat limit the right to an owner who is confronted in his home, not one simply standing outside on land that he owns. Also, even if the rancher had no obligation to retreat, he used deadly force, which was not justifiable unless he had a reasonable belief that he himself was threatened with that degree of force and needed to use deadly force to defend himself. The disparity in numbers here, as well as the fact that the rancher\'s belief that the defendant was armed was not supported by any evidence, indicate that his decision to shoot was unreasonable.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. It is true that force sufficient to cause serious bodily injury cannot be used to protect property, but a property dispute can escalate to a situation in which the participants are in danger of bodily harm. In this case, the rancher will argue that he feared that the neighbor was going to shoot him.

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car was driven by a driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. The pedestrian had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0.02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian\'s grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver\'s attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian\'s attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver\'s license expired two years prior to the collision.\r\n\r\nThe violation of the crosswalk statute by the pedestrian should not defeat her cause of action against the driver because', 'D is the correct answer. The question instructs an analysis based on the use of a safety statute. To determine why the pedestrian should prevail in her cause of action despite her violation of the crosswalk statute, look to the rule. Safety statutes are used only if the statute violated was designed to protect the particular class of foreseeable victim that the plaintiff belonged to, and the harm the plaintiff suffered was the type that the statute was designed to protect.

A person has the privilege to use deadly force in self-defense only if he reasonably believes that he is in danger of serious bodily harm. The facts state that the robber shot his gun at the guard. The guard was therefore privileged to use the force that appeared necessary to prevent the harm, in this case returning fire.

Transferred privilege applies as a defense when, in the reasonable exercise of self-defense by the defendant, a third party is accidentally injured.

B is incorrect because although there was transferred intent, the guard\'s actions are protected by the privilege of self-defense.

The fact that the replacement may have been a better actress suggests that any breach by the original actress was partial because the agent was easily made whole during the actress\'s absence.\r\n\r\nC and D are incorrect.

The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $500,000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15, the landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30, the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then, but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. When the landowner tendered the deed and possession on January 30, the farmer refused to accept either, and refused to pay the $500,000.

These facts do not suggest excuse on grounds of impossibility. C is incorrect. Although the landowner\'s failure to deliver possession was a breach, it was only a partial breach. D is incorrect.

The presumed wide availability of credit limits a borrower\'s recovery to the additional cost of obtaining a loan from another lender. In the typical case, a lender has no reason, at the time of contract formation, to foresee that a borrower will not be able to obtain a substitute loan. Furthermore, at the time of contract formation under these facts, the bank was not aware and had no reason to be aware of the merchant\'s opportunity to purchase the carpets. Therefore, the merchant\'s recovery is limited to the difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and one at 8%.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Damages for lost opportunities may be recoverable in some cases as consequential damages for a breach of contract. However, consequential damages for the lost opportunity to purchase the carpets are not appropriate under these facts for two reasons.

The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery.

This question doesn\'t raise an issue of waiver or retraction of a waiver, because there is no indication that payment within 15 days at a 5% discount is inconsistent with the parties\' agreement. In fact, the seller\'s invoice is silent on the matter. Instead, the question goes to the meaning of the agreement made by the parties.

An attempted retraction is ineffective, however, if it occurs after the injured party has materially changed its position in reliance on the repudiation.

The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $18,000.

This rule is intended to protect the substantial reliance of the offeree that results when accepting an offer for a unilateral contract by performance over a period of time.

An offeree\'s power of acceptance may terminate due to a lapse of time when the offeree fails to accept the offer within the time stated in the offer or within a reasonable time. In this case, the offer did not include an express time limitation. Therefore, the buyer could accept within a reasonable period of time. The email exchanges between the buyer and the seller demonstrate that the buyer accepted the seller\'s offer within a reasonable time period.

The 100 bolts were shipped, and the buyer paid the seller. Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. The buyer thereupon tendered back the wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment. The seller refused on the ground that there is no difference between No. 1 quality wool and No. 2 quality wool.\r\n\r\nCan the buyer resell the wool?', 'Answer B is correct.  When a seller has delivered nonconforming goods, and the buyer justifiably revokes acceptance, the buyer has a security interest in the goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price. The buyer may hold such goods and resell them in the same manner as an aggrieved seller. The buyer, in this case, becomes a person in the same position as a seller and has the same remedies as a seller. Therefore the buyer can resell the goods at either a public or private sale, the same way an aggrieved seller could. For these reasons, Answer D is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Although it is true that the buyer may resell goods at a private sale, this right only exists if the seller is given reasonable notice. Because this answer choice makes no reference to notice to the seller, Answer B is a more thorough choice than Answer A.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect.  As stated above, the buyer may resell goods at either a public or private sale.

The contract contained the following provision: \"It is understood and agreed that the purchaser\'s obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of said apartment house.\"\r\n\r\nWhich of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?', 'C is correct. This question deals with the distinction between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent, and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions that can occur together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. Therefore, each condition acts as a condition precedent to the other. Finally, a condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs. C is the least accurate statement because the purchaser\'s tendering of good title to the farm does not excuse the building owner\'s duty to convey good title to the apartment house.\r\n\r\nHere, the building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser, and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner, or no further duty arises for either party. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after), the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment. Therefore, the building owner\'s conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser\'s tender of the farm are concurrent conditions, and in effect, each is a condition \"precedent\" to the other.

The subcontractor then breached by unjustifiably refusing to perform further. The contractor reasonably spent $120,000 to have the work completed by another subcontractor.\r\n\r\nThe subcontractor sues the contractor for the reasonable value of benefits conferred, and the contractor counterclaims for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following should be the court\'s decision?', 'Answer C is correct. A party in breach generally is entitled to restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the way of part performance in excess of any loss to the non-breaching party resulting from the breach. In measuring restitution to the breaching party, the value of the benefit conferred should not exceed the contract price for such services. The subcontractor appears to have entered into a losing contract, since the value of the services rendered up to the time of breach ($150,000) exceeds the contract rate for such services ($100,000). But because the subcontractor was the breaching party, he is not entitled to recover the amount by which the reasonable value of his services exceeded the contract rate; rather he is limited to restitution of what he would have earned on the contract.\r\n\r\nBecause the subcontractor has already been given progress payments of $100,000 for the work, there is no basis for restitution to the subcontractor. The contractor, however, is entitled to the damages resulting from the subcontractor\'s breach. Specifically, the contractor may recover the additional $20,000 cost of hiring another subcontractor to complete the work that the subcontractor refused to do.

A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to a duty. Constructive conditions of exchange can be waived through conduct, by treating a breach as only a partial breach and continuing to perform the contract. Although a waiver may be retractable in certain situations, a waiver is not retractable once the non-waiving party has relied on the waiver. When the corporation accepted only two game-designs per year during the first three years of the contract, the corporation implicitly waived the computer whiz\'s breach of the annual-quantity term of the contract. The computer whiz relied on this waiver when he spent substantial sums on equipment for future design work. Therefore, it would be unjust to allow the corporation, without prior notice, to claim that the computer whiz breached the annual-quantity term in year four.

When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the other party\'s performance, the other may make a written demand for adequate assurances of performance and suspend return performance if commercially reasonable.

The victim of a breach is entitled to recover only those damages which could not reasonably have been avoided. Failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages defeats only a claim for consequential damages. It does not deprive the victims of the breach of the opportunity to claim damages measured by the difference between contract and market price.

However, consideration is required for a settlement to be enforceable. Under the preexisting duty rule, the creditor\'s promise to forbear from suing to collect was not supported by consideration from the debtor, because the amount due was liquidated and the debtor promised to do nothing more than he was already obligated to do.

Under Article 2, evidence of trade usage that can be construed as reasonably consistent with an agreement\'s express language is admissible to interpret or supplement an agreement. The majority rule provides that trade usage will be viewed as consistent with an agreement\'s express language unless the usage completely negates specific express language. The trade usage allowing for a variation of up to 5% does not completely negate but rather qualifies the express language calling for the delivery of 100,000 bushels of wheat. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the rule stated above applies regardless of whether the written agreement is a complete integration.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Under UCC Â§ 2-601, the applicable standard for determining breach of a non-installment transaction involving a sale of goods is the perfect tender rule and not the substantial performance standard. However, the offered evidence of trade usage would establish that there was no breach; according to the trade usage standards, the farmer\'s delivery of 96,000 bushels was performance that conformed to the agreement.', '2017-09-26 09:14:41', 1, '[\"No, because the offered evidence is inconsistent with the express language of the agreement.\",\"No, because the written contract was totally integrated.\",\"Yes, because the offered evidence demonstrates that the farmer substantially performed the contract.\",\"Yes, because the offered evidence explains or supplements the agreement by usage of trade.\"]', 3, 'Contract Content and Meaning'),

Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company.\r\n\r\nThe fabric company promptly made an \"assignment of the contract\" to a finance company as security for a $100,000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered, took delivery of, and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5,000) for the new enterprise\'s requirement of the fabric for the first month of its operation.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after making the $5,000 payment to the fabric company, the new business enterprise, by written notice to the fabric company, terminated the agreement for purchase of the elasticized fabric because market conditions had in fact forced the new business enterprise out of the clothing manufacture business. In an immediate suit by the finance company against the new business enterprise for total breach, which of the following would be useful in the new business enterprise\'s defense?', 'Answer D is correct. A party\'s obligations under a requirements contract subject to the UCC are measured by good faith. A shut-down by a requirements buyer due to lack of orders or market conditions meets the good faith standard.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because unless there are circumstances suggesting otherwise, a clause prohibiting the assignment of the \"contract\" will be construed as barring only the delegation of the assignor\'s duties. See UCC Â§2-210. Therefore, the clause would not affect the assignment of payment made by the fabric company to the finance company. Furthermore, a party\'s contractual right is only personal where the nature of the contract is such that the assignment would impair the other party\'s reasonable expectations or would offend public policy. Assignment of a right to payment of money is not the assignment of a personal right.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because the \"assignment of the contract\" was expressly made to a creditor of the fabric company. Rights are assigned and duties are delegated. The use of \"assignment\" language, and the fact that the assignment was made to a creditor, reasonably indicates that the fabric company did not delegate its duties under the contract.

Where a court finds a contract to be unconscionable at the time that the contract is made, it may refuse to enforce the contract or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable term. Unconscionability has been defined as including both procedural and substantive elements: procedural unconscionability refers to defects in the bargaining process that leave a party with no meaningful choice, and substantive unconscionability refers to contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed in light of the situation existing at the time that the contract was made, it appears that both elements are present here: the landholder was in desperate financial straits and ignorant of the value of the rights that he was selling, and the terms of the contract grant timber rights to the logger for a price that is 70% below the market rate. A is incorrect because the mere fact that the logger won the contract with a below-market bid does not suggest bad faith. B is incorrect because there is no evidence of a statement of fact that would give rise to an estoppel.

So even if Pervis did not intend to hit him (to simply frighten him) that â€œassaultâ€ would become a battery by transferred intent anyway, and Bob is going to sue Pervis for battery instead of assault.

That narrows the problem down to a choice between (A) and (B). Since the facts donâ€™t say if Pervis intentionally shot the gun or if it went off by accident, Bob would be wise to accuse Pervis of BOTH battery and negligence.

Maybe he actually saw a real deer and shot the cow by accident. Conversion is an intentional interference with chattel of plaintiffs that substantially deprives the plaintiffs of the use of their property. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, conversion, p. 30.] Here if Hunter deliberately shot Farmerâ€™s cow, thinking it was a deer, it would amount to conversion and (A) would be true. But if Hunter was shooting at something else, whether it was a real deer or not, missed and hit Farmerâ€™s cow by accident it would not be an intentional tort. In that case it would be negligence and (B) would be true. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligence, p. 44.] Since both (A) and (B) could be true, neither is the best answer and you have to choose between (C) and (D).

Second, it would not be true if the National Forest was a â€œfree rangeâ€ area where cows are legally allowed to roam. And it would not be a good answer if the jurisdiction had adopted the â€œlast clear chanceâ€ doctrine, because even if Farmer was negligent, Hunter had the last clear chance to avoid shooting it.

(A) is wrong because both actual and proximate causation must be proven.

(390, 1, 32, '24. Pablo was an internationally famous movie star. He flew all over the world to act in movies, appear at debuts, appear on talk shows and rub elbows with the rich and famous. He booked a flight on Agony Airlines to fly to an appearance in New York City. When he arrived at the airport he found out that he had been booked to a coach seat when his agent had expressly requested a first-class seat in the first three rows.\r\n\r\nPablo was reluctant to be seen in coach because it would hurt his image to be seen with common people. And he wanted to be in the first three rows of first-class because it gave him a buzz to see the looks he got from the coach passengers as they filed down the aisle past him to their decidedly inferior locations. He called his agent and had his agent negotiate with Agony to get him a first-class seat in the first three rows. His agent told him he was only able to get him a seat in row 5. Pablo reluctantly agreed because he really needed to get to New York to push his latest film, â€œEscape from Arizonaâ€.\r\n\r\nAfter Pablo was seated the remaining passengers filed past him. One of them was Wesley Snipes, passenger 57.\r\n\r\nThere were no problems with the flight until it approached La Guardia. A mutant strain of killer geese had invaded Long Island Sound from Canada and there was a danger they might attack the planeâ€™s jet engines as they landed. For passenger safety the plane was diverted to JFK. As the plane landed an alarm went off indicating that one of the landing gear devices had malfunctioned and the plane might crash on landing. The plane circled until there was no choice but to land.\r\n\r\nThe captain told the passengers and crew about the problem and everyone was warned to assume the normal position for a crash landing. When the plane touched down the landing gear collapsed and several passengers in first-class were injured, but Snipes and the rest of the passengers in coach were not injured.\r\n\r\nAfter the crash Agony Airlines admitted flying an airplane is an abnormally dangerous activity. Then it filed for bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIf Pablo was injured, Agony admits airline travel is an abnormally dangerous activity, and there is no statutory provision governing his claim against Agony, Pablo will most likely:\r\n', '(D) The lesson to be learned here is that multiple-choice exams may present single questions based on exceedingly long fact patterns. These use up a lot of your time, yet you can only score â€œone pointâ€ if you get it right. So if you are running behind on time or even running out of time mark these long questions with a big â€œXâ€ and simply select one of the possible answers at random. You have a 25% chance of getting the answer right anyway. And there is no penalty for wrong answers. Then if you have some extra time after you have completed the rest of the exam come back to these few questions and reconsider them. The same strategy can be used when you are stumped between two possible answers for a question. Simply mark the question (e.g. if you canâ€™t decide between (A) and (B) mark it â€œA-B???â€), select one of the possible answers on the answer sheet, and move on! DO NOT WASTE TIME AGONIZING OVER A DECISION BETWEEN TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS. Here (C) is wrong because the defendant admits it was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.

(A) and (B) are wrong because they assume the airline will be liable simply because strict liability applies. (D) is correct because the only affirmative defense in a strict liability situation is assumption of the risks and one of the (obvious) risks of air travel is that the plane might crash.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligent entrustment, p. 62 and negligent contracting, p. 63.] (C) is wrong because parents are not responsible for the acts of their children. While some States may have statutes that make parents responsible for tortious acts of their minor children (e.g. California does), that is not the common law or a broadly adopted modern rule that you should apply on law school and Bar exams. (D) is wrong because there is no basis on which to find the Parentis owed Farmer a duty.

There is no evidence they knew the children had trespassed into Farmerâ€™s shed, or that it posed any danger to Farmer, even if they did. (B) is correct because the children had gone into his shed before, so there is no basis to conclude they would not have gone into the shed again even if the Parentis had not hired Barbara.

Under the UCC\'s firm offer rule, an offer by a merchant for the sale of goods contained in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it is firm will be irrevocable, notwithstanding lack of consideration, for the time stated in the offer (or if no time is stated, for a reasonable time), but in no case may the period of irrevocability exceed three months. If the three-month period lapses and no consideration is given to support an option, then the offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance (or before it lapses). Because the retailer\'s firm offer was not supported by consideration, it became revocable as of March 15. However, the lawyer accepted the offer before the retailer revoked it and before the offer lapsed (because the offer stated that it would be open for the entire year); therefore, the retailer is bound to a contract to supply the paper.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because a firm offer becomes revocable after three months unless consideration is given to support an option.

The general contractor used the wallpaper hanger\'s $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors\' Building. Before the bids were opened, the wallpaper hanger truthfully advised the general contractor that the former\'s telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked. Shortly thereafter, the general contractor was awarded the Doctors\' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with another paperhanger for a price of $18,000. The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover $4,000.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor\'s prospect of recovery?', 'Answer B is correct. Unless the promisor has given an option promise supported by consideration, generally an offer is freely revocable until the time of acceptance. However, an offer may be irrevocable to the extent necessary to avoid injustice if the offeror should reasonably expect the offer to induce substantial reliance on the part of the offeree and where there is reliance in fact. The terms of the wallpaper hanger\'s offer suggest that the wallpaper hanger expected the general contractor to rely on his bid by utilizing it in calculating the general contractor\'s overall bid, and the general contractor in fact did rely on his bid. The fact that the general contractor was required to submit a bid bond to guarantee her bid demonstrates the substantial nature of the general contractor\'s reliance, because it shows the general contractor cannot pass the additional wallpapering cost on to the owner. Therefore this fact, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor\'s case for recovery.\r\n\r\nA, C and D are incorrect because, although each of these factors (mitigation of damages, the wallpaper hanger\'s negligence and the general contractor\'s good faith) may weigh in the general contractor\'s favor, the wallpaper hanger revoked her bid prior to the general contractor\'s acceptance.

In this case, to avoid a reduction in her damages, the businesswoman is required to do more than remain ready to work.

The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. A wrongfully discharged employee is expected to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to seek comparable employment. However, if no comparable employment is reasonably available and the businesswoman does not take another job, the businesswoman is entitled to recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years. \r\n\r\nC is incorrect. The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment was probably not a material breach of contract. It represented only a small part of a large contract and can easily be remedied by an award of damages. But even if the breach was material, a court would likely employ the concept of divisibility to preclude the businesswoman from rescinding the contract of sale. As stated in Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 240, a contract is divisible where \"the performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded as agreed equivalents.\" Here, the agreed equivalents would be the sale of the business and the corresponding $25 million purchase price, and the businesswoman\'s promise to work for the company and the corresponding yearly salary of $150,000. Applying this concept, the businesswoman would be able to recover damages for the company\'s breach of its promise to employ her, but she would not be permitted to rescind the contract of sale. \r\n\r\nD is incorrect. The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. The general rule is that employers cannot obtain specific performance requiring an employee who has breached a personal services contract to work for the employer. It is also true generally that courts refuse to grant specific performance of an employment contract against a breaching employer.

Under the UCC, a party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract.

The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery.\r\n\r\nIs the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?', 'Answer A is correct. The issue here is the interpretation of the term \"permanent employment\" in the bakery-chef contract. It is well established that \"permanent employment\" means \"employment-at-will\" in this context. In an employment-at-will relationship, either party can terminate the agreement at any time, without the termination being considered a breach (unless the termination were to violate an important public policy â€” which is not the case here). Accordingly, the chef is not liable for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the bakery will not prevail in a breach of contract action against the chef, but it misstates the reason why this is so. The question whether the job the baker took with the hotel was comparable to the one she left at the bakery is not relevant here. The comparability issue DOES arise in cases in which an employee who has been terminated is offered another job; in such cases the employee\'s claim for breach would be reduced by wages which could have been earned at jobs which are not different and inferior. That is not the case in this problem.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because it is grounded in an incorrect interpretation of the meaning of the word \"permanent\" in the context of employment agreements, as explained above.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it presumes the existence of an \"implied right of first refusal.\" While some contracts do create rights of first refusal, such rights must be created by express agreement, and not by implication. In the context of employment agreements, it is well established that \"permanent employment\" means \"employment-at-will.\" In an employment-at-will relationship, either party can terminate the agreement at any time, without the termination being considered a breach (unless the termination were to violate an important public policy â€” which is not the case here).

Unless the other party to the contract (the obligee, or the chef) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor (the decorator).

In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by consideration. Consideration is a return promise or performance which is bargained-for, i.e., sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of consideration as long as the consideration was bargained-for; it is often said that \"even a peppercorn will suffice\" for consideration. In exchange for the chef\'s promise to pay the sister $6,000, the sister agreed to convey (and promptly conveyed) to the chef a quitclaim deed for a piece of property. Although the sister was aware that her claim to the property was doubtful, and although the deed contained no warranty of title, her promise to convey the quitclaim deed was sufficient consideration to support the chef\'s promise.\r\n\r\nChoice A is incorrect because what matters for finding consideration is the existence of an exchange, even if the values exchanged are unequal (the answer would be different if, instead of giving the quitclaim deed, the sister had promised to forbear from bringing a claim that she knew was doubtful).

When her son found out that the house had been sold and was not part of his mother\'s estate, he sued to have the contract avoided on behalf of the mother. \r\n\r\nOn what ground would the contract most likely be avoided?', 'Answer D is correct. A contract is voidable if the elements of undue influence--undue susceptibility to pressure and excessive pressure--are established. The undue susceptibility element can be established either by the circumstances (e.g., the mother\'s illness) or the existence of a confidential relationship (such as a parent-child relationship). The following facts support a finding of excessive pressure: the daughter\'s statement that she might not visit her mother, the daughter pressuring her mother to sell the property while her mother was in a hospice facility, the mother assenting without obtaining independent advice, and the mother\'s susceptibility to pressure.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. A contract can be avoided on the basis of duress. However, the facts fail to establish the elements of duress. Duress requires an improper threat. The daughter\'s statement that she might not visit her mother does not constitute an improper threat sufficient to support avoidance based on duress.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. If a bargained-for exchange is present, there is no additional requirement, such as an equivalency of exchange, to satisfy the consideration requirement of an enforceable contract. Moreover, the imbalance in the exchange between the mother and her daughter does not constitute the gross inadequacy of exchange that so shocks the conscience as to warrant invalidating the agreement.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect.

Because the fixtures company-apartment complex contract is an installment contract and because the fixtures company gave assurances that the defective shipment would be cured within five days, the apartment complex must accept the rest of the shipment and would not be justified in canceling the rest of the contract.\r\n\r\nA and B are incorrect because the UCC\'s \"perfect tender\" rule (which entitles a buyer to reject a tender of delivery that fails in any respect to conform to the contract) does not apply to installment contracts. C is incorrect because a buyer under an installment contract may treat the contract as breached only if the non-conformity of one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the contract as a whole.', '2017-10-02 10:11:25', 1, '[\"The apartment complex is entitled to accept any number of the 24 sets, reject the rest, and cancel the contract both as to any rejected sets and the lot due on April 1.\",\"The apartment complex is entitled to accept any number of the 24 sets and to reject the rest, but is not entitled to cancel the contract as to any rejected sets or the lot due on April 1.\",\"The apartment complex must accept the 24 sets but is entitled to cancel the rest of the contract.\",\"The apartment complex must accept the 24 sets and is not entitled to cancel the rest of the contract.\"]', 3, 'Performance, Breach, and Discharge'),

(663, 1, 22, 'An agent engaged an inexperienced actress to do a small role in a new Broadway play for a period of six months at a salary of $200 a week. The actress turned down another role in order to accept this engagement. On the third day of the run, the actress was hospitalized with influenza and a replacement was hired to do the part. A week later, the actress recovered, but the agent refused to accept her services for the remainder of the contract period. The actress then brought an action against the agent for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the actress\'s best legal theory?', 'D is correct. Under the Doctrine of Constructive Conditions, a party\'s material breach of an obligation, if uncured, may discharge the other party\'s obligation under the contract. Therefore, the agent\'s obligation may only be discharged if the actress\'s inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the actress may cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress\'s failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit under the contract. If the actress is found not to have materially breached, then the agent\'s failure to accept her services for the remainder of the engagement would, in turn, be found to be a material breach. This answer offers the best legal theory because none of the other answers offer the actress a basis for arguing breach of contract.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Even if the contract were severable, it is not relevant to whether the agent\'s remaining obligation to engage the actress may be discharged.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. Although impossibility of performance could provide a basis for excuse for the actress, it would not support the actress\'s argument that the agent breached the contract.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. The issue presented is not whether the agent owed a duty to the actress on the basis of reliance or otherwise (he clearly did, based on the agreement between them), but rather whether the agent breached that duty.', '2017-10-06 05:21:31', 1, '[\"Her acting contract with the agent was legally severable into weekly units.\",\"Her performance of the literal terms of the contract was physically impossible.\",\"Her reliance on the engagement with the agent by declining another acting role created an estoppel against the agent.\",\"Her failure to perform for one week was not a material failure so as to discharge the agent\'s duty to perform.\"]', 3, 'Performance, Breach, and Discharge'),

The woman promised to pay the seller, \"as soon as I am able.\" The woman subsequently repudiated this promise and refused to pay the seller anything.\r\n\r\nWhat effect does this quoted language have on enforceability of the promise?', 'Answer D is correct. A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms, the promisor unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances (e.g., \"I\'ll buy it if I feel like it.\"). Such a promise is an illusory promise. The modern approach, however, is to construe a promise wherever possible so as not to be illusory. This can be done, for example, by reading into the promise an obligation to exercise discretion in good faith. So long as the promisor has limited her freedom of action in some way, the court will find consideration sufficient to enforce the return promise. When the woman promised to pay $100 \"as soon as I am able,\" she limited her freedom of action in that she will become obligated to pay the purchase price when it can be demonstrated that she has the ability to pay.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect.  A voidable promise occurs when a party to the contract has the power to disaffirm the agreement.  This occurs when there a legal reason to render the agreement unenforceable including fraud, duress and infancy.  As stated above, there is valid consideration to enforce the return promise.  Therefore, it is not a voidable promise.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because a court will construe the quoted language as limiting the woman\'s freedom of action in some way. This limitation will be sufficient consideration to enforce the return promise. C is incorrect because the seller (and not the woman) will bear the burden of demonstrating that the condition has been satisfied.', '2017-10-06 05:23:11', 1, '[\"It makes the promise voidable.\",\"It makes the promise illusory.\",\"It requires the woman to prove her inability to pay.\",\"It requires the seller to prove the woman\'s ability to pay.\"]', 3, 'Formation of Contracts'),

The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower, operated the farm, and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed.

One of the stupidest falsehoods ever foisted on law students is the so-called â€œDeadly Weapon Doctrineâ€. A â€œdeadly weaponâ€ is simply any object used in a manner calculated to cause a homicide. It does not have to be a gun or knife, and guns and knives are NOT â€œdeadly weaponsâ€ if they are used in a manner that is not â€œcalculated to cause deathâ€. The term â€œcalculated to cause deathâ€ means used in a manner that is intended to kill. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, intent to kill, p. 69.] (B) is correct because Donâ€™s use of the gun to shoot Vic in the foot supports a finding of â€œintent to cause great bodily injuryâ€, and it caused a death, and those two facts support either a murder conviction or a finding of involuntary manslaughter. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, intent to cause great bodily injury, p. 70.] The fact Vic died because of an allergic reaction is irrelevant because Donâ€™s act was the actual and proximate cause of Vicâ€™s death.

Modernly burglary still requires proof of a trespassory entry, and if that is proven it generally supports a finding of â€œconstructive breakingâ€.

For there to be a â€œburglaryâ€ under the common law there must be an entry of a dwelling in the night. That did not happen here, so this could only be a â€œmodern law burglaryâ€. A modern law burglary still requires a â€œtrespassory entryâ€ and here the store is open for business. That means Sonny has permission to enter the store.

Maybe he actually saw a real deer and shot the cow by accident. Conversion is an intentional interference with chattel of plaintiffs that substantially deprives the plaintiffs of the use of their property. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, conversion, p. 30.] Here if Hunter deliberately shot Farmerâ€™s cow, thinking it was a deer, it would amount to conversion and (A) would be true. But if Hunter was shooting at something else, whether it was a real deer or not, missed and hit Farmerâ€™s cow by accident it would not be an intentional tort. In that case it would be negligence and (B) would be true. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligence, p. 44.] Since both (A) and (B) could be true, neither is the best answer and you have to choose between (C) and (D).

Second, it would not be true if the National Forest was a â€œfree rangeâ€ area where cows are legally allowed to roam. And it would not be a good answer if the jurisdiction had adopted the â€œlast clear chanceâ€ doctrine, because even if Farmer was negligent, Hunter had the last clear chance to avoid shooting it.

(A) is wrong because both actual and proximate causation must be proven.

As the burglar was climbing down the ladder shattered, the burglar was badly injured and Owenâ€™s TV was destroyed.\r\n\r\nIs Bill liable to the burglar for negligence?', '(A) Answer (A) is the best answer because the ladder was a â€œhidden danger on the land of Owenâ€. Owen was gone, so Bill was temporarily the â€œoccupierâ€ of the land. Under the common law he had no duty to â€œunforeseeable, unknown trespassersâ€.

The plane had to make an unscheduled stop in Bangor, Maine to unclog the toilet system, and it skidded off the icy runway, badly injuring Cheech.\r\n\r\nIf Cheech sues Chong:', '(C) Answers (A) and (B) are wrong because the accident was not caused by Chong smoking in violation of the FAA rule. Rather it was caused by him flushing the plastic wrap down the toilet after he finished smoking. If Chong had done the same thing (flushing the plastic) without ever smoking at all, Cheech still would have been injured. Therefore, Chongâ€™s breach of the FAA rule was not the actual cause of Cheechâ€™s injury. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, actual cause, p. 3.] (C) is correct because if he could not reasonably foresee his actions were putting anyone in danger he had no duty based on peril. . [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, duties created by peril, p. 49.] It could be argued that he assumed a duty to obey Agony Air rules when he bought his ticket.

He booked a flight on Agony Airlines to fly to an appearance in New York City. When he arrived at the airport he found out that he had been booked to a coach seat when his agent had expressly requested a first-class seat in the first three rows.\r\n\r\nPablo was reluctant to be seen in coach because it would hurt his image to be seen with common people. And he wanted to be in the first three rows of first-class because it gave him a buzz to see the looks he got from the coach passengers as they filed down the aisle past him to their decidedly inferior locations. He called his agent and had his agent negotiate with Agony to get him a first-class seat in the first three rows. His agent told him he was only able to get him a seat in row 5. Pablo reluctantly agreed because he really needed to get to New York to push his latest film, â€œEscape from Arizonaâ€.\r\n\r\nAfter Pablo was seated the remaining passengers filed past him. One of them was Wesley Snipes, passenger 57.\r\n\r\nThere were no problems with the flight until it approached La Guardia. A mutant strain of killer geese had invaded Long Island Sound from Canada and there was a danger they might attack the planeâ€™s jet engines as they landed. For passenger safety the plane was diverted to JFK. As the plane landed an alarm went off indicating that one of the landing gear devices had malfunctioned and the plane might crash on landing. The plane circled until there was no choice but to land.\r\n\r\nThe captain told the passengers and crew about the problem and everyone was warned to assume the normal position for a crash landing.

You have a 25% chance of getting the answer right anyway. And there is no penalty for wrong answers. Then if you have some extra time after you have completed the rest of the exam come back to these few questions and reconsider them. The same strategy can be used when you are stumped between two possible answers for a question.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligent entrustment, p. 62 and negligent contracting, p. 63.] (C) is wrong because parents are not responsible for the acts of their children.

There is no evidence they knew the children had trespassed into Farmerâ€™s shed, or that it posed any danger to Farmer, even if they did.

Juan believes the mist is causing the peppers to be discolored at his jalapenÌƒo farm.\r\n\r\nWhat is Juanâ€™s best cause of action against Gonsanto?', '(A) Answer (A) is clearly the best answer. To prevail in a trespass to land action Juan only has to prove Gonsanto has caused â€œparticulate matterâ€ to enter his land. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, trespass to land, p. 28] If he does that he has a legal right to a remedy for all damages caused. The facts state that a â€œmistâ€ is emitted by the defendantâ€™s plant and drift across the valley. If he proves that mist settles on his land and discolors his peppers he will win. Juan does not have to prove Gonsanto acted unreasonably in an action for trespass to land. In comparison, (B), (C) and (D) all are inferior causes of action because for those causes of action Juan has to prove Gonsanto acted unreasonably.

She paid them $20,000 down and they carried the loan balance at 5%. When Jenny was moving her furniture into the house Ron came buy with some clients and was shocked to hear Jennyâ€™s story.

Whether it was legally enforceable before it was performed is now moot. (B) is wrong because he had an â€œexclusive listing agreementâ€ so he has a right to be paid his commission regardless of who buys the house or how they heard it was for sale. (C) is correct because under the Equal Dignity Rule real estate listing agreements (brokerage contracts) must also be in writing to be legally enforceable because they derive their value from a sale of land, and are, therefore, also conveyances of â€œinterestsâ€ in land. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, equal dignity rule requires written broker agreements, p. 82.] (D) is wrong because â€œpromissory estoppelâ€ is an equitable theory under which a Court has discretion to grant a remedy.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, consideration, p. 5.] (A) is wrong because contract parties do not have to receive anything. Rather they have to give or do something. (B) is wrong because the issue is whether Natasha is bound by a contract, not Badenov. (C) is wrong because even though Bullwinkle benefited from his studies, he also had to pay Badenov, and that is giving something he previously had no legal duty to do.

Ken agreed so a contract formed. But the performance of both parties is subject to the condition that Barbie must return with Bunny.

When the words of the parties are quoted, pay close attention to the exact words used. Semantics is very important. Although Tramp says the gift is intended â€œto establish an orphanageâ€ the word â€œtoâ€ does not suggest a bargained for exchange like the word â€œifâ€. Tramp did not say, â€œI will give you this money if you promise to use it to establish an orphanage.â€ If he had said that, it would be a contract offer, because he would be seeking a promise from Foulwell in exchange for the money. But those were not the words he used. Foulwellâ€™s response was merely a gift promise given in exchange. That makes this an exchange of gift promises.

That makes (C) the best answer, because if moral obligation is considered to be legal consideration in this particular jurisdiction, Calhoun would win. (B) is wrong because Butler never said he was paying Calhoun for his â€œprior servicesâ€. Rather he was paying Calhoun out of a sense of moral obligation for saving his life. (D) is wrong because contracts are created in law by offer and acceptance, not â€œdetrimental relianceâ€. Rather, detrimental reliance is an argument that if no enforceable contract existed, the court might enforce Butlerâ€™s promise in equity. But that is not the CALL of the question.', '2017-10-12 07:42:22', 1, '[\"No, because moral obligation is insufficient consideration to support a contract.\",\"No, because the prior services of Calhoun were not given in exchange for being paid in the future.\",\"Yes, if moral obligation is considered to be legal consideration.\",\"Yes, if Calhoun relied on Rhett\\u2019s promise.\"]', 2, 'Formation of Contracts'),

Without a legal contract Vic could not be â€œlegally obligatedâ€ and there could be no â€œbreach of contractâ€.

Then he abandoned the land and repudiated the contract.\r\n\r\nWill Farmer succeed in a breach of contract action against Tom?', '(C) Under the Statute of Frauds a lease of land for more than a year must be in writing to be legally enforced. So, if the agreement between Farmer and Tom was oral, it is not enforceable, and Farmer could not recover the entire amount of $7,200. But month-to-month lease agreements can always be legally enforced, and since Tom agreed to pay $300 each month and had possession for over 5 months he would owe Farmer $1,800 whether the agreement was written or not. (A) is wrong because it says Farmer will â€œonlyâ€ recover if the lease agreement was in writing, and that is not true as to the $1,800 Tom owes.

(A) is correct because if Fries â€œreasonably expected to be paidâ€ a Court of equity could grant Fries a judgment based on implied-in-law contract theory.

Finally, (C) is wrong because Paulâ€™s notice to Thomas on 2/26 that he could not get the paint on time is clearly an anticipatory repudiation, a major breach.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, subsequent failure of implied condition, p. 27.] (A) is wrong because contractual duties and benefits do not terminate at the death of the parties. Rather, they become duties and assets of their estates. (C) is wrong because even though Hal and Wanda have given Anadarko a license to enter the land (that is what a lease does), that does not excuse Anadarko from performing its duties under the terms of that license. (D) is wrong because bankruptcy does not excuse Anadarko from its obligations. The oil-lease it has purchased from Hal and Wanda would be an asset of Anadarko and it will either sell or retain that asset in bankruptcy. In either case the duties and benefits of the lease will survive bankruptcy unless the asset becomes entirely worthless. (B) is the correct answer because if the government seizes the land Anadarkoâ€™s performance becomes either illegal or impossible or both, the purposes for which the parties entered into the contract will be frustrated, the contract will fail (for failure of an implied material condition), and both parties will be excused from performance.', '2017-10-13 03:44:16', 1, '[\"Hal and Wanda died before the 20- year period ended.\",\"The State of Texas seized the land and everything on it by eminent domain to be part of the Texas Oil Reserve.\",\"Hal and Wanda had given Anadarko a license to enter their land.\",\"Anadarko declared bankruptcy before the lease expired.\"]', 1, 'Subsequent failure of implied condition'),

After Gonsanto delivered 1,000 gallons of Killzitol to Farmer, Congress enacted a law prohibiting the sale of FYB, the main ingredient in Killzitol.

That is what makes them â€œexpressâ€ rather than â€œimpliedâ€. It is simply nonsense to say, â€œThe express conditions implied that...â€ Implied conditions are simply implied by the purposes of the parties and the circumstances within which the contract forms, not the express provisions of the agreement. (B) is correct. The term â€œconstructive conditionâ€ means a condition that is implied by the circumstances of the contract. Usually it means the circumstances imply one party has a duty to perform in some manner before the other party is bound, but it can also mean the circumstances imply some â€œorder of performanceâ€ is necessary to bind a party. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, constructive conditions, p. 46.] Here the circumstances show the parties did not intend for Ann to be bound until after she was licensed to practice law.

[See â€œSimple Real Property Outlineâ€, priority of mortgage claims, p. 66.] When Bob assigned his claim against the house to Able that gave Able the same claim that was superior to Donâ€™s. The phrase, â€œAble is subrogated to the rights of Bobâ€ in (A) simply means that Bob assigned his rights under the Deed of Trust to Able.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, revocation of gratuitous assignments, p. 64.] When irrevocable assignments conflict, the first in time prevails.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, third-party beneficiary contracts, p. 58.] (B) is wrong because Nancy is an intended beneficiary, not an incidental beneficiary. When Daddy and Bill agreed to modify the construction it was effectively a modification of their contract so that Bill would do the work differently and in exchange Daddy would waive his rights to demand that the construction do as originally promised. (D) is wrong because that is an exchange of consideration. Nancy is a donee beneficiary, and donee beneficiaries have no legal rights to enforce third-party beneficiary contracts against promisees (Daddy is the promisee of Bill here). Donee beneficiaries can legally enforce contracts against breaching promisors (Bill here). But Bill performed the contract as it had been modified, so he was not in breach. Therefore (C) is wrong as Nancy has no legal cause of action against either Daddy or Bill.

You simply have to eliminate the worst answers, try to narrow your choices down to two possible answers and pick one of them. Here the question asks if Cliff was a third-party beneficiary of Ronâ€™s â€œworkâ€. That must mean â€œcontract with Anneâ€ because the only â€œworkâ€ Ron did that concerned Cliff was under that contract. (A) is wrong because Cliffâ€™s rights under the Anne-Ron agreement do not depend on the Anne-Cliff agreement referred to. And even if the writer of the question meant to say â€œunder the agreement between Anne and Ronâ€ this would still be a wrong answer. (B) is wrong because Cliff could not be a â€œthird-party beneficiaryâ€ of the Anne-Cliff agreement because he is a party to that same contract. (C) is wrong because it does not respond to the CALL. (D) is wrong because Cliff is a third- party beneficiary of the Anne-Ron contract. So all 4 answers are wrong and are going to have to guess which of them was supposed to be the â€œrightâ€ answer before someone at the Bar screwed it up.

(A) is wrong because it suggests Harry might claim he entered into the Tom-Harry contract as a result of a â€œunilateral mistakeâ€ that Tom knew or should have known of. But a claim of â€œunilateral mistakeâ€ is not allowed as a defense when the partiesâ€™ â€œmistakeâ€ is simply about what the properties bought or sold are worth.

Under that modification some unspecified motorcycle dealer was going to benefit, so that unnamed dealer was an intended third-party beneficiary.

Dick offered to carry a second (to loan Tom part of the price as a subordinated claim against the property) for $30,000 at 7%. Tom agreed to that and succeeded in getting a loan for $290,000 at 5.5%. On September 1 Tom tendered payment of $370,000. Dick refused to accept the money.

(B) is correct because Tom did not act to seek a remedy against Dick within a reasonable period of time, and for Tom to block the sale to Harry the â€œnext yearâ€ would unjustly prejudice Dickâ€™s position. (C) is correct but it is not the best answer because even though Tom could plea for promissory estoppel, Dick would counter that plea with the defense of laches. (D) is wrong because the oral agreement between Tom and Dick, that Dick would accept less than $400,000, was not in writing, and this was a contract for the sale of land. As a result, the agreement (a modification of their contract) was not legally enforceable, and could only be considered a â€œwaiver of conditionâ€. And waivers of conditions are always revocable at law. So when Dick refused to accept $370,000, he was merely revoking his waiver of the contract condition that Tom could pay $370,000 instead.

Breaching a contract is illegal (that is why the law provides a remedy), and threatening to breach a contract is just as illegal. (B) is wrong because Bill did not raise a â€œgood faith, reasonable contract dispute.â€ (C) is the best answer because Bill cannot win at law in a breach of contract action since the modification was not supported by consideration. Therefore, he can only plead in equity, and he cannot obtain a remedy in equity because he has unclean hands.

Mowenâ€™s mower broke down and he was not able to finish mowing until Saturday.\r\n\r\nIf Farmer has suffered no damages as a result of the delay but refuses to pay Mowen anyway:', '(C) Answer (A) is wrong because Farmerâ€™s promise to pay was subject to the constructive condition precedent that Mowen had to perform as promised. Mowen did not perform as promised because he was late finishing the job. As a result Mowen was in breach, and Farmerâ€™s promise did not become a duty to pay. Therefore, it is logically impossible for Farmer to be in breach, whether major or minor until and unless it is determined Mowen substantially performed. If he did, the constructive condition would be excused, and Farmerâ€™s promise to pay would ripen into a duty to pay. But that is a fact for the Court to decide, and until it is decided, Farmer cannot be in breach. (B) is wrong because Mowen is the breaching party and as such cannot have suffered any â€œdamagesâ€.

Dick accepted Tomâ€™s $200,000 bid first, and then Harry accepted Tomâ€™s $300,000 bid. Tom had to decline Harryâ€™s job, so Harry engaged the services of a different contractor.

The fact that Tom did not make the profit he â€œexpectedâ€ from entering into a contract with Harry was not caused by Dickâ€™s later breach, so it did not constitute either reliance or consequential damages. As a result, Tomâ€™s total damages caused by the breach were $171,000. But Tom has a right to an award measured by legal restitution, the amount of benefit his efforts conveyed upon Dick. Since the contract amount was $200,000 and Dick only had to spend $25,000 more to complete the house, Tom has conveyed $175,000 in benefits on Dick. (A) is wrong because even though Tomâ€™s damages were $171,000, he has a right to be paid $175,000 in legal restitution.

But the CALL here asks about Tammyâ€™s â€œrightsâ€, and that concerns the remedies she would have at law, not in equity. The contract here cannot be performed within a year from the date of execution because it was created in May, and Tammy was to perform contract duties until the end of May of the next year. So it is not legally enforceable for the entire period specified. But that does not mean it is void entirely. It would not be unenforceable for the period that Tammy has already performed.

Pacific asserts that it did not breach the lease because the phrase â€œoriginal conditionâ€ only meant the condition of the land in 2005 before it entered into the five- year lease extension.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the most accurate statement?', '(B) Answer (C) is wrong because contract terms are interpreted according to intentions of the parties and the â€œrules of constructionâ€ and not by whether enforcement would be â€œfairâ€ or â€œprofitableâ€ for each party. Under the rules of construction written contracts with â€œmerger clausesâ€ will be determined by the plain meaning of the contract words themselves unless the contracts are clearly incomplete on their faces or the merger clauses were incorporated by fraud or mistake. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, four corners doctrine, p. 40.] However, evidence of the past course of dealing between the parties and terms of the trade are always admissible to establish the meaning of contract terms. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, course of dealing and terms of trade, p. 41.] And contracts should be interpreted to give effect to all provisions, if possible. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, resolving contradicting provisions, p. 42.] (D) is wrong because interpretation disputes are not â€œmutual mistakesâ€ that would void all contracts. If it were so, every contract could be voided after the fact by simply disputing the meanings of the words used. (A) is wrong because the term â€œoriginal conditionâ€ has a plain meaning and is not ambiguous in and of itself. (B) is correct because if ambiguous terms in contracts cannot be resolved by extrinsic evidence or other rules of interpretation, they will generally be interpreted against the drafter of the document. Pacific could have written the contract to say â€œoriginal condition at the beginning of the 2005 lease extensionâ€ and it did not. Its failure to expressly state what â€œoriginal conditionâ€ meant created the ambiguity, and it would bear the burden of the result. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, resolution of ambiguity against drafter, p. 42.]', '2017-10-15 14:12:17', 1, '[\"The contract was void from the beginning because the term \\u201coriginal condition\\u201d is fatally ambiguous.\",\"If the meaning of \\u201coriginal condition\\u201d cannot be determined otherwise, Bob would win.\",\"The court would hold for Pacific if the cost of restoring the land to the 2000 condition would exceed the contract amount.\",\"The contract was void from the beginning because there was a mutual mistake about the meaning of the terms.\"]', 1, 'Resolution of ambiguity against drafter, p. 42.'),

At the end of that time White promised to give Jose the Deed to the house. Jose paid White $40,000 and took possession of the house. After that Jose paid White $1,000 every month for 10 years, a total of $120,000. At the end of the 10 year period White claimed Jose was just a renter and refused to deliver the Deed to the house.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the most accurate statement?', '(C) The Part Performance Doctrine is broadly adopted law, but States vary widely in their implementation of the concept. It allows a Court to legally enforce an oral agreement for the sale of land in certain circumstances even though the Statute of Frauds has not been satisfied, if the buyer has taken exclusive possession of the land, paid all or almost all of the purchase price or otherwise has made valuable improvements, and the acts of the parties can only be explained by the conclusion that the land was sold under an oral agreement. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, contracts conveying interests in land / part performance doctrine, p. 35.] (A) and (B) are wrong because Jose took exclusive possession, paid the entire sale price, and a mere â€œrenterâ€ would not have paid White $40,000 at the beginning of the transaction. Under these circumstances the Part Performance Doctrine, at least in some States, would give Jose a legal right to the land, and he would not have to depend on an equitable argument. (D) is wrong for the same reason. Detrimental reliance is an equitable argument and the Part Performance Doctrine, at least when adopted by statute, provides legal rights. (C) is correct because the beginning payment of $40,000 cannot be explained by any conclusion except that Jose was buying and not just renting the land.', '2017-10-15 14:15:17', 1, '[\" Jose has no legal right to title.\",\"A court of equity can enforce the oral agreement.\",\"Jose has a legal right to take title in many jurisdictions because a renter would not have made the $40,000 down payment.\",\"Jose has a right to a remedy if he detrimentally relied on White\\u2019s promise.\"]', 2, 'Contracts conveying interests in land / part performance doctrine, p. 35.'),

When Max was almost done with the painting Sam noticed Max was using Kelly-Moore paint instead of Dunn- Edwards. Uncertain about what to do, Sam remained silent as Max finished the job and began packing up his tools. Finally Sam said, â€œGee, Max, you were supposed to use Dunn- Edwards paint and used Kelly-Moore instead.â€ Max responded, â€œYeah. This Kelly-Moore is just as good and I got a better price on it.â€ Sam refused to pay Max.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the most accurate statement?', '(A) If contract parties become aware other parties have committed major breaches and allow the breaching parties to continue performance they are deemed to have â€œwaived the breachâ€ by â€œelectingâ€ to treat them as minor, not major breaches. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, waiver of major breach, p. 78.] Consequently, if the performing parties otherwise are found to have substantially performed, constructive conditions will be excused and the non-breaching parties promise to pay for performance will ripen into a duty to pay, with an offset for damages caused by the breaches of the performing parties. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, restitution to breaching party, p. 91.] (B) and (C) are wrong because Sam allowed Max to continue performance after discovering he had violated an express condition of the contract. That â€œwaived the breachâ€ and left Max with a legal right to be paid. (D) is wrong because Samâ€™s promise to pay Max was subject to the constructive condition that Max had to perform as promised. He did not, and because of that breach Samâ€™s promise to pay him never ripened into a duty to pay. Consequently, it was logically impossible for Sam to breach the contract at all. (A) is correct because Max would be held to have substantially performed, and that will excuse the constructive conditions leaving Sam with a duty to pay him the contract price less any damages caused by the breach. If Sam cannot prove there is any difference in the quality of the two paints he must pay Max $3,000.', '2017-10-15 14:18:55', 1, '[\"Sam must pay Max $3,000 if he cannot prove Kelly-Moore paint is not as good as Dunn-Edwards paint.\",\"Max breached an express condition of the contract and has no legal right to be paid.\",\"Max\\u2019s only remedy is to seek equitable restitution.\",\"Sam has committed a major breach of contract by refusing to pay Max.\"]', 0, 'Waiver of major breach, p. 78.'),

Second, you are told the quoted statute is the only relevant law, so you are being tested on your ability to read, understand and apply that statute. The fact this says the statute is from the â€œUCCâ€ is entirely irrelevant. (A) is wrong because the quoted statute says nothing about â€œprivity of contractâ€ extending warranty coverage.

Otherwise it is considered a counteroffer and implied rejection.

That means that if the offeree says, â€œOk!â€ an observer would believe that both parties are legally bound to a clear and complete agreement. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, the OK rule, p. 3.] Under the UCC there are â€œgap fillersâ€ that will allow a Court to impute many missing terms based on past dealings between the parties and standards in the trade.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, reasonable certainty of terms, p. 2.] So ask yourself, if Bob had sent Sam a fax on 2/6 saying â€œOk!â€ what would Sam have thought it meant? (A) is wrong because Samâ€™s initial message did not say how many chokes he was offering to sell to Bob. In fact he asked Bob to tell him how many chokes he wanted to order.

On February 2, the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the collector.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid, sustained rise; on October 15 the hoarder wrote the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment.

Under the UCC, when either party to a contract for the sale of goods repudiates the contract with respect to a future performance that will substantially affect the value of that performance, the non-repudiating party may resort to any appropriate remedy for breach. A repudiation is an unequivocal statement of inability or unwillingness to perform.

The terms of a contract for the sale of goods are established upon acceptance of an offer. Under Uniform Commercial Code Â§ 2-206, an offer to buy goods for prompt shipment is accepted when the seller ships the goods. Because the bottling company\'s acceptance (shipment of the bottles) occurred PRIOR to the receipt of the acknowledgment form, the acknowledgement form was an ineffective attempt to modify the parties\' contract.

This answer correctly concludes that the bottling company will recover consequential damages, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion.

The failure of the latter conditionâ€”convictionâ€”is excused under the doctrine of prevention, which requires that a party refrain from conduct that prevents or hinders the occurrence of a condition, because the authorities themselves prevented the fugitive\'s conviction from occurring. \r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. This answer is nonresponsive because it relates to the enforceability of the agreement between the fugitive and the authorities rather than the enforcement of the purported contract between the authorities and the detective. The dispositive issue is the effect of the nonoccurrence of an express condition. In this case, the detective\'s entitlement to the award was subject to two conditions: the arrest and conviction of the fugitive.

(972, 1, 22, 'While negligently driving his father\'s uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: \"I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.\" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.\r\n\r\nThe son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following provides most significant information in determining whether or not there was bargained-for consideration to support the father\'s promise to the physician?', 'Answer C is correct. When a preexisting duty was owed to a third party, courts may hold that a new promise to do the same action is not sufficient as consideration. If the father had a contract with the woman to pay for all losses, then he had a preexisting duty to pay the physician. Therefore, the father\'s subsequent promise to the physician to pay the bill may not constitute consideration as he was already obligated to pay under his contract with the woman. Thus, the father\'s promise to pay was not bargained-for in exchange for the physician\'s promise to treat the woman. Both the timing of the father\'s call and the existence of a contract between the woman and the father are significant in determining whether there was bargained-for consideration to support the father\'s promise to pay the physician. If an action was already performed before the promise was made, it will not qualify as consideration because it was not \"bargained-for.\" Therefore, if the father\'s promise to pay the physician was made after the physician began treating the woman, then the physician\'s treatment of the woman will not constitute consideration.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The sole fact that the physician had not started treating the woman before the father called him is not enough information to determine if there was bargained-for consideration.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. We do not know if the physician had begun treating the woman before or after the father\'s promise to pay. As stated above, the timing is significant in determining whether there was bargained-for consideration to support the father\'s promise to pay the physician. Therefore, the fact that there was a contract between the father and the woman is not enough information.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect. The sonâ€™s death does not impact the agreement made between the father and the physician. The timing of any promise made between the father and the woman compared with any promise made between the father and the physician is what is at issue.

A unilateral contract is a contract created by an offer that can only be accepted by performance. Here, the father\'s letter could only be accepted by the lender lending $1,000 to the borrower. Generally the offeree is not required to give the offeror notice that he has begun the requested performance, but is required to notify the offeror within a reasonable time after performance has been completed. Therefore, when the lender made the loan to the borrower on the 15th, the contract was effectively accepted even if the father had not yet been notified. Thus, the father\'s death on the 16th does nothing to render the promise made in his letter to the lender ineffective.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. In order to constitute consideration (i) there must be a bargained-for-exchange between the parties; and (ii) there must be a benefit to the promisor or detriment to the promisee. Here, the father wanted the lender to lend the $1,000 to his daughter. The loan was to his benefit.

Its performance was defective, however, and caused damage to the bank\'s operations. \r\n\r\nWhom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company\'s defective performance?', 'Answer B is correct. The retail outlet effectively delegated to the computer service company the outlet\'s duty of performance owed to the bank. However, absent consent by the obligee (the bank) or performance by the delegatee (the computer service company), an effective delegation does not relieve the delegating party (the retail outlet) of its duty to the obligee.

The computer service company expressly agreed with the retail outlet to perform the outlet\'s obligation to the bank, making the bank an intended beneficiary of that obligation.

As an exception to the rule, courts will enforce such a promise if the promise reaffirms a promise made pursuant to an earlier bargained-for exchange that was not enforceable at the time because of infancy. Although the girl\'s earlier promise to pay $100 for the telescope was not enforceable because the girl lacked capacity to contract, her later promise to pay $75 for the telescope is enforceable: first, because the girl no longer lacks capacity to contract; and second, because her subsequent promise falls within the exception to the rule and is enforceable notwithstanding the lack of consideration.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because the issue is not the enforceability of the original contract, but rather that of the subsequent promise.

Under the UCC, any trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity in a place, vocation, or trade so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can be introduced to interpret the parties\' agreement, so long as the usage can be reasonably construed as being consistent with the express terms of the contract. Indeed, the UCC defines \"agreement\" as including the parties\' express terms as well as those that are implied by applicable trade usage. Although the written contract between the computer company and the bank called for delivery \"on or before July 31,\" the trade usage that the computer company seeks to introduce suggests that buyers should allow for up to 30-days\' leeway beyond that date. If the contract were construed in light of this usage, then the August 15 delivery would not be a breach of the contract and the bank would be in breach for refusing to take delivery on that date. The fact that buyers and sellers typically negate the usage with express language if the delivery date is to be construed strictly suggests that the trade usage is fairly persuasive evidence of the parties\' intent.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because even an immaterial delay in delivery would entitle the bank to reject delivery of the computer. B is incorrect because such an inference would not be reasonable if the contract is literally construed as requiring delivery \"on or before July 31.\" C is incorrect because a truckers\' strike would not justify excuse on grounds of impracticability, because the facts do not suggest that the availability of ground shipment is a basic assumption on which the contract was made.', '2017-10-16 07:07:11', 1, '[\"The delay did not materially harm the bank.\",\"The computer company believed, on the assumption that the bank was getting a \\\"super deal\\\" for its money, that the bank would not reject because of the late tender of delivery.\",\"The computer company\'s delay in tender was caused by a truckers\' strike.\",\"A usage in the relevant trade allows computer sellers a 30-day leeway in a specified time of delivery, unless the usage is expressly negated by the contract.\"]', 3, 'Contract Content and Meaning'),

(C) is wrong because Yamahaâ€™s 10/1 offer lapsed on 10/15 pursuant to the terms of the offer.

On October 1 Yamaha faxed Bobâ€™s Music the following: â€œWe will sell you the guitars you ordered on 9/1 except they will have to be model 20C guitars with abalone shell inlays on the frets instead of mother of pearl and black shoulder straps. Please notify you accept these terms by October 15.â€ On November 1 Bobâ€™s Music faxed an acceptance to Yamaha stating, â€œYour terms of 10/1 are accepted.â€\r\n\r\nSuppose Bobâ€™s Music sent Yamaha a fax on October 5 stating, â€œWe accept the terms of your 10/1 fax, but we want a 10% discount for immediate cash payment as you give your other customers. And suppose Yamaha ships in response, and the guitars are accepted. Bobâ€™s Music owes Yamaha $975 because:', '(B) Answer (A) is wrong because Bobâ€™s Music was bound to the contract when it accepted Yamahaâ€™s offer and not just because they accepted the guitars. (C) is wrong because the 10/5 fax from Bobâ€™s Music was an acceptance of the offer and not an acceptance of the guitars. (D) is wrong because Yamahaâ€™s shipment did not bind Bobâ€™s Music. It was bound by its 10/5 acceptance of Yamahaâ€™s offer of 10/1. (B) is correct because a contract formed on 10/5 when Bobâ€™s Music accepted Yamahaâ€™s offer of 10/1 and under UCC 2-207 the acceptance was effective and the additional term asked for, the 10% discount, did not become part of the agreement because it materially changed the terms of the offer. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, acceptance of offer with varying terms, p. 105.]', '2017-10-16 10:24:00', 1, '[\"Bob\\u2019s Music accepted the guitars, thereby binding them to a valid, enforceable contract.\",\"The parties had a valid, enforceable contract but the request by Bob\\u2019s Music for a discount did not become a contract term.\",\"The 10\\/5 fax from Bob\\u2019s Music constituted an acceptance of the guitars and Yamaha never revoked its 10\\/1 offer.\",\"Yamaha\\u2019s shipment bound Bob\\u2019s Music to a contract at $195 per guitar.\"]', 1, 'Acceptance of offer with varying terms, p. 105.'),
(984, 1, 36, '32. Tom told Dick that Harryâ€™s Art Gallery was offering an oil painting called â€œThree Sistersâ€ by Goldberg for $3,000 which was worth far more because Goldberg had recently died in very scandalous circumstances in a convent. Dick sent Harry a telegram saying, â€œI WILL BUY THREE SISTERS BY GOLDBERG FOR $3,000. PAYMENT ENCLOSED. SHIP IMMEDIATELY TO MY ADDRESS - Harry.â€ Dick did not realize Harry was also offering a series of three water color prints by Goldberg featuring nuns in various states of undress for $1,000 each. Harry, acting in good faith, packed up a three-print set of the Goldberg prints and sent them to Dick. Then he sold the oil painting to another customer. In response to an action by Dick, Harry denies they had an enforceable contract.\r\n\r\nDid Dickâ€™s telegram satisfy the Statute of Frauds?', ' (C) This is a deliberately garbled question to teach you how to deal with these situations when they confront you. If someone tells you that the Statute of Frauds requires contracts for the sale of goods over $500 to be in writing, or that the mnemonic for the Statute of Frauds is â€œMY LEGSâ€ with â€œGâ€ or â€œSâ€ standing for â€œsales of goodsâ€, you are dealing with a person who does not really understand the current state of contract law. Contracts for the sale of goods have been governed by UCC 2-201 and not by the â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ under the broadly adopted law in the United States since the last century (Louisiana is the only State that has not adopted UCC Article 2). People who say â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ to mean â€œthe need for a writingâ€ merely cause confusion. So when the CALL of the question asks if the telegram satisfies â€œthe Statute of Fraudsâ€ you have to ask yourself, â€œDo they mean UCC 2-201?â€ Consider the question writer might be saying â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ to mean â€œneed for a writingâ€. If ALL the possible answers are wrong otherwise, you must assume the writer of the question was blind to the fact they wrote a UCC question or else expects you to apply UCC 2-201 as if that were â€œthe Statute of Fraudsâ€. Here, if you assume the term â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ is used to mean â€œneed for a writing as set forth in UCC 2-201â€, that UCC section requires â€œsufficient writingsâ€ to prove a contract formed and it must be signed by the party to be bound UNLESS the contract was for â€œspecial made goodsâ€, or its existence is legally admitted by the party to be bound (in pleadings - an answer to a complaint or a motion or in court or deposition testimony), or to the extent goods or payment for them is accepted, or between merchants when there is a â€œsales confirmationâ€ stating quantity. Here Harry accepted $3,000 in cash, so he is bound to a contract for that amount, $3,000, under UCC 2-201. That $3,000 was the price of the painting he wanted to buy anyway, so no writing is needed. That makes (C) the correct answer and (A), (B) and (D) all wrong answers. (D) is also wrong because the paintings were not â€œspecial madeâ€ by Goldberg to specifications provided by Dick. Even if they had been that still would be a wrong answer because then no writing would be needed either. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, written evidence often needed, p. 106.]', '2017-10-16 01:32:02', 1, '[\"No, because Dick should have been more explicit in his telegram.\",\"Yes, but Dick\\u2019s telegram to Harry would only bind Dick and will not bind Harry.\",\"Yes, because Harry sent the non-conforming shipment.\",\"No, because the paintings were special made by Goldberg.\"]', 2, 'Written evidence often needed, p. 106.'),

In response to an action by Dick Harry denies they had an enforceable contract.\r\n\r\nDid Dickâ€™s telegram satisfy the Statute of Frauds?', ' (D) This question is as garbled as the previous one but in a different way. This is deliberate so you have some exposure to this sort of problem. If you assume the question writer means the phrase â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ to mean â€œthe need for a writingâ€ as set forth in the Statute of Frauds before UCC 2- 201 was adopted only (D) is remotely correct. (A) and (B) are not correct because the telegram is in writing and it clearly shows an offer was made by Dick, but that alone does not provide written proof Harry accepted that offer. (C) is wrong because mistakes by Harry do not eliminate the old Statute of Frauds requirement of sufficient writings to prove there was a contract. (D) becomes the only plausible answer because if UCC 2-201 did not exist, the shipment by Harry would not create the exception to the rule that exists today and Harry would not be bound to a contract under the old Statute of Frauds unless he somehow â€œsigned the telegramâ€ to create a written acceptance which turned the telegram into a written contract signed by both parties.

Ethel suffered severe allergies from the roses.', '(A) Tort plaintiffs claiming battery must prove the defendants acted to intentionally cause them to be â€œtouchedâ€ by something that caused them injury OR that the defendants acted with knowledge with reasonable certainty such a touching would occur. Plaintiffs usually must prove â€œreasonable peopleâ€ would have been injured by the touching that occurred. But when defendants act with knowledge the plaintiffs suffer from particular vulnerabilities plaintiffs only have to prove â€œreasonable people with the same vulnerabilitiesâ€ would have suffered injury.

(A) is correct and (D) is wrong because Lucy knew Ethel was allergic to roses, and the â€œtouchingâ€ was caused when Lucy put the roses where the rose pollen would â€œtouchâ€ Ethel.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, trespass to land, p. 28.] (A) is correct because if the cow is on farmerâ€™s land Hunterâ€™s bullet entered Farmerâ€™s land to strike the cow. So Hunter intentionally caused the bullet to enter Farmerâ€™s land, and that is a trespass to land. (B) is wrong because Hunter might actually have seen a real deer, shot at it and missed, and the bullet could have gone past the deer onto Farmerâ€™s land where it killed the cow. In that case Hunter did not intentionally interfere with Farmerâ€™s cow, and is not liable for conversion. (C) is wrong because Hunter might have actually seen Farmerâ€™s cow and shot and killed it.

(C) is wrong because contributory negligence is never a defense to intentional torts.

The noise it created caused Paul permanent hearing loss because his ears were unusually susceptible to injury by loud noises.\r\n\r\nIs Dan liable to Paul for assault?', '(B) Tort plaintiffs usually must prove â€œreasonable peopleâ€ would have been injured by the defendantâ€™s acts.

(D) is wrong because â€œintent to cause harmâ€ is not a required legal element.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, defense of property, pp. 41-42.] Tom was not acting to protect his car because it was already destroyed. But it is highly likely someone deliberately or accidentally caused Tomâ€™s car to catch on fire, and his potential litigation rights against that unknown person are intangible personal property. And Tom has a right to use reasonable force to protect that personal property right by detaining Harry for a reasonable period of time and in a reasonable manner, and questioning him to ascertain his identity, his address (so he can be served with a subpoena if necessary), and to find out what Harry saw happen. This is the same principal that underlies the â€œShopkeeperâ€™s Privilegeâ€. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, shopkeeperâ€™s privilege, p. 42.] Therefore, (A) is correct. (B) is wrong because this is not a matter of â€œpublicâ€ necessity as Tom is trying to protect his own interests. (C) is close to being correct but Tom is not a â€œshopkeeperâ€.

A guardian ad litem is an adult that has been approved by the Court to act on behalf of a minor in litigation. Typically parents will be appointed to be guardians ad litem for their children. To prevail in a false imprisonment action plaintiffs must prove they were confined against their will by the defendants with no apparent, reasonable means of escape, and that they were aware of their confinement. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, false imprisonment, p. 27.] (A) is wrong because Junior was a minor and lacked legal capacity to consent to be taken out of the state in violation of the Courtâ€™s custody order. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, consent by minors and incompetents, p. 38.] (B) is wrong because the parents were co-conspirators with Wanda because they helped her conceal him. (C) is wrong because the Court (judge) decides who can sue on Juniorâ€™s behalf. Courts can appoint anyone they want to be a guardian ad litem. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, liability of parents to children for their injury, p. 15.] (D) is correct because Junior had no capacity to consent to being taken away in violation of the Courtâ€™s custody decree, so as long as he knew where he was being kept he will win.', '2017-10-17 00:11:37', 1, '[\"He will lose because Junior was never confined against his will.\",\"He will lose because Junior was hidden by Wanda, not by her parents.\",\"He will lose because he cannot sue on behalf of Junior without the consent of Wanda, Junior\\u2019s other guardian.\",\"He will win because Junior knew where he was.\"]', 3, 'False imprisonment, p. 27.'),

So here you actually have two â€œcorrectâ€ answers and you must choose which is best. This is a situation you frequently are faced with on Bar exams! Consider which answer is the more dispositive.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, defamation, p. 78.] A defamation per se is a clearly libelous (written) statement or one that alleges the plaintiff has a â€œloathsome diseaseâ€, has committed a serious crime, or has engaged in sexual, business or professional misconduct. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, clear defamations of the plaintiff, p. 81.] If a defamation is â€œper seâ€ general damages can be presumed. But general damages can also be proven by factual evidence.

(B) is wrong because Mel did not do anything to cause Toad to be apprehensive of a battery. (C) is somewhat suggested by the facts but it is not clear that Toad was actually prevented from leaving. (D) is the best answer because Mel accused Toad of theft in front of Betty Sue, thereby â€œpublishingâ€ a defamation per se, and since Betty Sue asked Toad â€œwhy he took the moneyâ€ Toadâ€™s reputation (for honesty) was clearly damaged.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, public figures and actual malice, p. 83.] â€œActual maliceâ€ means making false statements about the plaintiff with either knowledge they are false or else without an honest, reasonable belief they are true.

(C) is wrong because â€œmurderâ€ is a serious crime, so a false accusation someone is a â€œmurdererâ€ is a defamation per se, and the plaintiff can win general damages without proving special damages.

Burglary is defined as the crime of breaking and entering into a structure for the purpose of committing a felony therein.

The builder orally offered to perform the work for $200,000 if his pending bid on another project was rejected. The homeowner accepted the builder\'s terms and the builder then prepared a written contract that both parties signed. The contract did not refer to the builder\'s pending bid. One week later, upon learning that his pending bid on the other project had been accepted, the builder refused to perform any work for the homeowner.\r\n\r\nCan the homeowner recover for the builder\'s nonperformance?', 'Answer B is correct. The homeowner cannot recover for the builder\'s nonperformance based on the oral condition to the contract. Normally, the parol evidence rule bars from evidence prior or contemporaneous negotiations and agreements that contradict, modify, or vary contractual terms if the contract is intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties\' agreement. However, the condition exception to the parol evidence rule permits the admission of extrinsic evidence to establish an oral condition to the parties\' performance under the contract. Here, the builder\'s acceptance of the contract was conditioned on the rejection of his bid on another project. This condition was not written in the contract. However, as explained above, this oral condition will be allowed into evidence as an exception to the parol evidence rule. Because the builder\'s bid was accepted on the other project, the condition in the contract did not occur, and the builder will not be in breach of the contract. Thus, Answer B is correct, and Answer D is incorrect. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Although contract law supports the principle of efficient breach, the principle does not discharge a breaching party\'s duty to perform or its responsibility to compensate the non-breaching party for damages arising from the breaching party\'s failure to perform. In this case, however, the condition exception to the parol evidence rule permits the admission of extrinsic evidence to establish the oral condition to the parties\' performance under the contract, which, because it was not satisfied, discharged the builder\'s duty to perform. \r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. The builder made a definite commitment to perform even though his duty to perform was conditioned on his other bid being rejected. The builder\'s promise to perform was not illusory, because the possibility that the condition might occur limited the builder\'s freedom of action by binding him to perform if the condition was satisfied.

During cross-examination, a prosecution witness testified that one of the men was in jail on other charges during the last six robberies. That man\'s lawyer has moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\'s case.\r\n\r\nShould the motion be granted?', 'Answer B is correct. At common law, a conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful goal, or to accomplish some lawful goal by unlawful means. A co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. So long as there is an initial agreement among the conspirators to engage in a course of criminal conduct constituting all the crimes, there is only one conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Conspirators must agree on the essential objectives of the conspiracy. In any event, the rationale offered here is inapposite because the problem raised by the question is not failure to agree to the robberies, but not being present during the latter robberies.

In this case, even if the defendant showed that he was in prison during several of the robberies, he could be convicted of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect.

Safety statutes establish negligence per se only if the violated statute was designed to protect the particular class of foreseeable victim as the plaintiff, and the harm the plaintiff suffered was the type that the statute was designed to protect against.

Private nuisance is defined as a condition or activity that interferes with a landowner\'s use and enjoyment of his land to such an extent that the landowner cannot reasonably be expected to bear the condition without compensation. The scope of interference is personal discomfort to the occupants or tangible harm to property, resulting in a diminution of its market value. Nuisance does not require proof of negligence; it just requires actual damages. In this case, the harm to the business was only occasional slight interference. Because the electrical interference was not a substantial and unreasonable interference with the neighbor\'s use and enjoyment of his property, he will not prevail.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because there is no evidence that the activity cannot be performed without risk of serious harm to persons or property no matter how much care is exercised.

The pedestrian then brought an action against the driver for the injuries to his knee and shoulder.\r\n\r\nIn the pedestrian\'s action against the driver, assume that the jury finds that the pedestrian\'s fall was a normal consequence of the original injury, but that the driver could not have foreseen that his negligence would cause the pedestrian\'s fall. For which of his injuries may the pedestrian recover damages?', 'Answer B is correct. The driver is liable for the full extent of the consequential damages arising from injuries to the pedestrian even if some of the injuries did not materialize for some time after the accident. While mere passage of time may cause statute of limitations problems if substantially longer than several months is involved, the passage of time in itself will not give rise to a proximate cause limitation.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The phrase \"takes the victim as he finds him\" refers to the principle that a negligent defendant must pay for the full extent of the injuries to the plaintiff even if the plaintiff was unusually vulnerable to injury. There is no indication in the facts that the pedestrian was unusually vulnerable before the accident.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. The separability of an injury becomes an issue when two or more defendants cause harm to the plaintiff; separability relates to the question of whether damages for specific injuries can be allocated among the defendants.

As a consequence, the man suffered great emotional distress. \r\n\r\nIn an action by the man against the neighbor, which of the following claims would be likely to result in the greatest monetary recovery?', 'Answer B is correct. The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress allows recovery for personal injury despite the absence of physical injury or touching of the plaintiff. The prima facie elements of a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress are (i) an act by the defendant constituting extreme and outrageous conduct, (ii) intent or recklessness by the defendant, (iii) causation, and (iv) damages amounting to severe emotional distress. On these facts, the neighbor was aware that his conduct would cause severe emotional distress, and he could be held liable for the man\'s emotional suffering, as well as for the value of the cat. Thus, Answer B is correct. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The neighbor did not touch the man, so the neighbor is not liable for battery. There was an intentional touching, but the touching constituted only trespass to a chattel. \r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Trespass to chattels provides an action for intentional interference with the plaintiff\'s chattel in a way that causes recognizable harm to the chattel, which was the case here. While the man could state a case of trespass to chattels, any recoverable damages would be limited to $25, the value of the cat. An action establishing intentional infliction of emotional distress would result in a larger recovery. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Conversion provides a cause of action for interference with a chattel that is substantial enough to amount to the exercise of dominion or control. While the man could state a case for conversion, any recoverable damages would be limited. The standard remedy in conversion is a forced sale, so the man could recover no more than $25, the value of the cat.

The patient\'s father was not present at the patient\'s appointment with the psychiatrist, nor did he witness the suicide. The father has brought an action against the psychiatrist to recover for his severe emotional distress and the resulting stroke. \r\n\r\nIs the father likely to prevail?', 'Answer B is correct because a medical professional\'s duty of care extends only to his or her patient. This case is distinguishable from Tarasoff v. The Regents of California because, unlike in that case, the patient here posed no threat to others. Considerations of privacy and confidentiality usually lead courts to deny a duty on the part of therapists to non-patients when only the patient himself is at risk. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the father will not prevail, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. The existence of a physical impact is irrelevant. If recovery for emotional distress were permissible in this situation, a showing of physical impact would not be required. Virtually all jurisdictions have rejected the impact rule in cases involving negligent infliction of emotional distress. Instead, the father will lose because when a patient does not pose a threat to others, a medical professional\'s duty of care usually extends only to the patient. \r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because the fact that the father was a member of the patient\'s immediate family is irrelevant in this kind of emotional distress case. It might well be relevant in a different sort of case- for example, in a case brought by a bystander who suffers emotional distress upon witnessing a negligently caused injury to a family member, or in a case where a psychiatrist might prevent harm to a family member who is threatened by the patient by warning the patient\'s family. In this case, however, the psychiatrist\'s duty of care extended only to the patient. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Even if the father\'s emotional distress is foreseeable, that foreseeability is not ordinarily sufficient to create a duty to the father, who was not the psychiatristâ€™s patient.

However, in a defamation action that involves a matter of public concern--here, a claim brought by a candidate for public office--the plaintiff must establish more than mere negligence with regard to the truth or falsity of the allegedly defamatory statement of fact.

She dressed and went to the garage to get her car and found a car parked in front of her driveway. That car was occupied by a man, who, while intoxicated, had driven to that place and now was in a drunken stupor in the front seat.

In an action for negligence, the plaintiff must allege duty, breach, causation and damages. The key issue here is not whether the ocean liner breached a duty to have a specific type of lifeboat, but whether the storm was so severe that its independent intervention superseded even the launching of a statutorily adequate lifeboat. This is an \"act of god\" situation.

The lifeboats could not have been launched in the storm even if the ocean liner had been properly equipped. B is incorrect. Common carriers are subject to a higher standard of care, not strict liability. Even a claim in strict liability, however, must show that the defendant\'s activity or condition is a proximate (legal) cause of the harm in order to prevail; this is a conclusion which is not supported by the facts. D is incorrect. Assumption of risk is no longer a complete bar to recovery in a negligence claim, absent instructions to follow the common law.

The call of the question does not give a specific claim, but the key word here is \"embarrassment.\" This is a dignitary tort claim. A battery consists of the unlawful application of force to the person resulting in bodily injury or offensive touching, without consent or privilege. Battery is a general intent crime, and the force need not be applied directly. Here, the defendant set into motion an action with purpose or knowledge to a substantial certainty that the offensive contact would result. Therefore, the defendant committed a battery and the politician can recover for the harm to his dignity.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. Negligence allows pain and suffering, but only for actual damages. A claim based on embarrassment must necessarily involve a dignitary tort, such as battery, to succeed. C is incorrect. All that is required is an offensive touching; physical harm is not required.

The jurisdiction has adopted a pure comparative negligence rule in place of the traditional common-law rule of contributory negligence.\r\n\r\nIn this action, will the mechanic obtain a judgment against the woman?', 'D is the correct answer. The key sentence is, \"The collision had caused a small leak in the gasoline tank.\" Also, the woman\'s negligent driving \"solely\" caused the accident. It is foreseeable that a car accident could rupture a gas tank leading the gasoline to ignite and causing severe burn damage to anyone in or near the car. The manner of the accident is not determinative; the mechanic\'s injury was a foreseeable result of the accident. The mechanic\'s injury was not so removed in time and circumstance as to offend fundamental fairness.

D is the best choice because it addresses the issue of proximate cause, which will determine the woman\'s liability to the mechanic.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The woman is not required to know of the gas leak. It is a foreseeable consequence of the car accident.\r\n\r\nB reaches the wrong conclusion. While choice B may contain a true statement, the man\'s failure to warn the mechanic will not be enough to supersede and preclude recovery from the woman.

The pedestrian\'s broken arm is proximately connected to the driver\'s negligent driving. Injuries stemming from being hit by a car include broken bones. The manner in which the arm was broken is not considered, only the injury itself. Courts generally hold that subsequent negligent actions, which may add to the plaintiff\'s injuries, are a foreseeable consequence of the original action and will not break the chain of causation. The facts clearly state that the pedestrian would not have lost her balance had she not been on crutches as the result of being hit by the driver. Because it is foreseeable that walking on crutches would make the pedestrian less stable on her feet and more vulnerable to subsequent injury from falling, the driver is the proximate (legal) cause of both injuries (although responsibility for the broken arm alone may be apportioned between the driver and the supermarket as concurrent tortfeasors). Thus A is incorrect.\r\n\r\nC and D are incorrect. The supermarket will not be liable for both injuries because the injuries are clearly divisible, and the supermarket\'s negligence is the factual and legal cause of only the broken arm.

The prima facie case for IIED has four elements: (1) an act by the defendant of extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) intent on the part of the defendant to cause severe emotional distress, or recklessness as to the effect of the defendant\'s conduct; (3) causation; and (4) damages in the form of severe emotional distress. D is correct because a false statement of fact, broadcast with actual malice, would satisfy both the first and second elements of the prima facie case for IIED. Actual malice is defined as making a false statement with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity. Broadcasting a false statement of fact without regard for its veracity would not only be extreme and outrageous conduct for a news station, it would also show a reckless disregard for the effect of broadcasting the false statements.

(1088, 1, 21, 'A man rented a car from a car rental agency. Unbeknownst to the rental agency, the car had a bomb hidden in it at the time of the rental.

The rental agency did not inspect for hidden explosive devices, but such an inspection would have revealed the bomb. \r\n\r\nThere had been no previous incidents of persons hiding bombs in rental cars. \r\n\r\nIn a negligence action by the man against the car rental agency, is the man likely to prevail?', 'Answer A is correct. The standard to be applied in a negligence action is whether the defendant acted with ordinary care. The presence of a bomb in a rental car is sufficiently unlikely that a reasonable rental agency would not routinely inspect for such a device. In the absence of evidence that the agency should have foreseen that there might be a bomb hidden in the car, the man cannot prove a negligence claim.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. Under some circumstances, the rental agency could be liable even though it did not hide the bomb. If it were reasonably foreseeable that a bomb might be planted in a rental car (for example, because that practice had become a common terrorist tactic in the area), a reasonably prudent rental agency would routinely search for such a device before renting out the car. In that situation, even though the agency did not hide a bomb itself, it would be liable for failing to take reasonable precautions. In this case, the agency will not be liable to the man, because it took all reasonable precautions under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Even if an untaken precaution (such as an inspection for explosive devices) would have revealed a danger, the defendant in a negligence action is responsible only for taking those precautions that are reasonably necessary. An bomb has a high potential for inflicting serious injury, but in most cases it is so unlikely to be found in a rental car that the time and effort needed for a routine search for bombs would not be justified. If incidents involving bombs in rental cars began to occur, that calculation might change, but in this case, the agency will not be liable to the man, because it took all reasonable precautions under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. The car may well have become abnormally dangerous once the bomb was planted, but the agency did not intentionally engage in an abnormally dangerous activity. Moreover, even if the court decided that the agency had engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity, that conclusion would support strict liability, not negligence.

In this jurisdiction, the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence have been replaced by a pure comparative negligence rule.\r\n\r\nIn his action against the defendant, will the plaintiff prevail?', 'A is the correct answer. Because all four conclusions start with \"No,\" scrutiny must be directed at the reasoning for why the plaintiff\'s claim cannot prevail against the defendant. The issue here is the defendant\'s duty to known child trespassers (also referred to as the attractive nuisance doctrine). The defendant would be liable for dangers caused by use of the trampoline on his land if he knew or should have known that: (1) children came to his property when the defendant and his family were not home, (2) children played on the trampoline, (3) use of the trampoline would likely cause injury because the children would not realize the danger of using the trampoline without the mats, and (4) the expense of remedying the situation was slight compared to the probability of injury.\r\n\r\nThe facts indicate that while the neighborhood children commonly used the defendant\'s trampoline, the plaintiff was new to the neighborhood and so was unknown to the defendant.

Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 \"for each day\'s work you actually perform in investigating our fire.\" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store\'s president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city\'s reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective\'s investigation, the store\'s employee was convicted of burning the store.

The resolution is an offer of a reward made to the general public. A reasonable interpretation of its words and the circumstances surrounding its broadcast on television indicate that it is inviting anyone to provide the information necessary to arrest and convict. Therefore, an acceptance of this offer made by the city would be any information given that would lead to an arrest of the arsonist.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because the language of the reward and the nature of a reward indicate that performance is invited and not promissory acceptance.

The building\'s large front window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the tenant-landlord lease. The tenant, who was obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases, promptly contracted with a window company to replace the window for $2,000, due 30 days after satisfactory completion of work. The landlord was then unaware of the tenant-window company contract. The window company was aware that the building was under lease, but dealt entirely with the tenant.\r\n\r\nSixty days after the window company\'s satisfactory completion of the window replacement, and prior to the expiration of the tenant\'s lease, the tenant, then insolvent, ceased doing business and vacated the building. In so doing, the tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2,000 security deposit with the landlord. The deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear. The only such damage occurring during the tenant\'s occupancy was the smashed window.

Generally, a party that has made a contract with another cannot later disregard the contract and bring suit in restitution against a third person, even if that third person has received a benefit from the contract. For example, where the window company has conferred a benefit (replaced the glass in the window) pursuant to its contract with the tenant, it normally would not be able to recover in restitution from the landlord. However, sometimes recovery in restitution is possible, especially where the third person (the landlord) has not already paid someone else for the work and the claimant\'s (the window company\'s) avenues to bring suit to enforce the contract have been exhausted. These and other factors suggest that restitution against the landlord would be just in this case: the tenant is insolvent, the landlord collected on a $2,000 deposit that the tenant forfeited because of the broken window, and the fact that the lease expressly contemplated the tenant fixing any damage to the property suggests that the landlord would have requested the work if given the opportunity.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because the landlord made no promise on which the window company relied.

On several occasions, the defendant turned and looked directly at the hecklers with a scowl on his face, but the heckling continued. The defendant wound up as though he was preparing to pitch in the direction of his catcher; however the ball traveled from his hand at high speed, at a 90-degree angle from the line to the catcher and directly toward the hecklers in the stands.

If the directed verdict was granted without considering the evidence of the baseball player\'s intent to cause apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact, then it was granted improperly. If there is evidence of intent to assault, then that intent transfers to battery.

Therefore, the judgment should be reversed and remanded because the jury could find intent to commit an assault on the evidence.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because this fact pattern deals with an intentional tort, not negligence. There is no need to prove that it is reasonably foreseeable hat the ball would travel through the mesh fence.

Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another resulting in either an offensive touching or bodily injury. Battery is also a general intent crime. \"General intent\" is an awareness of all the factors constituting the crime. Voluntary intoxication is not a valid defense to a general intent crime.

The call of the question is a claim for battery, which the plaintiff could show happened in one of two ways: through the battery itself or through transferred intent via assault. A battery is caused by an intentional harmful or offensive contact to the plaintiff\'s person or an extension thereof, without consent or privilege. The actual contact need not be done personally by the defendant as long as the defendant set into motion an action with the purpose or knowledge to a substantial certainty that the offensive or harmful touching would result. The facts indicate that the defendant cut too sharply in front of the plaintiff, but unless the plaintiff can show that the defendant cut in front of her with the intent to cause a harmful or offensive contact, she will not prevail. On the other hand, if the plaintiff can show that the defendant intended to place the plaintiff in apprehension of an immediate harmful or offensive contact by moving sharply in front of the plaintiff, the intent to cause an assault would transfer to the subsequent battery, which would allow the plaintiff to prevail.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Battery requires intent to prevail. B is incorrect. A violation of the rules does not prove intent per se, but could be considered evidence of intent.

In bystander cases, the intent and causation requirements are satisfied if: (1) the plaintiff was present when the severe physical harm occurred to the other person, (2) the plaintiff was a close relative of the injured person, and (3) the defendant knew that the plaintiff was present and a close relative of the injured person. Here, the police officer did not know the father was present during his arrest of the woman; therefore, the officer could not have intended to inflict emotional distress on the father.

Someone overheard their conversation and reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter, the police arrested the diplomat and the woman. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. \r\n\r\nBefore trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity.

The woman then moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her. \r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction has adopted the Model Penal Code version of conspiracy. \r\n\r\nShould the court grant the woman\'s motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her?', 'Answer A is correct. Model Penal Code section 5.03(1) adopts a unilateral interpretation of conspiracy, defining conspiracy as requiring agreement by the defendant but not by two or more persons. The defendant can be convicted of conspiracy regardless of whether the other parties have all been acquitted or were only feigning agreement. In addition, many jurisdictions that require a bilateral conspiracy still allow conviction if one of the co-conspirators agreed to the crime but cannot be convicted based on lack of capacity or some other defense personal to the co-conspirator. Thus, Answer A is correct because the diplomat\'s defense will not negate the fact that the woman agreed to commit burglary. Answer C is incorrect because, as stated above, under the Model Penal Code\'s unilateral approach to conspiracy, a defendant may be found guilty of conspiracy even if the other conspirators are all acquitted or assert valid personal defenses. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect.

The woman properly can be convicted because, regardless of the diplomat\'s immunity, she agreed to commit a crime.

Generally, all contractual rights may be assigned. At common law, requirements and output contracts were not assignable. Under Article 2 of the UCC, however, requirements and output contracts are assignable as long as the assignee does not disproportionately alter the contemplated quantity. Here, this contract is governed by Article 2, as it is for the sale of goods. The miller tendered the first installment in compliance with the original contract between the flour wholesaler and the baked goods producer. Therefore, the baked goods producer must accept the goods.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. A party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract. Although assignment of a requirements contract may potentially affect the burden of the seller in certain cases (such as where the assignee has substantially different requirements than the assignor), courts will still uphold the assignment of such contracts because the UCC rules on requirements contracts impose reasonably objective standards of good faith in specifying requirements. In any event, the assignment to the miller, will not have such an effect, because the party assigning its contract is the seller. Because the miller is comparable to the flour wholesaler in terms of reputation and experience, the baked goods producer should not have a particular interest in having the flour wholesaler perform the contract.

The plant burns lignite, a low grade fuel which is available in large quantities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way the utility company can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50 percent while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20 percent. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment.\r\n\r\nThe plant was located in a sparsely settled rural area, remote from the large city served by the utility company.\r\n\r\nA farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had farmed the land for forty years and lived on the premises. The prevailing winds carried fumes from the new plant over the farmer\'s land. His 2006 crop was less than half the average size of this crop over the five years immediately preceding the construction of the plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the crop reduction.\r\n\r\nThe farmer\'s hay fever, from which he had long suffered, became worse in 2006. Physicians advised him that the lignite fumes were affecting it and that serious lung disease would soon result unless he moved away from the plant. He did so, selling his farm at its reasonable market value, which was then $10,000 less than before the construction of the plant.\r\n\r\nIf the farmer asserts a claim based on nuisance against the utility company for damages for personal injuries, will the farmer prevail?', 'C is correct. The fumes created by the plant are a public nuisance because they unreasonably interfere with the property rights of the community. A private person may recover for a public nuisance only if he has suffered unique damage not suffered by the public. The farmer has suffered unique damages due to the exacerbation of his hay fever to the point where he would develop a serious lung disease. Therefore, his personal injuries are within the scope of liability imposed on the utility company.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because the balancing of competing interests is only done when injunctive relief from the nuisance is sought. The farmer is only seeking damages, so the impracticality of reducing fumes is irrelevant to the analysis. B is incorrect because although this is a public nuisance, the farmer\'s unique damages allow him to bring suit. D is incorrect. An activity may be characterized as ultra-hazardous if it involves a substantial risk of serious harm to persons or property no matter how much care is exercised.

Because the charge of statutory rape is meant to protect minor children, and the girlfriend is a member of the protected class, the girlfriend cannot be charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit statutory rape. Because it is impossible for the girlfriend to commit the crime, she cannot be a conspirator to the crime, and the boyfriend\'s conviction for conspiracy should be reversed.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because a conspiracy charge not only requires that there be an agreement, but also that both parties be capable of committing the offense. Because the girlfriend cannot be a conspirator to statutory rape, the boyfriend cannot be convicted of conspiring with her.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because Wharton\'s rule only applies in cases where the crime to be committed is one that, by definition requires the voluntary concerted criminal participation of two persons.

The issue here is the company\'s duty to known child trespassers (sometimes called the attractive nuisance doctrine). The company is subject to liability to the children for dangers caused by an artificial condition on its land because the company (1) knew that the children played on the chute by removing the plywood, (2) knew the children would slide down to the street below, (3)knew that the children would not realize that sliding into a street could be dangerous, and (4) the activity posed a high risk of harm to the children compared to the slight burden of eliminating the danger.

The buyer instead sued the seller in court.\r\n\r\nIn that suit, which of the following arguments best supports the seller\'s position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration?', 'Answer C is correct. Because the buyer\'s offer was silent as to arbitration, the arbitration provision in the seller\'s acknowledgment should be characterized as an additional term. Under UCC Â§ 2-207(2), an additional term is considered a proposal for addition to the contract. Section 2-207(2) also provides that an additional term becomes a term of the parties\' contract unless certain specified circumstances are present. One such circumstance is where an additional term materially alters the parties\' contract. Because none of the other circumstances appear applicable here, the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties\' contract. Thus, Answer C is correct. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Even assuming that arbitration is a more efficient dispute resolution mechanism, arbitration\'s relative efficiency is not the governing standard for assessing whether the arbitration provision became a term of the parties\' agreement.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. The question as to whether the arbitration provision did or did not contradict an express term of the offer is not the appropriate standard for determining whether the provision became a term of the parties\' contract. As stated above, the correct standard is whether the seller\'s acknowledgement should be characterized as an additional term.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect.

Under UCC Â§ 2-207, the presence of an additional term--the arbitration provision in the seller\'s acknowledgment--did not give rise to a counteroffer. Rather, a contract was formed, and the arbitration provision constituted a proposal for an addition to the contract.

Even though, in his delusions, he thought it was necessary to save the world, he still intended to kill his wife, so he did have the requisite mental state for murder. Answer B is incorrect because the defendant did meet the requisite act element; he caused her death by pushing her down the steps. Answer D is incorrect because belief alone that he was acting in defense of the planet is insufficient to justify killing his wife. That belief, and the force used, must be reasonable. In light of the unreasonableness of the defendant\'s delusions that his wife was going to destroy the world, the defendant\'s defense of others claim would probably fail.

The subject matter of the option, five acres of a 100-acre farm, was not identified with reasonable specificity and as such was vague and unenforceable. A is incorrect because separate consideration is not necessary to support an option that is a term under an existing contract, such as the five-year lease agreement between the landowner and the farmer. The option is simply considered one of the rights purchased by the lessee under the lease and is also supported by the $2,000 yearly consideration paid by the farmer. C is incorrect. The landowner\'s oral promise to survey the land was a promise to perform an act, and this promise was not made a condition precedent to the farmer\'s duty to pay.

A charge of solicitation is completed once the person invites, requests, commands, hires, or encourages another to commit a particular offense with the intent that the offense be committed. In this case, the man is guilty of the solicitation when he requested that the undercover officer kill his girlfriend\'s parents.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the man\'s attempt to withdraw was done after the solicitation occurred. His later withdrawal is not a valid defense to his original solicitation. Answer B is incorrect because the only act necessary for a solicitation charge is the request to commit the crime; it is not necessary that the crime actually be committed or that steps be taken to commit the crime. Answer D is incorrect because the solicited party does not need to agree to commit the offense for the solicitation to be completed.

The most serious offense for which the man could properly be convicted of is murder. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought exists where the defendant acted with one of the following mental states: (i) intent to kill, (ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii)reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (acting with a \"depraved heart\"), or (iv) intent to commit a felony (felony murder). The man could properly be convicted of murder, even though he lacked specific intent to kill, because his conduct created such a high risk of death and was so devoid of social utility that he could be found to have acted with a depraved heart. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter is a killing that would otherwise be murder but for the existence of an adequate provocation. Here, the man could not properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter because there was no adequate provocation for his conduct, Furthermore, this answer is incorrect because he could be convicted of the more serious offense of depraved heart murder. \r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. It is true that the man could properly be convicted of involuntary manslaughter but this answer is incorrect because he could also be convicted of the more serious offense of depraved heart murder. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect.

An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to interpret an ambiguity in the writing. The department store seeks to introduce in litigation extrinsic evidence of a prior oral agreement by the computer programming company to coordinate its computer program with the department store\'s methods of accounting. Since the written memo between the parties is silent with respect to this issue, the evidence should be admissible so long as the writing is found to be partially and not completely integrated.

A stand-alone claim for emotional distress requires a negligent act (1) that results in a personally witnessed injury to a close family member (such as parent & child), or (2) where the plaintiff had been within the \"zone of danger\" for injury himself. Certainly in this case, the homeowner witnessed the near injury to his own child and then his own near injury. In both cases, however, there was no actual physical injury.

To prevail in a claim for medical malpractice (negligence), the patient must prove the elements of duty, breach, causation, and damages. Standard of care is generally established through the expert testimony of a fellow practitioner in the same field of medicine, according to local or national \"school of practice\" standards. The critical issue in this question is whether the lack of a cardiology review is the cause in fact and the legal cause of the injury the patient suffered. There can be no claim for negligence if there is no injury. Likewise, a failure to observe a medical standard is irrelevant if it did not result in an injury. Thus A is incorrect. Therefore, to prevail in her claim, the patient will need to establish, through expert testimony, both the surgeon\'s duty (via appropriate medical standards for his profession and the procedure in question), the medical standard of care, and the fact that the surgeon\'s breach of that specific standard caused the patient\'s stroke. The practice of medicine does not infer malpractice if the patient does not recover as hoped; there must be proof of a medical standard that was breached, resulting in a chain of causation to the injury.

(1177, 1, 19, 'The defendant became intoxicated at a bar. He got into his car and drove away. Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped his car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, the defendant turned and struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, the defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street.\r\n\r\nRelevant statutes define burglary to include \"breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein.\" Manslaughter is defined as the \"killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner.\" Criminal recklessness is \"consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor\'s conduct.\" Murder is defined as the \"the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another during the commission of a rape, robbery, burglary, or arson.\" Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to crime unless it negates an element of the offense.\r\n\r\nThe defendant was charged with the murder of the watchman and manslaughter in the death of the pedestrian. Assume that he is tried separately on each charge.\r\n\r\nAt the defendant\'s trial for the murder of the watchman, the court should in substance charge the jury on the issue of the defense of intoxication that', 'The correct answer is A. The defendant is charged with murder, which means the state must prove either 1) the defendant premeditated and intentionally killed the watchman, or, 2) the murder occurred in the commission of a burglary. As the statute outlines, intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense. Therefore, intoxication would be available as a defense to the burglary charge if it negated the element that the defendant had the intent to commit a theft when he broke and entered the building. Since there are two ways for the jury to possibly find the defendant guilty of murder, the jury must be instructed that the felony-murder way of charging would be unproven if they believed that the defendant was not guilty, by reason of his intoxication, of the burglary, AND the jury must be instructed that, if they so find, the state must prove the defendant premeditated and intentionally killed the watchman. Thus, answer A is correct. The statute regarding intoxication, which controls over common law, indicates it could be a defense to the specific intent crime of burglary, so the jury must be instructed as to the possibility of that defense on the underlying charge of burglary. Without the underlying felony burglary charge, the defendant cannot be found guilty of felony murder.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. The jury, as fact finders, could easily find that the defendant did kill the watchman in the course of the commission of burglary, despite his intoxication, and so they must be instructed as to the availability of the felony murder charge. Answer C ignores the felony-murder method of committing murder and is thus incorrect. Answer D misstates the requirements for the intoxication defense by applying a \"but for\" test rather than the statutory requirements. When the jury is instructed, they must be allowed to consider both methods of committing the offense of murder and that intoxication is a defense to the burglary charge which, in turn, could negate the felony-murder charge.', '2017-10-29 06:00:55', 1, '[\"intoxication is a defense to the underlying crime of burglary if the defendant, due to drunkenness, did not form an intent to commit a crime within the building, in which case there can be no conviction for murder unless the defendant intentionally and with premeditation killed the watchman.\",\"voluntary intoxication is not a defense to the crime of murder.\",\"The defendant is guilty of murder despite his intoxication only if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing of the watchman was premeditated and intentional.\",\"voluntary intoxication is a defense to the crime of murder if the defendant would not have killed the watchman but for his intoxication.\"]', 0, 'Homicide'),

By reasonable safety criteria, the building\'s foundation required a minimum excavation of 25 feet. When the contract was made, neither the property owner nor the builder was aware of the subsurface granite, for the presence of which neither party had hired a qualified expert to test.\r\n\r\nClaiming accurately that removal of enough granite to permit the construction as planned would cost him an additional $3 million and a probable net loss on the contract of $2 million, the builder refused to proceed with the work unless the property owner would promise to pay an additional $2.5 million for the completed building.\r\n\r\nIf the property owner refuses and sues the builder for breach of contract, which of the following will the court probably decide?', 'Answer C is correct. Generally, a contract may be rescinded due to mutual mistake of fact if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract and has a material effect on the exchange. This holds true unless the court determines that the party asserting mistake should bear the risk of the mistake. Here, the builder is engaged in the business of excavation and had the opportunity to investigate the condition of the ground.

In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision.\r\n\r\nIn an action for breach of contract brought by the niece against her aunt, is the niece likely to prevail?', 'Answer D is correct. Manifestations of assent are sufficient to conclude an enforceable contract even though parties manifest intent to memorialize their agreement in a writing that is not subsequently prepared. Here, the parties\' agreement on essential terms constituted the manifestation of mutual assent sufficient to create an enforceable contract. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The niece\'s promise to pay $125,000 and the aunt\'s promise to sell the business constituted the requisite consideration to enforce the agreement. The fact that the aunt\'s promise to sell her business may have been induced, in part, by affection for her niece would not negate the existence of a bargained-for exchange between the niece and the aunt.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. If a bargained-for exchange is present, there is no additional requirement, such as an equivalency of exchange, in order to satisfy the consideration requirement of an enforceable contract. The niece\'s promise to pay $125,000 and the aunt\'s promise to sell her business constituted consideration. In addition, the niece\'s promise to pay $125,000 for a business appraised at $200,000 does not constitute the gross inadequacy of exchange that so shocks the conscience as to warrant invalidating the agreement.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Conditions are often beyond the control of either party.

The neighbor\'s house sits on a hill and the neighbor can see the lake from his living room window.\r\n\r\nThe homeowner and the neighbor got into an argument and the homeowner erected a large spotlight on his property that automatically comes on at dusk and goes off at sunrise. The only reason the homeowner installed the light was to annoy the neighbor. The glare from the light severely detracts from the neighbor\'s view of the lake.\r\n\r\nIn a suit by the neighbor against the homeowner, will the neighbor prevail?', 'A is the correct answer because the neighbor will most likely be able to get an injunction requiring the homeowner to remove the large spotlight, or at least to redirect its beam. Private nuisance is defined as a condition or activity that substantially interferes with the possessor\'s use and enjoyment of his land to such an extent that the landowner cannot reasonably be expected to bear the condition without compensation. The standard of interference is generally personal discomfort to the occupants or tangible harm to property, resulting in a diminution of its market value. Nuisance does not require proof of negligence, only interference. Where the nuisance cannot be removed without undue burden, and the nuisance has utility, damages for the reduction in property value of the affected plaintiff may be ordered. In this situation, the neighbor\'s use and enjoyment of his property is severely affected by the spotlight. Because the facts indicate that the spotlight has no utility other than as a means to harass the neighbor, an injunction will be available as a remedy instead of damages. A is the best choice because it describes facts that remove the issue of utility from the equation, allowing the neighbor an injunction to remove the nuisance entirely.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. An answer choice that includes the language \"but only because\" is rarely the correct answer because it is too restrictive.

The nuisance does not have to be continuous to substantially interfere with the neighbor\'s use and enjoyment of his property.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect.

Hoping to avoid such encounters, the architect, without the sculptor\'s knowledge, assigned to a newly-licensed architect practicing solo, \"all of my rights and duties under my design and construction supervision contract with the sculptor.\" The newly-licensed architect expressly promised the renowned architect to carry out the work to the best of her ability.\r\n\r\nAssume that the sculptor allowed the newly-licensed architect to proceed with the design work but that the newly-licensed architect, without legal excuse, abandoned the project shortly after construction began.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following legal conclusions are correct?', 'Answer A is correct. The renowned architect is liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by the newly-licensed architect\'s default because when a party delegates duties under a contract with the consent of the obligee (the sculptor), it does not result in a complete substitution of the delegatee (the newly-licensed architect) for the delegator (the renowned architect). The architect cannot unilaterally release himself from his obligation to the sculptor, and remains liable for the newly-licensed architect\'s failure to perform or defective performance.\r\n\r\nThe newly-licensed architect is liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by her default because a delegatee (the newly-licensed architect) becomes liable to the obligee (the sculptor) if the delegatee makes a promise to either the obligee or the delegator (the renowned architect) to perform under the contract, and the newly-licensed architect \"expressly promised the architect\" to perform.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sculptor is not indebted to the newly-licensed architect for a prorated portion of the agreed $25,000 architect\'s fee promised to the renowned architect.

A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a crime to \"enter the property of another with the intent to commit any crime of violence thereon.\"\r\n\r\nIf charged with attempting to violate the statute, the man should be found', 'The correct answer is C. To be found guilty of attempt to commit a crime, one must have the intent that the crime be committed and take a substantial step towards its commission. In this question, the statutory crime is to enter the property of another with the intent to commit any crime of violence thereon. The question indicates that the man clearly had the intent to shoot the poker player, and the man clearly had the intent to enter the poker player\'s property to do so. Obtaining the weapon and going over to the poker player\'s house are substantial steps towards the commission of the statutory offense. The man intended to enter the poker player\'s property in order to cause violence and took substantial steps toward the commission of that offense; thus, he should be convicted of attempt to commit the offense.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the crime listed in the statute punishes the entry of property with the intent to commit a crime of violence. The statute does not define an attempt crime. It is a crime of its own, separate and apart from any other attempt to commit violence and is defined by the action of entering property of another with the requisite mental state.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect because the attempt to commit the statutory offense does not punish the defendant simply for having a guilty mind. The defendant must also take substantial steps towards the commission of the offense. There is an actus reus requirement for all attempt charges, including this offense. In this case, the man\'s obtaining the gun and setting out for the poker player\'s house were sufficient actions for a conviction of attempt.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect because the policy behind the statute and the dangerousness of the man are not sufficient reasons to convict the man of a crime.

The man attempted to take the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, by the threat of force. The man had the intent to commit a robbery, and took substantial steps, by putting his hand in his pocket and threatening the attendant, toward the commission of that robbery. Although it was factually impossible for the man to have committed robbery, because the attendant was not afraid and gave the money to the man out of sympathy rather than because of force or the threat of force, factual impossibility is not a defense to an attempt charge. The man committed attempted robbery.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the man did not commit a robbery. The attendant did not give the man the money because of force or the threat of force, but rather because he felt sorry for the man. A conviction for robbery requires the money be given due to force or the threat of force, and not because of sympathy.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, at common law, false pretenses requires the obtaining of the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation. Regardless of whether the check was properly endorsed, the man did not obtain the money through fraud, but rather through the sympathy of the attendant. Therefore, he did not commit false pretenses.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect for the same reason.

The owner\'s manual that came with the car stated that \"continuous driving over 90 miles per hour requires high-speed-capability tires,\" but the manual did not describe the speed capability of the tires sold with the car.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff took her new car out for a spin on a straight, smooth country road where the posted speed limit was 55 miles per hour.

This would make the car unreasonably dangerous and strict liability may be applied if, as in this case, the manufacturer failed to give a proper warning as to the type of tires needed for the car to be driven at its higher speeds. The duty to warn will create strict liability despite the plaintiff\'s prolonged use of the car at a high speed because its use at that high speed was a foreseeable use, given its design and marketing.

A person\'s nondisclosure of fact may be tantamount to a misrepresentation of fact sufficient to allow rescission of a contract where the person knows that disclosure of the fact would correct the other party\'s mistake with respect to a basic assumption of the contract, and where nondisclosure amounts to a failure to act in good faith. The fact that the horse earned $400,000 for the trainer soon after the sale (over 250 times the contract price) suggests that nondisclosure of the horse\'s true abilities related to a basic assumption of the contract relating to the horse\'s worth. If the son can establish that the trainer was aware that the horse was capable of running a race in record-setting time and that the son was ignorant of this fact, then the son has a plausible argument for rescission on grounds of nondisclosure. A and C are incorrect because neither the son\'s ignorance of the horse trainer\'s expertise nor the son\'s inexperience with evaluating horses alone would be sufficient to establish a basis for rescission.

Ybarra v. Spangard and cases that follow its approach have relied on this extension of res ipsa loquitur to establish causation in situations in which the plaintiff was treated by a medical team that, as a group, had exclusive control of the patient and in which the patient, because she was unconscious, cannot identify what went wrong. The doctrine may be limited to medical cases in which there may be a concern that none of the medical professionals would be willing to testify against another. Thus, Answer A is correct.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. \"Acting in concert\" refers to jointly engaging in negligent activity. There is no evidence here that the mishap that caused the injury was the result of any joint negligent activity; a single actor may have caused the burn.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Even though the plaintiff can establish that there was negligence by someone, she must also establish that the defendants caused her injury. It is proof that the defendants caused the injury that seems to be lacking here. Evidence that the standard of care was breached establishes that someone was negligent, but it does not establish that all the defendants or any particular defendant was responsible. The plaintiff must make an additional argument that would either establish causal responsibility or justify loosening the normal requirement that cause be established.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. In Ybarra v. Spangard, the court rested its decision to hold the group of medical professionals liable in part on the fact that the patient was unconscious during his treatment. That meant that the patient was clearly not responsible for his own injury and that he was not in a position to identify what went wrong.

The common law felony murder doctrine applies to inherently dangerous felonies, including arson, burglary, rape, robbery, kidnapping, etc. Fraud is not an inherently dangerous felony, and therefore, cannot serve as a basis for a felony-murder conviction.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect because conspiracy is not an underlying offense recognized by the felony murder doctrine (which traditionally recognizes arson, burglary, rape, robbery, kidnapping, etc. to be qualifying underlying inherently dangerous offenses).

The deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear.

Under rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked \"payment in full.\" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the modification, however, unless the amount owed to the creditor is not liquidated (i.e., genuinely in dispute).

The difference in answers reflects the different ways trespassing cattle have been treated in jurisdictions across the United States. Many courts today allow a plaintiff to assert her claim under either a negligence theory or a strict liability theory, or both.\r\n\r\nSome states required landowners bordering cattle grazing lands to erect fences by passing \"fence-out\" statutes; as a result, those states would only hold the cattle owner liable for intentionally driving his cattle onto the land of another, but not for strict liability or negligence. Choice C addresses the fact pattern statement that the neighbor was not required to erect a fence to prevent intrusions by cattle, leading to the inference that the farmer was required to do so.\r\n\r\nOther states required cattle owners to protect crop-growers from cattle trespass, giving rise to strict liability. Choice A reflects the common law response to a livestock trespass.\r\n\r\nChoice B is incorrect. Despite the fact that the Restatement (Second) classifies cattle as domestic animals, thus making the farmer liable only for an intentional tort or ordinary negligence, strict liability would still be imposed upon the farmer for a foreseeable harm resulting from a known (by the farmer), abnormally dangerous propensity by his cattle.

When a statute specifically names only one party as being criminally liable when there must be at least 2 or more actors to commit the offense, there is a clear indication that the legislature did not intend the other actor to be punished, and a court will not hold that other actor criminally liable. That is the student\'s best argument for a dismissal here. Answer C is correct.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect; a principal and an accessory can be tried together, and an accessory can be convicted without the principal even being charged.

Thus, Answer C is correct.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Because the defendant killed the neighbor, the crime would not be attempted murder but would be either murder or manslaughter. Whether the defendant is guilty of murder or manslaughter depends on whether he fired the third shot in the heat of passion provoked by the neighbor\'s earlier attack.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. It is true that the defendant could properly be convicted of manslaughter. However, he could also be convicted of murder if the jury finds that he did not fire the third shot in the heat of passion.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. The defendant was not in imminent fear of the neighbor, and therefore was not acting in self-defense, when he fired the third shot.

Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 \"for each day\'s work you actually perform in investigating our fire.\" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store\'s president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city\'s reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective\'s investigation, the store\'s employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city\'s repealer before claiming its reward.\r\n\r\nIn a suit by the detective against the city to recover the $10,000 reward, which of the following, in light of the facts given, most usefully supports the detective\'s claim?', 'Answer B is correct. If the reward were characterized as a government bounty, the detective\'s knowledge of the reward after obtaining the confession and the earlier attempted revocation would not be determinative.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because although the city benefited, the detective had no reasonable expectation of payment from the city due to his lack of knowledge of the offer, the prior revocation, and the fact that his expectation of payment was from the huge store. C is incorrect. The city was free to revoke the offer for any reason so long as the city revoked by means of general notification equal to that given to the offer.

The pedestrian sued the owner for damages for his injuries.\r\n\r\nWill the pedestrian prevail in his claim against the owner?', 'D is the correct answer. The injured person was not a guest, but a passerby, so the principle that innkeepers are liable for slight negligence does not apply to this situation. Instead, the pedestrian was a licensee, so the owner had a duty to exercise reasonable care in conducting active operations. Because the hotel employees took reasonable precautions against injury to a passerby, the owner will not be found liable.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The strict liability standard does not apply to active operations unless the activity being performed is ultra-hazardous (such as demolition or the storage of hazardous waste).

In return, the client agreed to pay the architect a fee of $10,000 to be paid upon the house\'s completion. After completion, the client claimed erroneously but in good faith that the architect\'s plans were defective. The client orally offered to pay the architect $7,500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10,000. The client paid the architect $7,500 pursuant to their agreement.\r\n\r\nThe architect subsequently sued the client for the remaining $2,500. In a preliminary finding, the trier of fact found that there were no defects in the architect\'s plans.\r\n\r\nWill the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the client for $2,500?', 'Answer C is correct. An accord occurs when one party to a contract agrees to accept performance different from the performance promised in the original agreement. An accord generally requires >consideration, which can be less than that called for in the original contract. Payment of a lesser amount than is due on a valid claim constitutes valid consideration if there is a bona fide dispute as to the amount owed, and the dispute is made in good faith. Satisfaction is the performance of the accord, and it discharges both the accord and the original debt. \r\n\r\nThe architect\'s agreement to accept a payment for less than the amount due constituted an effective accord, supported by consideration, which was satisfied with the payment of $7,500. Consideration is present because of the good faith dispute as to the amount owed. By compromising, each party surrenders its respective claim as to how much is owed. Thus, Answer C is correct. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The rule of Foakes v. Beer, which is a specific application of the pre-existing duty rule, provides that part payment of a liquidated debt is invalid for a lack of consideration. The rule does not apply, however, where there is a compromise of a claim disputed in good faith. This exception applies even if it later becomes apparent that the reason for disputing the claim was invalid. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. The statute of frauds is removed as a defense when an oral agreement is fully performed. Moreover, the dispositive issue is whether consideration exists to enforce the agreement to settle the claim, which it does in a compromise of a claim disputed in good faith, regardless of the reason for the dispute. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. A novation arises where either one or both of the parties to a contract is replaced by a third party. The architect\'s acceptance of payment does not constitute a novation since neither the client nor the architect was replaced by a third party.

The mechanic then completed the work.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following, if true, would best serve the owner as a defense in an action brought against him by the creditor for $5,000?', 'Answer B is correct. The mechanic was not entitled to payment unless he satisfied his contractual duties. Every contract for work or services contains an implied duty to perform in good faith or in a workmanlike manner. The mechanic would still have to perform his obligations in good faith and in a workmanlike manner for owner to be obligated to pay. Payment then may be made to the creditor because the mechanic had assigned his rights under the contract to the creditor.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the mechanic was not delegating his duties to the creditor under the contract; he was assigning his right to payment. The mechanic was still obligated to perform the work. Answer C is incorrect. Generally, all contractual rights may be assigned with some exceptions. Even a clause in the contract prohibiting the assignment of contractual rights does not in fact bar assignment. The assignor still has the power to assign, but not the right. Although, the consequence of such a clause does give the obligator the right to sue for breach if an assignment is made, the assignment is still effective.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Even though the creditor is not an intended beneficiary, he still has contract rights against the owner. This is an assignment, which is different than a third party beneficiary situation. The difference is, in a third party beneficiary situation, the original contract will confer the rights and duties on the third party. However, in an assignment the original contract does not confer any rights or obligations on the third party, but subsequently one of the parties has transferred his rights under the contract to the third party (assignment).

If the painter had started to paint on the following Saturday morning, he could have finished before Sunday evening. However, he stayed home that Saturday morning to watch the final game of the World Series on TV and did not start to paint until Saturday afternoon. By late Saturday afternoon, the painter realized that he had underestimated the time it would take to finish the work over the weekend unless he hired a helper.

The woman told the painter that she apparently had no choice but to pay \"whatever it takes\" to get the work done as scheduled.\r\n\r\nThe painter hired a friend to help finish the painting and paid the friend $200.

The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.\r\n\r\nWas the escrow agreement a valid modification?', 'A is correct. The escrow agreement is valid as a subsequent oral modification. The agreement is not governed by the UCC because the contract is predominantly a services contract for developing software. Therefore, section 2-209(2) of the UCC, which expressly makes a \"no oral modification\" clause enforceable, does not apply. Instead, under common law, a contract provision stating that all future modifications must be made in writing is not an effective bar to subsequent oral modification. Furthermore, since this is a services contract that can be completed within a year, the Statute of Frauds does not apply. The other issue is a lack of consideration for the creation of the escrow account. Generally, the performance of a preexisting legal duty is not valid consideration. However, since there was an honest dispute about the legal duty owed, the escrow agreement would be exempt from the consideration requirement. Therefore, the escrow account is a valid modification.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. This is a misstatement of the law. The Statute of Frauds will apply to a subsequent oral modification if the modified contract falls under the Statute of Frauds.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect.

At common law, a defendant could be convicted of murder not only for an intentional killing but also for causing another\'s death by actions intended to cause serious bodily injury short of death.

This question involves the rights and duties of third parties to a contract. A third-party beneficiary is a person who is not a party to a contract, but has the legal right to enforce the contract or share in the proceeds because the contract was made for the third party\'s benefit. Only intended third-party beneficiaries have contract rights. Whether a person is an intended beneficiary depends on the intent of the parties. Here, the woman is an intended third-party beneficiary because the father agreed to pay the physician for her treatment. Therefore, she can bring an action against the physician for breach of contract. The physician, the promisor, is allowed the same defenses against the woman, the third party. as he would be against the father, the promisee.\r\n\r\nThe physician may assert that the father materially breached the contract by failing to pay any of the woman\'s medical bills up to that point. A material breach occurs when the obligee does not receive the substantial benefit of the bargain as a result of the failure to perform or a defective performance. In this case, the father failed to perform by not paying any of the woman\'s medical bills and so materially breached the contract. The nonbreaching party (i) may treat the contract as being discharged, and (ii) will have an immediate right to all remedies for breach of the entire contract. Therefore, the physician would be allowed to discontinue treatment of the woman.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is not an effective defense because there was bargained-for consideration provided by another party. It is immaterial that the consideration was provided by the father instead of the beneficiary (the woman). Thus, answer A is incorrect. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is not an effective defense. Although the woman was not a party to the contract between the father and the physician, she is an intended third-party beneficiary. The woman can enforce the contract because her rights as an intended third-party beneficiary vested when she assented to the promise by seeking treatment from the physician. Thus, answer B is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is not an effective defense because a novation is an express agreement by all parties to substitute a new party for an original party to a contract.

Such a promise is an illusory promise. However, where a promisor\'s obligation is conditioned upon the occurrence of an event that is outside of the promisor\'s control, the mere fact that the obligation is subject to a condition does not render the promise illusory.

If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties\' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the flood was an act of God that related to a basic assumption of the agreement to repair the homeowner\'s house, it operated to excuse any resulting delay in completing the requested work. Whether or not the delay was sufficiently severe to discharge the parties\' remaining obligations under the contract depends on whether circumstances have so changed that performance will become materially more burdensome than the agreed-upon performance.

The homeowner told the contractor to stop working immediately. The reasonable market value of the labor and materials provided by the contractor at that point, including the oak flooring, was $40,000. The contractor used the oak flooring on another job. \r\n\r\nIn an action by the contractor against the homeowner for damages, which of the following would be the largest amount of damages recoverable by the contractor?', 'Answer C is correct. $50,000 represents the contractor\'s expectation measure of recovery and gives the contractor the benefit of the bargain-this amount would place the contractor in the position he would have been in but for the breach. It is also the greatest amount the contractor is able to recover. The general expectation formula permits the contractor to recover $50,000 and can be computed as follows:\r\n\r\nGeneral expectation formula = loss in value + other loss - cost avoided - loss avoided: \r\n\r\nLIV = the difference between the performance the nonbreaching party should have received under the contract and what was actually received, if anything, in this case, $300,000 less $0 \r\n\r\n\r\nOL = consequential and incidental damages, if any, in this case, $0 \r\n\r\n\r\nCA = the additional costs the nonbreaching party can avoid by rightfully discontinuing performance under the contract as a result of the other party\'s breach, in this case, $290,000 less $45,000\r\n\r\n\r\nLA = the beneficial effects of the breach due to the nonbreaching party\'s ability to salvage or reallocate resources that otherwise would have been devoted to performing under the contract, in this case, $5,000\r\n\r\n\r\nSo $300,000 + $0 - $245,000 - $5,000 = $50,000. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The $40,000 figure is an attempt to calculate the contractor\'s restitution recovery, measured by the benefit conferred on the owner, which will yield the smallest amount of recovery. The restitutionary measure would not allow the contractor to recover damages related to the benefit of the bargain. Circumstances are not present that would cause the contractor to seek damages based on the restitution principle and forgo his expectation measure of recovery.

Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§Â§ 371, 347.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. $40,000 represents the contractor\'s reliance measure of recovery and fails to take into account the contractor\'s benefit of the bargain, the profit the contractor anticipated making on the project. Reliance damages are measured based on the contractor\'s unreimbursed expenses for labor and materials, $45,000, less the salvage value of the oak flooring, $5,000, which equals $40,000.

A contract that violates a state statute may be declared unenforceable on grounds of public policy. Where, however, the contract violates a policy that was intended for the benefit of a contracting party seeking relief, the contract may be enforceable in order to avoid frustrating the policy behind the statute. Accordingly, public policy would not prevent the enforcement of the contract by those within the class of persons, including the homeowner, that the statute was intended to protect. Thus, Answer C is correct. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The statement accurately states that the insurance policy is not a divisible contract. The doctrine of divisibility is typically employed to permit a breaching party who is to receive money under the contract to recover a portion of the contract price for having completed a portion of the work. The doctrine of divisibility is not relevant here, because the focus of this question is the enforceability of a contract entered into in violation of a statute. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. Generally, a contract that violates a regulatory statute may be unenforceable as against public policy if the policy against enforcement outweighs the interest of enforcement.

A non-aggressor is justified in using force upon another if she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect herself from imminent use of unlawful force by the other person.

The passenger\'s touch was neither unreasonable nor inconsistent with ordinary social norms privileging such contacts.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. People are presumed to have consented to the ordinary contacts of daily life. Although the passenger intended to touch the woman, he did not intend a harmful or offensive touching, and the woman gave no indication that she did not want to be subjected to the ordinary touches that are part of life in a crowded society. The touch was neither unreasonable nor inconsistent with ordinary social norms privileging such contacts.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Serious injury is neither necessary nor sufficient to support either battery or negligence, although some damage would be required to recover in negligence.

The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier had made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer\'s financial condition was precarious. The supplier called the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer\'s financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed to the supplier its latest audited financial statements as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer\'s banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer has sued the supplier for breach of contract. \r\n\r\nWill the manufacturer likely prevail?', 'Answer C is correct. A party to a contract with reasonable grounds to worry that the other party might not perform can request adequate assurances of performance, pursuant to Uniform Commercial Code Â§ 2-609. The supplier in this case did so, but the information provided by the manufacturer would be regarded as satisfying the request for an assurance of performance. Therefore the supplier\'s refusal to continue performance constituted a breach of contract for which the manufacturer is entitled to compensation.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. A quantity term expressed in terms of a manufacturer\'s requirements is enforceable. Uniform Commercial Code Â§ 2-306 provides that \"a term which measures the quantity by the . . . requirements of the buyer means such actual . . . requirements as may occur in good faith . . . .\" Essentially, the definiteness of quantity requirement is satisfied if there is an available objective method for determining the quantity, and the requirements of a manufacturer would generally satisfy that need. In this case, once the manufacturer provided the supplier with adequate assurance in the form of audited financial statements and a credit report, the supplier was bound to perform under the contract. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. Under Uniform Commercial Code Â§ 2-609, a party to a contract who has reasonable grounds for insecurity is entitled to request assurances, and is also entitled to suspend performance pending receipt of that assurance. A failure to provide an adequate assurance within a reasonable time (not to exceed 30 days) can be treated as a repudiation, which may give rise to a right to terminate the contract. In this case, the supplier was entitled to seek assurance, but once the manufacturer provided the supplier with adequate assurance in the form of audited financial statements and a credit report, the supplier was bound to perform under the contract. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the manufacturer will prevail, but it misstates the reason why this is so. Uniform Commercial Code Â§ 2-609 provides that a party to a contract with reasonable grounds to worry that the other party might not perform can request adequate assurance of performance. In this case, the supplier heard rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer\'s financial condition was insecure. This would be enough to trigger the right to request assurance, and so it is incorrect to assert that the supplier was not entitled to request assurance.

The statutory definition of burglary requires that the man break and enter the building with the intent to commit a felony or steal therein. Since the store was open to the public, there was no breaking committed, which would be the man\'s best defense to a charge of burglary. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The man had cased the store, planned to hold up the store, got a toy gun, and entered the store, all while having the requisite intent to steal from the owner. Any subsequent intent to leave will not be a valid defense to his entry with the intent to steal. Answer C is incorrect; although he quickly changed his mind, the man had the intent to commit a theft when he entered the store. A change in his mind after he entered with the necessary intent would not be a valid defense to the burglary charge. One cannot withdraw from a crime after he has committed it.

At common law, voluntary intoxication can be the basis for a defense to a specific intent crime if the intoxication negated the requisite mens rea of the offense. In this case, the employee is charged with assault and attempted murder, both of which are specific intent crimes. Assault requires the intent to commit a battery or the intent to create a reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm. Attempted murder requires proof that the employee had the intent to kill his boss and took substantial steps toward the commission of the offense. If the employee was unable to form the intent to commit a battery or the intent to commit a murder due to his intoxication, he would have a valid defense to the charge. The evidence of the employee\'s intoxication should be admitted without limitation.\r\n\r\nAnswer B can also be correct because the assault was actually brought to fruition by the commission of the battery. By stabbing his boss, the employee did not merely commit an assault; he committed criminal battery. The charge of assault would thus merge into the battery offense, and the evidence of the intoxication should be admitted only to the attempted murder charge.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because the evidence of intoxication may negate the employee\'s intent to commit the murder and should be admitted for that purpose. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason.

The husband and wife had the \"incomplete\" privilege of private necessity, which allows trespass onto the property of another to avoid a serious threat to life or property, but retains liability for any actual damage caused by the intrusion. The facts place a bull running loose on the road, which qualifies as an emergency sufficient to invoke the necessity privilege.

Answer A addresses the fact that the husband and the wife were on the neighbor\'s property without permission, and acknowledges that, while they are not liable for trespass due to the emergency, they still must compensate the neighbor for any actual damage to his plants that they caused.

Such event may include the destruction or deterioration of a specific thing necessary for the performance of a duty or the necessity to comply with a governmental order. Because the breeder undertook to exhibit his world champion animal(and not any other hog), the animal\'s availability for exhibition is a basic assumption of the contract.

In fact, in early October, before the crop was harvested, it was destroyed by a hailstorm.\r\n\r\nIs the rancher liable for the loss?', 'Answer C is correct. The rules of contract law limit the recoverability of damages for a breach of contract. According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 351, a non-breaching party is entitled to recover damages that the party in breach \"had reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach\" when the parties entered into the contract. Reason to foresee can arise from circumstances that result in the breaching party having had actual or constructive knowledge of the loss that might result from the breach. Therefore, the neighbor\'s failure to specifically inform the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm does not determine whether the loss was foreseeable. Thus, Answer B is incorrect. In this case, the rancher\'s experience and the frequency of hailstorms in the fall combined to make the loss resulting from the rancher\'s breach foreseeable.

Because battery is a general intent crime, the student and his girlfriend are guilty of battery.\r\n\r\nConspiracy to commit battery, on the other hand, is a specific intent crime and requires an agreement to commit the crime of battery.

In the question, the teller, knowing the man to be violent and jealous, lied to him, and suggested he commit murder.

However, the student\'s qualified privilege is lost if his statement exceeds the scope of the privilege.  The law review editor bears the burden of proving the student exceeded his privilege by proving he acted with actual malice.  To prove actual malice, the law review editor must prove fault, not falsity.  The plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted with either: (i) knowledge that the statement was untrue, or (ii) a reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity.  This is not the same as proving the statement is false.  The plaintiff must prove the defendant had a subjective mental state in which he knew the statement was false or that he entertained serious doubts as to its truthfulness.  Because the student knew that the law review editor had written the note herself, B is the best answer.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The objective falsity of the statement is not enough because this student has a qualified privilege.  As stated above, the plaintiff must also prove that the defendant acted with actual malice.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect.  A claim for slander generally requires proof of special or pecuniary damages.  However, the allegation against the law review editor is one of trade or professional misconduct and special damages are presumed.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect.

The player died of loss of blood.\r\n\r\nWhat is the most serious offense of which the defendant could be properly convicted?', 'The correct answer is C. Murder is defined at common law as the unlawful killing of another with malice aforethought. The malice aforethought requirement can be satisfied by an intent to kill, an intent to inflict great bodily harm, reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, or intent to commit certain dangerous felonies. In this question, the defendant acted with the intent to commit great bodily harm, shown by his intent to hospitalize the player for a few weeks. Since the killing was done with malice aforethought, the most serious offense that the defendant can be properly convicted of is murder.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter is a killing that would otherwise be murder but is distinguishable from murder by the existence of adequate provocation. This is often described as a killing in the heat of passion. Here, there was no legally adequate provocation, and the shooting was not done in the sudden heat of passion. Therefore, there is no defense that would mitigate the killing to voluntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Involuntary manslaughter refers to an unintentional killing that results from recklessness or criminal negligence. Here, the defendant intended to shoot the player. Although he did not intend for the player to die, he did intend to cause great bodily harm. The killing was not done pursuant to a lawful act recklessly done, nor does the misdemeanor manslaughter rule apply. Therefore involuntary manslaughter does not apply.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Under felony murder, a killing that occurs in the course of a dangerous felony, even an accidental one, may be charged as first-degree murder. The specific intent required, must be the intent to commit the underlying felony. The felony murder rule can be applied only if the underlying felony is independent of the killing. Thus, felonies such as manslaughter or aggravated battery are not qualifying underlying felonies because they are not a separate offenses. They are included in the same act. Felony murder statutes usually include a list of enumerated felonies which qualify as the base offense. The most common enumerated felonies are arson, rape, burglary, robbery, and kidnapping. Here, the defendant begun by commit an aggravated battery, which turned into a homicide. There is no felony independent of the killing for which felony murder could be charged.', '2017-10-31 19:05:29', 1, '[\"Involuntary manslaughter.\",\"Voluntary manslaughter.\",\"Murder.\",\"Felony murder.\"]', 2, 'Homicide'),

Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility.\r\n\r\nSoon after making its contract with the financier-investor, the winery, without the financier-investor\'s knowledge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its winery to a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of this sale, the agricultural corporation agreed to sell to the winery all grapes grown on the land for five years. The agricultural corporation\'s employees have no experience in winegrape production, and the agricultural corporation has no reputation in the wine industry as a grape producer or otherwise.

The financier-investor relied upon the fact that the winery was famous for its vineyards when the financier-investor entered into the five-year agreement with the winery. The winery was thus not free to delegate its duty of grape production to an inexperienced buyer, because this act of delegation would impair the financier-investor\'s reasonable expectations under the agreement.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. Delegation is permitted unless a contract specifically prohibits delegation, or the nature of the contract is such that the transfer would impair the other party\'s reasonable expectations. C is incorrect. The winery\'s performance will now be directly based upon the agricultural corporation\'s output, and given the agricultural corporation\'s lack of experience with wine grape production, the winery has created a significant risk regarding performance. D is incorrect. Although corporations require individuals to perform duties, when they do so, they are not delegating contractual duties. The individual is acting on behalf of the corporation.

Since this is a shipment contract, the risk of loss would pass from the seller to the buyer when the seller duly delivered the goods to the third-party carrier. Thus, Answer C is correct. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. As stated in UCC Â§ 2-509(1)(b), under a destination contract, the risk of loss shifts from the seller to the buyer when the goods are duly tendered to the buyer rather than when the goods are unloaded. More importantly, however, this is not a destination contract.

The bystander suffered serious emotional distress as a result of his failure to save the pedestrian\'s life, but he experienced no resulting physical manifestations. The bystander brought a negligence action against the driver.\r\n\r\nIs the bystander likely to prevail?', 'Answer B is correct. Individuals have a duty to avoid causing emotional distress in others. That duty is breached when the defendant creates a foreseeable risk of physical injury to the plaintiff. The risk of physical injury is created either by (i) causing a threat of physical impact that leads to emotional distress or (ii) directly causing severe emotional distress that by itself is likely to result in physical symptoms.\r\n\r\nNormally, a plaintiff can recover only if the defendant\'s conduct caused a physical injury to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff\'s distress is caused by threat of physical impact (i.e., if the plaintiff is in the \"zone of danger\" created by the defendant\'s conduct), most courts require that the threat be directed at the plaintiff or someone in his immediate presence. On the contrary, a bystander outside the \"zone of danger\" of physical injury who sees the defendant negligently injuring another cannot recover damages for her own distress. However, some states will allow a bystander to recover based on foreseeability factors rather than a \"zone of danger\" theory if (i) the plaintiff and the person injured by the defendant are closely related, (ii) if the plaintiff was present at the scene, and (iii) if the plaintiff observed or perceived the injury. Therefore, Answer B is correct because even states that allow witnesses who are not in the zone of danger to recover for the emotional distress of observing an accident limit recovery to witnesses who are closely related to the injured person.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. One who negligently injures another is liable to rescuers even when the rescuer voluntarily comes to the aid of the injured person.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect.

This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing.\r\nOn June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After the department store denied liability, the parties orally agreed that the department store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the department store\'s computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by the computer programming company and the department store computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the department store\'s billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would, however, save the department store $12,000 a year. Further, if the department store would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by the computer programming company, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent, saving the department store another $8,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe department store\'s computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion.

There are many ways in which a discharge might arise, in addition to discharges by mutual agreement.

Contract law acknowledges the fact that parties sometimes embody obligations which are in most respects separable into a single document or agreement. The rules for damages permit the separable components to be treated separately, which is appropriate here, since the structures were to be built on separate pieces of land, and there were prices related to each distinct property. Another rationale for the divisibility of obligations is to avoid a forfeiture.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The substantial performance rule doesn\'t apply here, because the obligations were separable, and the builder DID substantially complete the first structure. The builder is likely to recover the agreed price of the first structure, less any recoverable damages caused to the landowner as a result of the builder\'s breach.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect.

Parents have a number of affirmative duties, based on their special relationship to their minor children. This includes the duty to exercise reasonable care in the control of their minor children.

In this case, the woman was aware that her daughter had trouble dealing with younger children and had no experience as a babysitter. It was, therefore, foreseeable that when she recommended her daughter to babysit, the twelve year old would encounter difficulties that she could not handle, which would result in harm to the child she was caring for.

Under the traditional rules, the wife would be required to prove that reasonable action on the part of the hospital (presumably a correct diagnosis) would, more likely than not, have led to the man\'s survival. Here, the wife cannot establish that the chances of the man\'s survival would have been greater than 50% even if he had been given appropriate medical care. A jurisdiction that allows recovery for loss of the chance of survival, however, would allow the wife to recover for the reduction in her husband\'s chance of surviving that was caused by the failure to properly diagnose. \r\n\r\nD is incorrect. Cause in fact is a necessary element of a plaintiff\'s case for loss of spousal consortium, as well as in cases in which a plaintiff is suing for personal injury. In a loss of consortium action, the wife must establish that the hospital\'s negligence was the cause of her husband\'s death.

At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that demonstrate gross recklessness toward human life. In addition, felony murder is the killing of someone during the commission of a violent felony. Arson is defined at common law as the malicious burning of the dwelling of another.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the defendant maliciously burned the clerk\'s dwelling and, during the commission of that arson, caused the clerk\'s death.

First degree murder in this jurisdiction is defined as murder with premeditation and deliberation or homicide in the commission of certain enumerated felonies. First degree murder is also a specific intent crime; therefore, in this jurisdiction first degree premediated murder (as defined by the statute) requires a premeditated intent to kill. All other murders at common law will be second degree murder in this jurisdiction. Deliberate means that the defendant made the decision to kill in a cool and dispassionate manner. Premeditated means that the defendant actually reflected on the idea of killing beforehand, even if only for a brief period. Answer B is the best answer because it contains evidence of both premeditation and deliberation. The acts of going out and buying the poison and putting it in the coffee show a thought out plan with a premeditated intent to kill. The defendant also had sufficient cooling off time to act with deliberation.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is not as good of an answer as Answer B.

This crime would likely be second degree murder or involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect because voluntary intoxication may be a defense to first degree murder. To be a defense, the intoxication must negate the required intent for the crime, which is consequently why voluntary intoxication is only a defense to specific intent crimes.

Because of the unique vulnerabilities of helpless patients, the hospital would have a duty to institute safeguards to protect against sexual assault. Courts have tended to recognize that caretaker institutions of those who are helpless to care for themselves may be considered to have a special relationship, resulting in an affirmative duty to protect their patients. This is the best answer because it addresses the particular problem posed by a severely disabled patient\'s being attacked by a hospital employee in her hospital room.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The potential for employees to take sexual advantage of the disabled is a normal risk of a caretaking business and the duty cannot be delegated.

While some courts have found vicarious liability, others have held that the institution is only under a duty of care to protect its residents from foreseeable sexual assault.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The call of the question states that a claim was brought on the patient\'s behalf, which allows the inference that she had a guardian.

Wearing an expensive suit borrowed from a friend, the lawyer went to a furniture store and asked to purchase on credit a desk and various other items of furniture. The lawyer told the store owner that he was a very able lawyer with a growing practice and that he expected to do very well in the future. The store owner agreed to sell him the items on credit, and the lawyer promised to make monthly payments of $800. The lawyer has never had an income from his practice of more than $150 a month. The lawyer\'s business did not improve, and he did not make any payments to the furniture store. After three months, the store owner repossessed the items.\r\n\r\nIf the lawyer is charged with obtaining property by false pretenses, his best argument for being NOT guilty would be that', 'The correct answer is B. Obtaining property by false pretenses requires the transfer of title to the property through fraud or false statements. The lawyer, when he obtained the property, did not misrepresent any material fact, and so did not obtain the property through fraud or false statements. The lawyer honestly believed his business would grow and, although his payment schedule was over his income level, he did not perpetrate fraud on the owner. The lawyer\'s best argument for being not guilty is that he did not obtain the property as the result of knowingly fraudulent misrepresentations of fact.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because guilt under the charge of false pretenses does not require that the lawyer never intend to pay for the furniture. If the owner gave over title and possession of property based on material misrepresentations, it does not matter if the lawyer meant to pay for it; he would still be guilty of false pretenses. Answer C is incorrect because the eventual return of the property obtained is not a defense to a charge of false pretenses. In addition, the owner did suffer the loss of the furniture for three months and the loss of the payments for the furniture, so he did, in fact, suffer harm. Answer D is incorrect because the mere fact that the store owner could have arranged for a different payment plan or for the total payment to be made up front is not a defense to the charge of false pretenses.

Lend my son the $4,000, and I\'ll repay it if he doesn\'t.\" The uncle then lent $4,000 to the nephew, and the nephew orally agreed to repay that amount in six weeks. The next day, the nephew\'s mother wrote to him and concluded her letter with the words, \"Son, I was happy to do you a favor by promising your uncle I would repay your six-week $4,000 loan if you don\'t. /s/ Mother.\" Neither the nephew nor his mother repaid the loan when it came due, and the uncle sued the mother for breach of contract. In that action, the mother raised the statute of frauds as her only defense.\r\n\r\nWill the mother\'s statute-of-frauds defense likely be successful?', 'Answer B is correct. The statute of frauds requires that promises to answer for the debt of another be made in writing. But the memorandum sufficient to satisfy the statute needn\'t be written at the time of the making of the promise, nor need it be a writing addressed to the promisee. In this case, the mother\'s letter to her son, the nephew, satisfies the requirement of the statute of frauds. Thus, Answer B is correct, and Answer C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The amount of the loan is irrelevant here. The writing requirement arises under the suretyship provision of the statute of frauds. A person selecting this answer might be thinking of the $500 limit which may trigger a writing requirement in cases involving sales of goods under the UCC. The UCC does not apply here, since this is not a sale of goods. As to the enforceability of the mother\'s promise, the statute of frauds requires a writing in cases of promises to answer for the debt of another. As explained above, the letter written by the mother to her son, the nephew, is sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. The issue in this case is not the enforceability of the nephew\'s promise, but the enforceability of the mother\'s promise. And even if the issue did involve the nephew\'s promise, there is no statute of frauds requirement that a promise to repay a debt be in writing.

Because the son cannot establish the store\'s negligence, the court should grant the store\'s motion. \r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The son sued the store for negligence, not for strict liability. To recover on a negligence claim, the son must establish that the store itself was negligent.

For a condition on land to be considered an attractive nuisance, there must be evidence that the landowner has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, as well as evidence that the injured party did not appreciate the risk involved.

About a month after his former wife remarried, the defendant secretly entered the couple\'s rented apartment during their absence by using a master key. The defendant placed a microphone behind the book stand in the bedroom of the apartment, drilled a hole in the nearby wall and poked the wires from the microphone through the hole into the space in the wall, with the result that the microphone appeared to be connected with wires going into the adjoining apartment. Actually the microphone was not connected to any thing. The defendant anticipated that his former wife would discover the microphone in a few days and would be upset by the thought that someone had been listening to her conversations with her new husband in their bedroom.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, as he was putting a book on the stand, the new husband noticed the wires behind the book stand and discovered the hidden microphone. He then called his wife and showed her the microphone and wires. She fainted and, in falling, struck her head on the book stand and suffered a mild concussion. The next day the new husband telephoned the defendant and accused him of planting the microphone. The defendant laughingly admitted it. Because of his concern about his wife and his anger at the defendant, the new husband is emotionally upset and unable to go to work.\r\n\r\nIf the defendant\'s former wife asserts a claim against the defendant based on infliction of mental distress, the fact that her current husband was the person who showed her the microphone will', 'C is the correct answer. The elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) defendant\'s intentional (with purpose or knowledge to a substantial certainty) or reckless (2) extreme and outrageous conduct (3) that causes the plaintiff severe emotional distress. The breaking and entering, along with the placement of fake recording equipment in the bedroom, was extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant. Further, the defendant intended to cause the wife severe emotional distress by leading her to believe that someone was listening to her in her bedroom. Even though the new husband, not the wife, found the microphone, the defendant\'s goal of causing the wife distress was achieved. Therefore, the defendant\'s action are the proximate cause of the damages and he will be liable.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The \"careless\" act of the new husband does not affect the liability of the defendant because it does not sever causation between the defendant\'s extreme and outrageous conduct and the damages suffered.\r\n\r\nB is also incorrect. Although the new husband showed the wife the microphone, the defendant\'s conduct was still the proximate cause of the wife\'s distress.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect as a misstatement of the law.

The decedent\'s estate introduced undisputed evidence that, before he swerved across the centerline, the decedent had suffered a fatal heart attack, which he had no reason to foresee, and that, just prior to the heart attack, the decedent had been driving at a reasonable speed and in a reasonable manner. A statute makes it a traffic offense to cross the median of a highway.\r\n\r\nIn this case, which party is likely to prevail?', 'Answer A is correct. The plaintiff\'s evidence that the decedent violated the statute and crossed over the centerline establishes a prima facie case of negligence. However, the prima facie case of negligence may be rebutted by showing that compliance with the statute was beyond the defendant\'s control. Here, the decedent\'s estate successfully rebutted the plaintiff\'s evidence by providing an undisputed explanation of how the accident happened that is inconsistent with a finding of negligence (the decedent\'s unforeseeable heart attack made her unable to comply with the statute or, indeed, with any standard of care).\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the decedent\'s estate will prevail, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion.

In general, an independent contractor is liable for his own torts. However, an exception exists where the contractor is carrying out an inherently dangerous activity or where there is a public policy consideration that makes the duty nondelegable. The facts indicate that the duty to make the sidewalk safe for pedestrians was a nondelegable duty. Therefore, Answer B is the best choice.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is inapplicable on the facts, which clearly state that the repairman was negligent. Res ipsa loquitur is only used where proof of negligence must be inferred.\r\n\r\nAnswer C reaches the wrong conclusion. The homeowner will still be held liable for the actions of an independent contractor because he had a nondelegable duty. The word \"servant\" is a term of art and refers to a hired individual with duties defined and under the control of the one who did the hiring.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is not the best answer.

(1437, 1, 21, 'Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, with certain exceptions not relevant here, the federal government is liable only for negligence. A federally owned and operated nuclear reactor emitted substantial quantities of radioactive matter that settled on a nearby dairy farm, killing the dairy herd and contaminating the soil. At the trial of an action brought against the federal government by the farm\'s owner, the trier of fact found the following: (1) the nuclear plant had a sound design, but a valve made by an engineering company had malfunctioned and allowed the radioactive matter to escape; (2) the engineering company was universally regarded as a quality manufacturer of components for nuclear plants; and (3) there was no way the federal government could have anticipated or prevented the emission of the radioactive matter. \r\n\r\nIf there is no other applicable statute, for whom should the trial judge enter judgment?', 'Answer C is correct. There has been no finding of negligence on the part of the government. The trier of fact found that the government had selected a reliable manufacturer for the component part and could not have anticipated or prevented the malfunction. The court should therefore enter judgment for the defendant, on the ground that a case under the Federal Tort Claims Act has not been proved.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Res ipsa loquitur applies only to situations in which a lay jury could say that the accident would not ordinarily occur in the absence of the defendant\'s negligence. This is not such a situation because it involves complex machinery beyond the ordinary experience of a lay jury. Also, another potential defendant is involved, and the findings of the jury are inconsistent with a conclusion that this is the sort of accident that would not ordinarily occur in the absence of the government\'s negligence.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This is the principle of Rylands v. Fletcher, a case based on strict liability rather than on negligence, and the Federal Tort Claims Act only permits actions based on negligence. See Rylands v. Fletcher, [1868] All E.R. 1.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. The actions of more than one defendant may be considered the proximate cause of the harm to the plaintiff. Moreover, while proximate cause is necessary to establish liability in negligence, it is not sufficient.

Thereafter, a rescuer was severely injured when he tried to reach and give assistance to the climber on the ledge to which the climber had fallen. The rescuer\'s injury was not caused by any fault on his own part.\r\n\r\nIf the rescuer brings an action against the retailer to recover damages for his injuries, will the rescuer prevail?', 'D is correct and can be reached by the process of elimination. This is a products liability question. While the call of the question does not specify the basis for the claim, all four choices deal with aspects of products liability in negligence. The facts indicate that the retailer dealt with the defective goods involved. Sellers of products can be liable for injuries caused by the retailer\'s (or wholesaler\'s) failure to exercise due care. This can apply to the retailer, provided they were physically responsible for the climbing equipment\'s dangerous condition or they failed to inspect the equipment when an inspection would have been reasonable and possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe call of the question, however, is a claim by the rescuer of the purchaser of the defective goods. The issue then becomes whether a non-user of the defective equipment can prevail in a negligence claim for products liability against the seller of that product. The rule is that any person who was foreseeably endangered and actually injured by the seller\'s negligence can bring an action. Privity of contract is not required. While all four of the choices come to different results, they include true statements. D is the best answer, however, because it is the only answer that addresses the first issue a court will determine.
