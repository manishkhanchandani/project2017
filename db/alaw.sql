Following negotiations by Tom, Deccra and Al signed a written agreement on March 1 that Al would receive 50 percent of gross record sales over the next three years. Deccra was aware that Tom would receive a portion of this money under his contract with Al. \r\n\r\nBefore Deccra paid anything it discovered Al was only 17. A Deccra executive secretly met with Al and told him the company would not stand by its first agreement, and an alternative agreement was proposed that would benefit both parties. Al agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement under which he got 40 percent of gross record sales, Deccra got 60 percent and Tom was cut completely out. \r\n\r\nThe song went straight to the top of the charts and Deccra\'s sales were $1.6 million in the next year. Of this amount Deccra paid Al $640,000, 40 percent of gross sales. Deccra\'s distribution expenses were $360,000, and it made profits of $600,000. Tom got nothing. \r\n\r\nTom got a lawyer and sued both Al and Deccra. \r\n\r\nAl also went to a lawyer.

Dan’s friend Ed,\r\nwho also assumed the ball was a genuine autographed 1967 Super Bowl game ball,\r\nwanted the ball, so Dan typed a document which read, “Dan hereby assigns all of his\r\nrights to buy Mary’s football to Ed; Ed hereby assumes all of Dan’s obligations under\r\nDan’s contract with Mary to buy her football.” Dan and Ed both signed three copies,\r\neach keeping one copy and sending one copy to Mary.\r\n\r\nAfter some internet research, Ed discovered that while the Bart Starr autograph on the\r\nfootball was genuine, the football was not the type used in the 1967 game; it was\r\ninstead a consumer product manufactured after 2005. The ball is worth about $1,000.\r\nDan and Ed no longer wanted the ball. On December 2, 2016, Mary sued Dan and Ed\r\nfor breach of contract.\r\n\r\n1. Can Mary prevail on her lawsuit? Discuss.\r\n2. If so, what damages, if any, is Mary entitled to recover, and from whom? Discuss.\r\n3. What defenses, if any, may Dan and Ed reasonably assert, and will they be\r\nsuccessful?

Dick disobeyed his mother and recklessly pushed a rotted tree into the river and it swirled away in the water. No one was hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>Half a mile downstream from Tom, Paula was one of five people on the bridge above Big River fishing for trout. Paula was outside the National Forest boundaries. She had ignored a sign that said \"No Fishing From Bridge.\" Fishing from the bridge was prohibited for traffic safety, but she was well off the roadway and there were very few cars this time of year. Paula was sitting carelessly on the edge of the bridge, but it was a nice day, the water was only six feet below her, and she knew how to swim.&nbsp;</p><p>Tom threw another firecracker into the air and it did not explode.

Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is the\r\nfailure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same\r\ncircumstances. To establish a prima facie case Paula must generally prove DUTY, BREACH,\r\nACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSATION and DAMAGES.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">1) DUTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Generally a person owes no duty to others.

But she was not in the CLASS OF PEOPLE the statute was intended to protect\r\nbecause it was to protect people â€œon national landsâ€ and she was â€œoutside the National Forest\r\nboundariesâ€. Further, she did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent\r\nbecause it was to â€œprevent forest fires and injuryâ€ while her injury was getting wet and having her\r\nmoney stolen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Paula would be unable to prove Tom was negligent per se.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">DUTY BASED ON PERIL?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the zone of danger\r\ncaused by the defendant\'s acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendantâ€™s acts create\r\nreasonably foreseeable peril to others.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Andrews held that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone and breaches it, he should be liable for\r\nall injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it\r\nwas not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area.\r\nAnd there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because â€œno one else was\r\naroundâ€ and there was â€œnothing that could burnâ€.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Paula appeared to be outside the zone of danger caused by Tom\'s activities because she was a\r\n\"half mile downstream.\" Paula might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area\r\nof the â€œgravel barâ€ because Tom should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.</span></p>\r\n		\r\n	\r\n	\r\n		<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 73\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to prove that Tom had any duty at all, and almost\r\nimpossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">2) BREACH?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law a BREACH is the failure to exercise DUE CARE.

And once there he threw the firecrackers â€œcarefullyâ€.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Paula could only argue that a reasonably observant person would have seen the â€œlogâ€ floating\r\ndown the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any\r\nmore careful than Tom.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">3) ACTUAL CAUSE of injury to Paula?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law an act ACTUALLY CAUSES injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured but\r\nfor the act.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if Tom had not thrown the\r\nfirecracker.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom was the actual cause of Paula\'s injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">4) PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury to Paula?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable, close\r\nin time and place to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a chain of causation unbroken\r\nby unforeseeable intervening events.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Generally when there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the last, unforeseeable,\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">intentional act will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole\r\nproximate cause, cutting off all liability arising from prior acts.

Further a reasonable person could not foresee\r\nthat a firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if Tom was the proximate cause\r\nof Paula falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because\r\nHarryâ€™s criminal act was an unforeseeable intervening event.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;TimesNewRoman,Italic&quot;; font-size: 12pt;\">Therefore, Paula probably could not prove Tom was the proximate cause of her fall into the river,\r\nand she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</span></p><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 74\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">5) DAMAGES?\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and\r\nsuffering).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula had SPECIAL damages because she lost \"two dollars\" and she had GENERAL\r\ndamages because she was \"hurt and upset.\" But she got out of the river â€œlaughinglyâ€ and was not\r\nâ€œhurt and upsetâ€ until after she discovered the purse was stolen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore Paula suffered actual damages, but Tom was not the cause of those damages.\r\n6) CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was\r\nresponsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY\r\napproach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiffâ€™s recovery based on\r\nthe degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own\r\ninjuries is completely barred from recovery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">NEGLIGENCE PER SE is defined above. Tom might argue Paula was NEGLIGENT PER SE\r\nbecause she was fishing on the bridge where that is prohibited by statute. But Paula did not suffer\r\nthe TYPE OF INJURY the statute was to prevent/ The purpose of the statute was â€œtraffic safetyâ€\r\nand she was not injured in a traffic accident.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore any â€œnegligence per seâ€ argument by Tom would fail.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Tomâ€™s better argument is that Paula was contributorily (comparatively) negligent because she sat\r\nâ€œcarelesslyâ€ and that placed her in PERIL of falling.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom could easily prove Paula was â€œcarelessâ€ and partly responsible for her own\r\ninjury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">7) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?<br>\r\nUnder tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete defense when plaintiffs 1) put\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">themselves at risk, 2) with a full awareness of the risks, and 3) a conscious acceptance of the risks.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula put herself at risk because she â€œsat carelesslyâ€. She had a full awareness of the risks\r\nthat she could fall. And she appears to have consciously accepted those risks because the river\r\nwas only a few â€œfeetâ€ below her, â€œshe could swimâ€ and it was a â€œnice dayâ€.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore Tom may be able to prove assumption of the risks.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n		\r\n	\r\n	\r\n		<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 75\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">PAULA V.

There are four basic theories on\r\nwhich a product liability action may be brought: Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied\r\nWarranty, Negligence and Strict Liability.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">1) UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses serious and likely dangers, that 2) could be\r\nreduced or eliminated easily, 3) without damaging product utility, or else 4) the product utility\r\ndoes not justify the dangers posed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here the product presented serious and likely dangers because it could burst into flame under\r\nnormal use, and those dangers could have been eliminated or reduced easily by putting a warning\r\non the saw.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore this was an unreasonably dangerous product at the time of sale.\r\n2) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law there is a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY if a product is sold with 1) express\r\nrepresentations that the buyer 2) relies on and 3) the representations are incorrect and 4) it\r\ncauses the purchaser injury. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of\r\ncontract or their family.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Sam made express representations to Tom because he said the saw \"would cut 36\" trees\"\r\nand Tom relied because he \"bought\" the saw. This was incorrect because the saw would only cut\r\n\"18\" trees\", and this caused injury because Tom was \"burned\" when the saw caught on fire. And\r\nTom had privity of contract because he was a \"purchaser.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom can recover under a breach of warranty theory\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">3) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law there is a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY if a product is unsafe for ordinary\r\nuse or for the buyerâ€™s known intended use, the buyer relies on the expertise of the seller, and the\r\nbuyer is injured as a result. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of\r\ncontract or their family.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Tom would argue he bought the saw for ordinary use, relied on Samâ€™s expertise, and was\r\ninjured as a result. Sam might argue that he did not know what Tomâ€™s intended use was, and there\r\nwas no evidence Tom relied on his expertise.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore Tom can pursue recovery on a breach of implied warranty theory.</span></p>\r\n		\r\n	\r\n	\r\n		<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 77\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">4) NEGLIGENCE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Negligence is a failure to use the care a reasonable person would in the same circumstance.

Under tort law a person has a duty to not put an unreasonably dangerous product into the\r\nstream of commerce. Further, a person who makes express representations about a product\r\nassumes a duty of due care to make sure they are accurate and will not create peril.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Sam owed Tom a DUTY because he was the seller of a product that posed foreseeable harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">BREACH? Sam BREACHED his duty because he \"never read the owner\'s manual\" and\r\nmisrepresented the saw.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">CAUSATION? That was the ACTUAL CAUSE of his injury because he would not have been hurt if\r\nhe did not buy the saw.

Tom had INJURY because he was \"burned.\"\r\nTherefore, Tom could recover on a negligence theory.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">5) STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law a commercial seller of a product is strictly liable for personal injury or property\r\ndamage if the product is unreasonably dangerous at the time it leaves the seller. The seller is\r\nliable to any person who is injured as a result.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Sam was a commercial seller because he had a store, the \"Bargain Center\", selling the\r\nproduct. And the product was unreasonably dangerous because it \"burst into flames\" in normal\r\nuse and had \"no warnings on the saw.\" This caused Tom injury because he was \"burned.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom can recover under strict product liability.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">DICK V.

Sam counterclaimed against Windco for damages resulting from the delayed installation and unmerchantable quality of the windows.</p><p>How should the court rule on Windcoâ€™s and Samâ€™s actions? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>Answer A to Question 1</p><p>1. Windco v. Sam â€“ Full Price</p><p>Windco is suing on the contract (K) and must first show that all enforceable K was formed, i.e., mutual assent, consideration &amp; no defenses to K formation.</p><p>A. Mutual assent. 1. Offer.</p><p>a. Advertisement. An advertisement is generally not an offer absent an identified group of offerees to which the ad is communicated, quantity &amp; subject matter. Here, the ad is likely not the offer.</p><p>2. Samâ€™s writing. An offer is a manifestation of present interest to be bound to sufficiently definite essential terms. Samâ€™s writing contained quantity (30), subject matter (window frames), price ($100 each) and his identity. His note to have installation within 15 days manifested his intent to be bound. This was an offer.</p><p>2. Acceptance.</p><p>a. Governing law. Acceptance and terms included turn on governing law. Here 85%, or the main purpose of the K, involved the sale of goods. Goods are moveable personal property; here, window frames. Sale of goods are governed by UCC.</p><p>b. Acknowledgment of Order. An acceptance is a manifestation by the offeror of present intent to be bound to the terms of the offer. Here, Windco sent an acknowledgment of order. Typically, an acknowledgment of receipt of order is not sufficient manifestation to be bound, so this was not necessarily an acceptance. However, UCC permits acceptance by any reasonable means.</p><p>c. Installing. Therefore, the fact that Windco performed and installed the frames will be Windcoâ€™s acceptance, because acceptance can be made by conduct.</p><p>3. Terms.</p><p>a. Merchants. A merchant is one who deals in the course of business with goods of the kind or holds himself out as having special skills in the area. Here, Windco was in the business of</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-2-</p><p><br></p><p>window frames, i.e., a merchant, and Sam was a commercial builder. Sam was a merchant, because he regularly dealt with and had skills in the area of windows. UCCâ€™s merchant-to- merchant rules will apply.</p><p>b. New terms between merchants. Between merchants, new and additional terms are included in the agreement unless: the offer was expressly conditional upon the offerorâ€™s terms, or acceptance was limited to the terms of the acceptance or the offeree objects to the new terms within 10 days.</p><p>(i) Samâ€™s written note - Time for performance.</p><p>Here, Sam will argu e that his â€œmust have guarantee - - - within 15 days...â€ was a term on which his offer was expressly conditioned, and that therefore Windcoâ€™s change to â€œwithin 60 daysâ€ is not included. However, Windco will argue that Samâ€™s wording did not say: â€œexpressly conditional uponâ€ or â€œoffer limited to . . .â€ &amp; that Samâ€™s words were only a desire, not an express condition. Windco will likely prevail &amp; the term is 60 days for installation.</p><p>(ii) Shipping charge &amp; parol evidence.</p><p>Windco will argue that its additional term â€œ$200 shipping chargeâ€ was included, because Sam didnâ€™t object within 10 days. In support, Windco will offer parol evidence of the custom in the industry that shipping is borne by the buyer (here: Sam).</p><p>Sam will say that oral evidence of prior or contemporaneous terms are not admissible if the writing was fully integrated. Sam will also argue that the additional $200 is material &amp; onerous &amp; changed the bargain &amp; that therefore the $200 is not included.</p><p>Windco will however be able to introduce oral evidence</p><p>to explain &amp; clarify what the shipping term was intended to be and what is customary in the trade, as such explanatory evidence is not barred by the parol evidence rule. Also, $200 on top of $3,000 total is not a material additional charge, so Windco will likely prevail &amp; the $200 term is included.</p><p>B. Consideration is the bargained-for exchange of acts or promises incurring a benefit as well as new legal detriment to both parties. Here, Sam obtained goods (benefit) in exchange for having to pay Windco (new detriment). Vice versa for Windco.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-3-</p><p><br></p><p>1. Promissory estoppel. If for any reason an enforceable K is not found, promissory estoppel is a substitute where one party has reasonably relied to his detriment on the otherâ€™s promise. Here, Windco went ahead with the installation &amp; supplied the frames. Doing so, it detrimentally relied on Samâ€™s promise.</p><p>Consideration or its substitute existed. C. Defenses to Formation</p><p>1. Statute of Frauds (SOF). SOF requires Ks for goods valued at $500 or more to be in a sufficient writing. Here, the K was for a total of $3,000 and had to be in writing. Since Sam is the one to be charged the $200 in dispute, his signature was required by SOF, but the â€œAck of Orderâ€ was on Windco letterhead.</p><p>a. Merchantâ€™s confirming memo. Where one merchant sends the other a memo confirming an agreement that the other has reason to know of and understand, the memo suffices as a writing under SOF even if not signed by the one to be charged. Here, since the Ack of Order contained subject matter (windows), identity of the parties, price &amp; Windcoâ€™s signature (or on Windcoâ€™s letterhead), SOF is satisfied.</p><p>b. Divisible K. It can also be argued that the contract was a sequence of contracts, each for $100, and that each such K therefore was not within SOF. The $200 would then be for installation services (governed by common law; not UCC) which do not fall within the SOF goods provision. Since the services were to be provided within one year (here: within 60 days), that SOF provision also doesnâ€™t require a writing signed by Sam.</p><p>An enforceable K was formed with terms $200 shipping &amp; installation within 60 days.</p><p>D. Recovery.</p><p>1. Expectation interest. Windco will recover its expectation interest, i.e., the price it expected to obtain under the contract, which was $3,000 + $200 shipping. Even if the court decides the $200 term was not part of the K, Windco will get $3,000.</p><p>2. Consequential &amp; Delay damages. It W can show that it suffered damages as a consequence of not receiving Samâ€™s payment on time, it will be awarded also consequential damages, i.e., those amounts reasonably foreseeable to flow from Samâ€™s breach at K formation time. Here, since Sam is refusing only to pay the $200 (not the $3,000), consequentials shouldnâ€™t apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-4-</p><p><br></p><p>II. Sam v. Windco. A. Recovery</p><p>1. Consequentials. If the court finds that the time to performance was within 15 days, then Sam will recover consequentials (defined supra). Delay damages that both parties knew or should have known would result from Windcoâ€™s failure to install timely would be recoverable.</p><p>B. Breach of implied warranty.</p><p>Each product put into the stream of commerce carries an implied warranty that the goods are suited for their ordinary use. Here, window frames should be suited for use when itâ€™s raining, i.e., not leak[ing].</p><p>1. Parties. Plaintiff must be a purchaser or user. Here, Sam was the purchaser of the windows. Defendant must be one generally in the commercial supply chain. Here, Windco was (see supra under merchants). The parties are proper.</p><p>2. Merchantable. Defined supra. The product was defective due to a manufacturing defect in that the glass didnâ€™t fit properly; thus not fit for ordinary use (not merchantable).</p><p>3. Defenses. Windco will assert that it disclaimed all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Such a disclaimer is effective if conspicuous, as here printed in bold. Sam will however argue his purpose for entering into the K was to obtain windows that were functional and that Windco will be unjustly enriched if allowed to not compensate him so he can obtain other substitute goods (to â€œcoverâ€) &amp; be reimbursed by Windco for his expenses therefor.</p><p>4. Perfect tender rule. Under the UCC, where goods are to be delivered in a single delivery, the buyer (here: Sam) has a right to obtain perfectly conforming goods. Even though Sam didnâ€™t discover the defect (non-conformity) of the goods until later, he can still reject the lot, accept the lot or any portion thereof, upon timely notice to Windco. If Windco still has time under the contract (5 days left from 55 to 60 days) to perform it has a right to cure by replacing the windows.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-5-</p><p><br></p><p>WINDCO v. SAM</p><p>Does the UCC Apply?</p><p>Answer B to Question 1</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼The UCC applies to all contracts for the sale of goods. Goods are moveable, tangible property.</p><p>Here, the subject matter is shown to [be] predominately goods because â€œinstallation comprises 15% of Windcoâ€™s total price.â€</p><p>Therefore, the UCC applies. Merchants?</p><p>A merchant is one who regularly deals in goods of this kind or who, by his occupation, has some special skill or knowledge as to this type of goods.</p><p>Here, â€œWindco manufactures and installs insulated window-frame unitsâ€ and Sam, â€œa commercial dealer,â€ likely has special knowledge of windows.</p><p>Therefore, both parties are merchants.</p><p>Valid Contract</p><p>In order to determine if any rights exist we first must determine if there is a valid, enforceable contract. A contract consists of an offer, acceptance, consideration and lack of formation defenses.</p><p>Offer</p><p>An offer is manifestation of present contractual intent, communicated to an identified offeree, containing definite and certain terms.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s ad will be considered only an invitation to accept offers. When Sam mailed this order form he made an offer to Windco, containing terms (30 window frames @$100/frame). A reasonable person would believe Sam made a commitment to enter a contract because of this information.</p><p>Therefore, there is a valid offer.</p><p>Acceptance and Acceptance With Addition[al] Terms UCC2-207</p><p>An acceptance is an unequivocal assent to the terms of a[n] offer, unlike common law, where the acceptance must be the â€œmirror image.â€ The UCC allows additional terms.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-6-</p><p><br></p><p>At issue here are the terms Sam first added to his offer guaranteeing installation within 15 days. Windcoâ€™s acknowledgment of order altered this term guaranteeing installation â€œwithin 60 days.â€ As between merchants any additional term will become part of the contract unless the contract limits it to its own terms, there is an objection within 10 days, or the term materially alters the contract.</p><p>Here, while Sam wanted installation within 15 days, the question arises if this qualifies as a time is of the essence condition. Because Sam did not object upon receiving Windcoâ€™s acceptance with additional terms, it likely will be held that this is not a material term. And this term will become part of the contract.</p><p>Shipping cost language will not be a material term as â€œshipping costs are customarily borne by the buyer.â€</p><p>Warranty disclaimers are valid if conspicuous and use the term merchantability.</p><p>Therefore, unless a court finds the installation date guaranty to be a material term, all of these terms will become part of the contract.</p><p>Consideration</p><p>Consideration is a legally sufficient, bargained-for exchange.</p><p>Here, there appear to be no consideration issues as Sam is to pay money, Windco is to provide window frames which neither were legally obligated to do.</p><p>Defenses-Statute of Frauds (SOF)</p><p>Under the statute of frauds certain contracts must be evidenced by a writing to be enforceable. Contracts for goods of $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds.</p><p>Such contracts can be taken out of the statute of frauds by performance. Facts here state â€œWindco installed the windo[ws].â€ Therefore, this contract can be taken out of the SOF.</p><p>In any case, because there are documents authenticated by both parties (mail order form by Sam &amp; acknowledgment of order by Windco) that are writings sufficient to bring the contract within the statute of frauds.</p><p>Therefore, the statute of frauds will no[t] prevent this contract from being enforceable.</p><p>Unconscionability</p><p>Unconscionability arises if there can be shown both procedural and substantive unconsc ionabili ty.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s form stated â€œcontract of sale subject to terms herein.â€ Sam may attempt to claim this is substantively unconscionable, however to be procedurally</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-7-</p><p><br></p><p>unconscionable a party must show a lack of bargaining power. Nothing in the facts indicates that Sam could not have purchased window frames elsewhere. Further, to be substantively unconscionable the term must be one-sided. On these facts there is no indication Windco was greatly or significantly in a position to make such a windfall.</p><p>Therefore, unconscionability will fail as a defense. There is a valid enforceable contract.</p><p>Terms and Conditions</p><p>As shown above Windco performed by installing the windows. This condition precedent was fulfilled. It therefore falls upon Sam to meet his obligation or be in breach.</p><p>Breach</p><p>When one does not fulfill their obligation under a contract or excuse a condition they are in breach.</p><p>Here, Samâ€™s refusal to pay the $200 shipping fee is a breach.

Jon had seen and admired Debbieâ€™s â€œon locationâ€ photography work. He called Debbie to arrange for photography as part of his promotional plan for the spa. Jon told her that he planned to trim 50 pounds from his own considerably hefty frame by participating in the program of diet, exercise and strength training offered at the spa. He wanted to have â€œbefore and afterâ€ pictures taken of himself eating at the spa, working out on the spa exercise equipment and hiking along one of the spaâ€™s scenic trails. The photographs were to be displayed in strategic locations throughout the spa and would be included in the spaâ€™s brochure. Debbie stated that the total charge for the photography (which would consist of five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures and five â€œafterâ€ pictures) would be $1,000. The parties agreed that the â€œbeforeâ€ pictures would be taken on the following day.</p><p>When Debbie arrived at the spa, she learned for the first time that it was a health spa for nudists. Debbie was extremely uncomfortable, but the naked Jon persuaded her to stay and take the first set of pictures.</p><p>On the next day, Jon received the five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures and a letter from Debbie requesting immediate payment of $500, and stating that the five â€œafterâ€ pictures would be taken by her assistant upon notification that Jon had lost 50 pounds.</p><p>Jon consults you and asks the following questions:</p><p>1. Does an enforceable contract exist between Debbie and Jon? Discuss.</p><p>2. Assuming that an enforceable contract exists, can Jon require Debbie to take the â€œafterâ€ pictures personally? Discuss.</p><p>3. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>Answer A to Question 3</p><p>ï¿¼This is a contract primarily for services and will be analyzed using common law principles. Debbie is a photographer and contract is for services - taking the photographs (not for the photos themselves) for common law. UCC rules discussed when they apply only. (Uniform Commercial Code).</p><p>I. Don v. Debbie - Enforceable Contract? A. Formation</p><p>1. Mutual Assent</p><p>a. Offer must contain subject matter, definite terms, and intention to be bound. Here, Jon called Debbie and discussed the 10 photos and their purpose, the terms, and expressed intention to be bound. Offer is valid.</p><p>b. Acceptance. Must be a mirror image agreement to the offer and express the intention to be bound. Here, Debbie accepts Jonâ€™s offer, and both agree to the specific terms.</p><p>c. Consideration. Is a bargained fo r exchange of legal detriment. Here, Debbie agrees to take pictures in exchange for Jonâ€™s payment of money. Consideration is adequate.</p><p>II. Defenses</p><p>A. Statute of Frauds - (SOF) valuable and easily misunderstood contracts must be in writing.</p><p>1) UCC $500 Rule - In order for the contract to be enforceable, it must be in writing if the value of the goods is more than $500 (valuable). Here, under UCC, a writing is necessary. But because this contract is primarily a services contract, it would be enforceable without a writing.</p><p>a. One year rule - Both UCC and Non-UCC. If a contract, at time at formation, cannot be performed within one year, a writing is necessaryforthecontracttobeenforceable. Here,(hopefully) Jon can lose 50# in less than one year, and this rule does not apply. The contract is valid without a written contract.</p><p>b. Impossibility/Impracticability</p><p>If there are intervening events that occur which are unforeseeable, the performance is excused (leg. [sic] illegality destruction of subject matter, death/incapacity of the parties).</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-22-</p><p><br></p><p>Here, Debbie became uncomfortable when she found out that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp. She would try to assert that being uncomfortable once was enough; the second time was impossible for her.</p><p>c. Mistake</p><p>When Ã¢Debbie did not know that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp, Ã£Jon did not tell her that it was a nudist camp, and Ã¤neither party knew (at formation) that Debbie was not comfortable in the nudist camp, there was a mutual mistake. The contract is voidable by either party.</p><p>Unilateral mistake - If Jon could argue that Debbie should ha ve known or asked about certain circumstances that precluded her work, he can prevail on this issue.</p><p>If Debbie can show that Jon should have told her that his spa was a nudist camp, Debbie would prevail. The mistake is chargeable to the more unreasonable party.</p><p>d. Detrimental Reliance - Promissory Estoppel</p><p>Partial performance - Jon would argue that there was a partial performance by Debbie and that he relied reasonably and detrimentally that Debbie would finish the job.</p><p>e. Modification</p><p>At common law, modification requires additional consideration. At UCC, only good faith is necessary. Consideration substitutes can be used, e.g. detrimental reliance, supra. Here, Debbie wishes to modify contract from $1,000 for 10 photos to $500 for 5 photos. She can prevail at common law if she can show additional consideration, or, at UCC, good faith. But Jon has no consideration. This modification is not valid.</p><p>III. Can Jon require Debbie to take â€œafterâ€ pictures?</p><p>A. Delegation of Duty - Courts favor assignment and delegation. The delegation must be with the consent of the obligee or must not be to his detriment. Here, if Jon does not want to give consent for delegation of duty to Debbieâ€™s assistant, he must show that there is diminution in value of the services.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-23-</p><p><br></p><p>B. Personal Services - Contracts are not assignable. If Jon can assert that Debbieâ€™s services were so personal that her duties cannot be delegated, he would prevail. Debbie would argue that photography is not like a portrait and that an equally qualified photographer (such as her assistant) could perform just as well. However, courts are reluctant to enforce specific performance on personal service contracts. Damages would likely be in expectation damages.</p><p>IV. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time?</p><p>A. Express v. Constructive Conditions</p><p>All express conditions must be completely performed to avoid breach. Constructive conditions must be substantially performed to avoid breach. Here, the question would be whether there was an express (v. constructive) condition that the total job would need to be completed before payment in order to avoid breach. The courts wonâ€™t likely construe this to mean the entire contract.</p><p>B. Divisible Contract?</p><p>If Debbie can successfully argue that the contract consisted of 2 parts (before and after) she would be entitled to partial payment for partial performance. This is not a divisible contract and Jon would prevail.</p><p>C. Modification valid?</p><p>No, for inadequate consideration, supra.</p><p>D. Quasi - Contract Recovery</p><p>In order to avoid unjust enrichment the court considers recovery in Quasi-Contracts. Traditionally, only the non-breaching party could recover. In modern law, the breaching party could also recover if the breach were not willful and in good faith. Here, Debbie would be able to recover $500 for value of the before photographs, because her breach was in good faith.</p><p>V. Damages under UCC</p><p>1. Sellerâ€™s breach - When seller breaches, the buyer is entitled to market price minus contract price. Alternatively, buyer can â€œcover.â€</p><p>A buyer is entitled to seek replacement from another buyer and sue the seller for the difference.</p><p>ï¿¼-24-</p><p><br></p><p>Answer B to Question 3</p><p>Enforceable Contract Between Debbie and Jon? Since this is not a contract for goods common law will be the authority. 1. Contract?</p><p>A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty and the breach of which the law will provide a remedy [sic]. It consists of mutual assent and [is] supported by consideration.</p><p>2. Was There an Offer by Debbie?</p><p>An offer is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree such that a reasonable person would conclude that a bargain had been formed. Under common law an offer must include: parties, subject matter, price, and time and quantity. Here the parties are implied because she is â€œstatingâ€ this to Jon.</p><p>The quantity is stated as â€œ5 before pic[ture]s and 5 afterâ€ pictures. The price is â€œ$1,000 dollars and the time is the next dayâ€. Therefore there is a valid offer here.</p><p>3. Acceptance?</p><p>An acceptance is an affirmative assent communicated to the offeror in the manner requested, if not requested then in a reasonable manner. An acceptance to a bilateral offer may be by return promise or by performance.</p><p>Here there is an acceptance because â€œthe parties agreedâ€ that the before pictures would be taken the following day. Therefore Jon assented to the onset of Debbieâ€™s performance.</p><p>4. Consideration?</p><p>Is a bargained-for exchange that causes legal detriment. Here there is consideration because Debbie is promising to take photographs (using her professional skills and time) and Jon is promising to pay Debbie $1,000.</p><p>5. Statute of Frauds?</p><p>The statute requires that certain contracts be reduced to writing to be enforceable. One of these is for goods $500 and over. Although this seems like a contract for Debbieâ€™s services as a photographer, she is also producing tangible moveable goods. The goods were not moveable at the time the contract was formed, however, and therefore the statute would not apply. Therefore a contract exists and</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-26-</p><p><br></p><p>it is enforceable.</p><p>Contract?</p><p>Jon v. Debbie</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Assuming a contract exists, supra, what are the rights Jon may assert?</p><p>Was there an enforceable delegation from Debbie to assistant?</p><p>The law favors delegations. A delegation occurs when one party delegates his duties under an existing contract to a third party.</p><p>Here there is a delegation because Debbie says â€œthe after pictures would be taken by the assistant.â€</p><p>Is the delegation binding on the assistant? A delegation is binding on the delegatee only if they knowingly consent; usually consideration is involved. There are no facts stating whether the assistant consented. One could reasonably assume she was being compensated and consideration would exist.</p><p>Debbie would remain liable for performance as the delegator. Are there exceptions to an enforceable delegation? Exceptions -</p><p>1. Prohibited by contract;</p><p>2. Prohibited by statute;</p><p>3. Too personal in nature.</p><p>Here there may be a valid exception because it could be argued that the artistry of a â€œwell known photographerâ€ is too personal in nature to delegate.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be able to delegate her services. Can Jon demand that Debbie take the pictures?</p><p>Where specific performance would require one to personally perform it will not be enforced based on a prohibition on involuntary servitude.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be forced to perform. She may, however, be enjoined from performing elsewhere during that time.</p><p>Her discomfort may be a factor to rebut based on impracticability. Debbie v. Jon</p><p>If Debbie doesnâ€™t perform is she entitled to partial compensation?</p><p>ï¿¼-27-</p><p><br></p><p>If Debbieâ€™s â€œextreme discomfortâ€ can be shown to make performance impracticable she may be entitled to services already rendered.</p><p>Impracticability exists where a reasonably unforeseeable intervening event, the risk of which was not assumed by either party, makes performance extremely difficult; the duties of the parties may be discharged. Here may be reasonably unforeseeable because â€œit was a nudist camp and Debbie didnâ€™t find out about it until that day. There is no indication she assumed this risk. In order to be successful, she would have to [show] that it would be very difficult to perform the contract. Since â€œJon persuaded her to stayâ€ the first time, it may be difficult.</p><p>She may be able to recover quantum meruit for the services already provided.</p><p>She may argue that there was a divisible contract and recover under this theory. â€œJon received the 5 before picturesâ€ and Debbieâ€™s demand for payment. There is nothing in the contract telling us there is a separate delivery for a separate payment.</p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:26', 1),

Modernly, an aggravated assault is an assault committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D shot at Vic (V), intending to wound him. If V was apprehensive of being shot, D will be guilty of assault. Additionally, because D shot at V with a deadly weapon, a gun, D will modernly be guilty of aggravated assault.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated assault. However, the assault will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>AGGRAVATED BATTERY</p><p>Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another. Modernly, a battery is aggravated if it is committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, D intended to wound V by shooting V in the leg. However, the bullet actually killed V by striking him elsewhere. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, D will be guilty of the battery because the intended harm was criminal, and there is great similarity between the intended harm and the harm that actually occurred. Furthermore, because D used a gun to batter V, D will be guilty of aggravated battery.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated battery, though it will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>HOMICIDE OF V</p><p>HOMICIDE is the killing of a human being by another human being. Here, the facts indicate that D killed V by shooting at V with a gun. There is a homicide.</p><p>CAUSATION - ACTUAL CAUSE</p><p>But for D shooting at V, V would not have died.</p><p>CAUSATION - PROXIMATE CAUSE</p><p>It is foreseeable that shooting to someone with intent to injure could result in a death.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼MURDER</p><p>ï¿¼-12-</p><p><br></p><p>Murder is an unlawful homicide committed with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought may be proven under any of four theories.</p><p>1) INTENT TO KILL - Intent requires the conscious desire to cause the criminal result. The facts indicate that D only intended to wound V, not kill V. Thus, D did not have the specific intent to kill.</p><p>2) INTENT TO INFLICT SERIOUS BODILY HARM - Here, the facts indicate that D shot at V with the intent to hitting [sic] V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg is likely to cause serious bodily harm and the facts indicate that D intended to wound V. Under this theory, then, D intended to cause serious bodily harm.</p><p>3) DEPRAVED HEART ACT - A depraved heart act is a wanton and reckless disregard for the value of human life. Here, D shot at V in a public place with an intent to wound V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg present[s] numerous, dangerous risk[s] to his welfare and court[s] normally hold that any act that [is] likely to cause serious harm to others is a depraved heart act if the risk is disregarded.</p><p>4) APPLICATION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE - A killing will be felony if it 1) occurs during the res gestae of a dangerous felony or a felony committed in a dangerous way, 2) is foreseeable, and 3) is independent of the target crime. Here, the State will not bring a charge of felony murder, because the only predicate felonies would merge with the crime. Because of public policy reasons, courts refuse to apply felony murder to felonious assaults and batteries, otherwise, strict liability for first degree murder would result from each killing.</p><p>Having found malice under the theories of 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, the State will proceed as follows.</p><p>FIRST DEGREE MURDER</p><p>First degree murder is an unlawful homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation and specific intent to kill. Premeditation and deliberation may be proven by application of the felony murder rule, or a killing by poison, bomb, torture, or ambush.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D lacked the specific intent to kill and the felony murder rule will not apply. The State will not bring a charge of first degree murder.</p><p>SECOND DEGREE MURDER</p><p>All murder not raised to the first degree shall be second degree murder.</p><p>Here, because the State proved malice under two theories, but did not raise the charge to first degree murder, the State will bring a charge of second degree murder. Because the State established malice under 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, D will be guilty of second degree murder absent a defense.</p><p>D will be guilty of second degree murder.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-13-</p><p><br></p><p>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional homicide committed with malice, but with mitigation. Mitigation may be proven by adequate provocation or mistaken justification.</p><p>Here, D may try to claim that he was provoked into shooting V. However, the first element of adequate provocation requires that a reasonable person be provoked by the conduct. Here, a reasonable person would not have been provoked by Vâ€™s approach, so V may not claim provocation. Additionally, D may claim that his defense of self-defense is imperfect and results in a charge of voluntary manslaughter. As discussed infra, D will raise a defense of self-defense, and this defense will be imperfect. A court may apply this rule of mitigation to lessen the offense to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>The State may bring a charge of voluntary manslaughter. D will be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he succeeds in mitigating his crime by an imperfect self- defense claim.</p><p>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide that results from 1) application of the misdemeanor manslaughter rule, 2) intent to inflict non-serious bodily harm, 3) criminal negligence.</p><p>Here, D will try to mitigate his charge by claiming that the homicide was only involuntary manslaughter. D will claim that he only intended non-serious bodily harm and the killing was accidental. However, court[s] consistently hold that any intent to harm with a deadly weapon infers an intent to inflict serious bodily harm.</p><p>Additionally, D may claim that he was only criminally negligent, not reckless. Dâ€™s claim may work depending on the surrounding situation of the terrain.</p><p>The State may charge D with the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>DEFENSES TO HOMICIDE</p><p>SELF-DEFENSE</p><p>Self-defense [is] the actual and reasonable apprehensions of bodily harm.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he believed V would harm him. However, this belief is not reasonable, because a reasonable person would not have assumed Vâ€™s approach</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-14-</p><p><br></p><p>meant V intended to do harm. Furthermore, D used unreasonable force because V was not threatening any harm.</p><p>Dâ€™s claim of self-defense will fail, but may constitute an imperfect self-defense that mitigates the homicide, as discussed supra.</p><p>INSANITY - Mâ€™NAUGHTEN RULE</p><p>The defendant is entitled to acquittal, if at the time of the crimes and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) did not know the nature or quality of his act, 2) or that his act was wrong.</p><p>Under this rule, D may claim that he believed V was going to attack D and kill D. If D subjectively held this belief, then he would have been permitted to defend himself. Even though this believe was unreasonable, in jurisdictions applying the Mâ€™Naughten rule, D may not have believed his act was wrong.</p><p>D may be able to escape guilt under the Mâ€™Naughten rule.</p><p>INSANITY - MODEL PENAL CODE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if at the time of the crime and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, or 2) did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>Even though D was capable of conforming to the requirements of the law, he may claim that he did not know his act was wrong, because he believed he needed to defend himself. In jurisdictions holding to the MPC insanity position, D would need to prove he did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>D may avoid guilt under the MPC test for insanity.</p><p>IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TEST</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the result of an irresistible impulse that overcame his will.</p><p>Under this test, D would need to prove he was unable to control himself when he shot V. This test would p robably no t provide a defens e becaus e D could h ave controlled himself, he just thought he needed to defend himself.</p><p>D will probably be guilty in jurisdictions applying the irresistible impulse test.</p><p>DURHAM RULE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the product of a mental defect.</p><p>Here, Dâ€™s crime appears to be the product of a mental defect. That is, D believed V would kill D because of a delusion.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-15-</p><p><br></p><p>In the minority of jurisdictions that apply the Durham Rule, D may avoid guilt because the crime was the product of mental defect.</p><p>WELLS-GORSHEN RULE</p><p>Under the Wells-Gorshen rule, insanity defenses that do not give rise to absolute defenses may negate the mens rea requirement of a crime.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he lacked the mens rea to commit murder because he thought V was going to do harm to D. However, under the malice theories, the State proved that D intended to harm V. Even though D thought he was acting in self-defense, he still intended this harm.</p><p>The Wells-Gorshen rule will not apply here.</p><p>DIMINISHED CAPACITY</p><p>Here, D may try to argue that his delusions diminished his capacity to form the intent to commit murder. This rule only applies in a small minority of jurisdictions and usually is applicable only to negate the mens rea of a crime. Here, D is not seeking to negate the mens rea.</p><p>Diminished capacity will not apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-16-</p><p><br></p><p>CHARLES V. DAN</p><p>HOMICIDE CHARGES.</p><p>Answer B to Question 2</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Murder: Murder is the voluntary taking of the life of another with malice. Malice can be shown by perpetratorâ€™s intent to kill, by his being responsible for death during commission of a dangerous felony (â€œfelony murderâ€), by acting in a manner demonstrating a wanton disregard for human life, or by intending to inflict serious injury.</p><p>Here, Dan is on a busy street and is approached by someone he imagines intends to hurt him. Dan is carrying a concealed weapon, a gun, with which he shoots in Vicâ€™s direction intending, he says, â€œonly to wound him,â€ but a ricochet bullet kills Vic.</p><p>-There is clearly a homicide and Dan is clearly the cause. But for Danâ€™s firing, voluntarily, the gun, Vic would not be dead.</p><p>-Intent: First degree murder is a specific intent crime, usually shown by evidence of premeditation and deliberation, or by felony murder. Felony murder is not likely to apply here. Though crimes of carrying [a] concealed weapon and criminal assault might be felonies, the shooting did not occur in furtherance of these crimes. So, premeditation and deliberation are the focus [sic]. A case can be made that Dan premeditated this crime by the fact that he was carrying a concealed gun. Moreover, deliberation can occur in a very short time; even a momentâ€™s deliberation can be enough to sustain the charges. Here Dan thought about his act long enough to consider Vicâ€™s â€œscruffyâ€ appearance to be a threat to him, and to decide to shoot.</p><p>Second Degree Murder</p><p>Intent to inflict serious bodily harm satisfies the malice requirement. Vic shot â€œto wound Vic in the legs.â€ A bullet to the legs is surely serious bodily harm, so Vic can be found to have malice on this basis.</p><p>Likewise, Vicâ€™s shooting a gun on a â€œbusy streetâ€ is likely â€œwanton disregard for human lifeâ€ so that Vicâ€™s malice can be shown to be based upon â€œdepraved heart.â€</p><p>Finally, the killing of a person by â€œdangerous meansâ€ as a lethal weapon, here, a gun, is sufficient to establish intent.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Prosecutor can charge Dan with first degree murder based upon his intent, shown by carrying and firing [a] gun on [a] busy street and his premeditation. Second degree murder included.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Assault and Battery</p><p>ï¿¼-17-</p><p><br></p><p>Criminal assault merges into battery where the threat which constitutes assault occurs simultaneously with the harmful touching required for battery.</p><p>Criminal battery is the harmful or offensive touching of another without consent. The touching may be indirect so long as a physical touching occurs and the object which touches was set in motion by the perpetrator. Here Dan clearly caused the bullet to â€œtouchâ€ Vic in harmful manner.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Vic can be charged with criminal assault and battery. N.B. Legal statutes may result in a gun charge v. Dan. Defenses For Dan</p><p>Justification</p><p>A justification excuses the crime and results in â€œno crime.â€ Here, Dan will argue self- defense as justification. Self-defense excuses a killing if the perpetrator acted reasonably (general intent) and in good faith (specific and general intent crimes) to protect self from serious bodily injury or death and if the actions in defense were proportionate to the threat.</p><p>Here, Dan will argue he only acted to save himself from Vic, whom he believed intended to kill him, and that deadly force was proportionate and justified.</p><p>However, since Vic made no threatening gestures toward Dan and there are facts suggesting Vic was brandishing a weapon, a reasonable person in Danâ€™s position would not have concluded his life was in jeopardy. So Danâ€™s excuse falls in the majority. His â€œgood faithâ€ alone is irrelevant to second degree murder, a general intent crime. In a minority of jurisdictions, if his mistake is found to be in â€œhonestâ€ or in â€œgood faith,â€ the crime may be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Self-defense is not likely available to Dan.</p><p>Excuses:</p><p>Dan will defend saying he did not have the requisite intent for murder.</p><p>He will say he only intended to wound Vic. However, as discussed above, both the specific intent for first degree murder and general intent for second degree are supported by his acts. His intent to do serious bodily harm by wounding Vic with a bullet, the use of a gun, [and] the thinking he did before firing all support Vicâ€™s having requisite intent for murder, arguably first degree.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-18-</p><p><br></p><p>Insanity</p><p>In majority the defense of insanity is established if, at the time of the offense, the perpetrator was suffering from a serious mental defect or disease such that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act or to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law (A.L.I).</p><p>Here, while Dan is described as having a â€œpathological fearâ€ of long -haired persons, we do not know if he has had an established diagnosis of serious mental illness. If he does have such a defect or disease, Dan will have to show that his delusional state was of the kind that anyone believing as he did would have acted in the manner he did or that his disease caused him to lack substantial capacity to understand that he was shooting someone or that it is a crime to do so.</p><p>Involuntary Manslaughter</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another in a state of passion or high emotional arousal caused by a provocation, more than mere words, that would have aroused such emotion in any reasonable person in that position, and that th ere was no time for the person to â€œcool offâ€, and that he did not, in fact, cool off.</p><p>Here Dan will argue that Vicâ€™s coming toward him looking as he did caused Dan to be so afraid that he acted in a state of high emotion.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Danâ€™s arousal is not that which a reasonable person in his situation would experience. Danâ€™s mental illness is not considered in this formulation.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Charges of murder in first degree will lie against Dan, though they may be dropped to second degree murder. Danâ€™s defenses will fail, except possibly the insanity defense, for which we have insufficient information to decide.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:27:41', 1),

For the child to recover against zoo in strict liability she must simply show that the wild animal causing her injury was owned by or under the care of the zoo and that she suffered injury that were [sic] of the type consistent with foreseeable harm by the wild animal. This is because owners/caretakers of wild animals are strictly liable for the reasonable and foreseeable harm caused by the wild animal.</p><p>Here, the zebra was clearly under the care/control of the zoo when it escaped from its cage. As such, zoo would be strictly liable for any reasonable/foreseeable harm the animal causes.</p><p>Zoo will argue that the child assumed the risk when it petted the zebra and offered itastickofcandy. However,giventhefactthatthezebraisgenerallyconsidered to be a wild animal, and that it is foreseeable that it could bite if in close proximity to a person, this would not relieve zooâ€™s liability.</p><p>II. Child vs. Zoo</p><p>Negligence. For child to recover against zoo in negligence, she must show duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages.</p><p>[Note: Zooâ€™s liability would be based on various liability under the theory of respondeat superior as the zooâ€™s employer (Maintenance Man), and the performance of his duty, set into motion the series of events that resulted in childâ€™s injury.]</p><p>Duty. Dutyariseswhenthereisalegallyrecognizedrelationshipbetweenplaintiff and defendant that results in defendant having to act is [sic] some fashion other than arbitrarily towards plaintiff. The duty owed is one of reasonable care towards all foreseeable plaintiffs in the zone of danger created by defendantâ€™s negligence.</p><p>At common law, duty was largely based on oneâ€™s status in relationship to defendant. One could be an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser. Here the child plaintiff was not on defendantâ€™s property at the time of the accident, but rather was in a residential area â€œnearbyâ€ the zoo. As zoo is in the business of housing, caring for, and maintaining wild animals, it should be reasonably foreseeable that an accident could arise that would result in an animal being left loose in the nearby community, and because of the nature of a wild animalâ€™s behavior, harm could have resulted to a person in the nearby community. This is particularly true where children are around.</p><p>BreachofDuty. Breachofdutyariseswhendefendantâ€™sactionsdonotrisetothe standard of care required by the law. Here, Learned Handâ€™s approach would note that the zoo breached its duty if the cost incurred with avoiding the harm causing incident was less than the product of the probability of the harm causing incident</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-30-</p><p><br></p><p>arising and the magnitude of loss should the harm causing event occur.</p><p>Here, a fire caused a large water main to break with the ensuing rush of water washing away a portion of the zebraâ€™s pen fence. When considering a pen fence, (as opposed to a sturdy cage), itâ€™s entirely foreseeable that a sudden deluge of water could wash away a portion of the â€œfence.â€ As such, the zoo should have ensured construction of a caged facility that would be sturdy enough to withstand this type of accident.</p><p>The cost involved with the construction of a pen of this nature would be significantly less than the potential danger that a wild animal could cause to men, women, and children in a nearby area should that animal escape. As such, it could be argued that the zoo breached its duty.</p><p>Causation. For liability to arise, the zoo (or in this case, the zooâ€™s employee) would have to be both actual and primary cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Actual Cause. Actual cause arises when â€œbut forâ€ defendantâ€™s actions, plaintiff would not have been injured. Here, the zooâ€™s maintenance employee threw a pile of cleaning rags saturated with a flammable cleaning fluid into a hot, enclosed room. The mainten ance man should ha ve known that there was the potential for the rags igniting resulting in a fire. When this happened, the fire set into motion a series of events that resulted in the zebra getting free and the child being bitten. As such, â€œbut forâ€ the maintenance manâ€™s action, the childâ€™s injury would not have occurred.</p><p>Proximate Cause. Arises when a result is the natur[al] and probable/reasonable and foreseeable consequences of defendantâ€™s actions. Here, we look to see if the injury is of the type reasonably expected, or was significantly more severe than reasonably expected. Here, there was a fire, that resulted in a water main bursting, that resulted in a fence being washed away, that led to a zebra escaping, that resulted in a child being bitten by the zebra. The zoo could reasonably argue that the type of injury resulting to the child was not of the type that would be the foreseeable natural consequence of a fire that caused a water main to break. As such, they could avoid liability as the maintenance manâ€™s actions would not be the proximate cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Defenses. Atcommonlaw,contributingnegligencewasacompletebartorecovery. Here, the zoo could argue that the child was contributorily negligent when she petted the zebra and fed it candy. If the court argued, child would be barred from recovery.</p><p>Comparative Fault. Today, most jurisdictions have adopted comparative fault. Here, the could [sic] would weight [sic] the percentage of responsibility on each of the parties and assess damages accordingly. If child was less at fault than zoo, she could recover accordingly.</p><p>Assumption of Risk. If it can be shown that the child knew the consequences of her actions and knowingly embraced the danger, this could bar her from recovery. This would be a matter of fact for the court to decide.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-31-</p><p><br></p><p>Child v. Zoo Strict Liability</p><p>Answer B to Question 4</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Owners of trespassing wild animals will be held strictly liable (no fault need be shown) for damages proximately caused by the animals.</p><p>Zebra a Wild Animal?</p><p>A wild animal is one that is not domesticated (does not serve man). A zebra is a wild animal because its only use is to be displayed in a zoo. This zebra is from a zoo and thus is considered wild.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>The damage to the child was both actually (BUT-FOR TEST) and proximately (LEGALLY) caused by the zebra because the zebra bit off the childâ€™s fingers [sic]. But for this biting, the child would not have lost his fingers [sic]. There are no superseding causes.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>The child lost his fingers [sic].</p><p>Defense.</p><p>Because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability, the only question is whether Child assumed the risk.</p><p>ASSUMPTION OF RISK requires plaintiff to understand the nature and extent of the risk and to disregard that risk. Here there is no evidence that Child apprehended a risk when approaching the Zebra. Indeed, Childâ€™s offer of candy was a friendly gesture that showed Child probably was comfortable and had no idea that his fingers were in danger.</p><p>Therefore Child did not assume the risk of injury.</p><p>Domestic Animal?</p><p>Zoo could try to claim that, like a horse, a Zebra is a domestic animal, and as such, Zoo would not be strictly liable unless the zebra had known dangerous tendencies. However, this claim should be dismissed because a zebra only looks like a horse; they [sic] are not, however, domesticated.</p><p>Under the facts Child should be able to recover from Zoo in Strict Liability. Negligence?</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-33-</p><p><br></p><p>Negligence is conduct that falls below the standard of care set by law to protect others from unreasonable risk of harm.</p><p>Here Child may also assert a claim in negligence if he can show that Zoo breached an owed duty to him, actually and proximately causing Childâ€™s damages.</p><p>Vicarious Liability</p><p>Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR Zoo will be liable for torts committed by its employees if they act within the scope of their duties.</p><p>Here the maintenance employee was doing his duties, cleaning up, when he threw the rag into the hot room. Zoo will be liable for any tort arising from this act if it is tortious.</p><p>Duty.</p><p>Zoo owes a duty to act as a reasonable zoo. In addition, as possessor of land, they owe a duty not to harm others outside their land by activities on the land.</p><p>Breach.</p><p>Under Cardozo from the Palsgraf decision a duty is owed to all foreseeable plaintiffs, generally within the zone of the activity. Here it is foreseeable that an escaped Zebra would run into civilians and so Zoo was under a duty to be very careful this wouldnâ€™t happen.</p><p>Here Zoo breached this duty in possibly several ways.</p><p>1. First, Child could argue that Zooâ€™s employee was negligent in not realizing that a rag soaked with a flammable liquid could spontaneously combust in a hot enclosed room. This, however, is a poor argument because most maintenance men do not have that understanding of physics and chemistry.</p><p>2. Second, Child could claim that Zoo did not build a strong enough fence to keep the zebras penned in. This is not so strong either because the force from the broken water main probably exceeded any natural force that could reasonably be foreseen. But if the fence was not strong for normal wear and tear Child could show breach here.</p><p>3. A third argument, much better, is that Zoo has a duty to notice when wild animals escape and has ready plans to round them up or tranquilize them if they do escape. Here it seems Zoo did nothing while the zebra ran away.</p><p>Therefore Zoo has breached its duty to control its animals.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>Zoo might claim that the Childâ€™s offer of candy was superseding cause that breaks</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-34-</p><p><br></p><p>the chain of proximate causation. However, Child would have to be doing something independent and unforeseeable for Zoo to prevail. While carrying candy is not a response to an escaped zebra, it is not unforeseeable that a child should have candy, nor is it unforeseeable that such a child might offer it to the zebra.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>Discussed supra.</p><p>Defenses.</p><p>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is conduct by the plaintiff that fails to conform to the standard of care set by law for the plaintiffâ€™s own protection.</p><p>Here a CHILD STANDARD OF CARE applies. Child will be expected to act as a reasonable child of similar age, experience, and education will act in similar circumstances.</p><p>Here Childâ€™s behavior is typical of a â€œyoung childâ€ and is therefore not negligent. ASSUMPTION OF RISK fails for the similar reason as discussed supra. Therefore Child could also recover for his damages under Negligence theory.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:57', 1),

But between merchants a SALES CONFIRMATION by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Furthermore, the UCC provides exceptions for <b>SPECIAL MADE</b> GOODS, where there is an <b>ADMISSION</b> by the party to be bound that there had been an agreement, or where there has been <b>PARTIAL PERFORMANCE</b> of the contract (i.e. acceptance of some or all goods or payment).<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under UCC 2-209 contract modifications must be written to be legally enforceable if the contract, as modified, is for over $500.

Most express terms and promises are considered to be EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS, <b>except for TIME</b> of performance, buyer <b>SATISFACTION</b>, and <b>promises NOT TO ASSIGN</b> the contract which are generally considered mere â€œcovenantsâ€.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If an acceptance forms a contract, for UCC say, </font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under the UCC a contract is enforceable if the <b>QUANTITY</b> and <b>PARTIES</b> are specified. Other terms will be provided by the GAP FILLER provisions of the UCC. All express terms and promises are treated as material terms under the PERFECT TENDER RULE.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>15.&nbsp;Was TIMELY PERFORMANCE a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law the parties may <b>agree at the time of contract execution</b> that <b>timely performance</b>&nbsp;is a MATERIAL CONDITION. Then the condition is called an EXPRESS CONDITION, and typically the contract says, â€œTime is of the essenceâ€.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">But material conditions may also be or <b>implied</b> when the <b>parties knew at the time of execution </b>that <b>tardy performance would deny the non-performing party the BENEFIT OF THE&nbsp;BARGAIN</b>, the benefit expected when they entered into the agreement.

However, the modification may be viewed by the Court as a WAIVER OF CONDITION that the waiving party has a legal right to retract, but the Court may estop the retraction of the waiver of condition to prevent injustice.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>21.&nbsp;Was the contract UNCONSCIONABLE?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b>&nbsp;Under contract law an unconscionable contract will not be enforceable because there is NO REASONABLE FINDING OF INTENT to enter into such a contract.

A MAJOR BREACH is either an act which deprives the other party of the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN or the violation of an EXPRESS OR IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION by a party, regardless of its effect on the other party. A major breach EXCUSES the non-breaching party from all further performance of contractual duties and ACCELERATES the future contractual duties of the breaching party to the present so the non-breaching party can seek IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES.</p><p><b>For UCC say, </b></p><p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC any shipment of non-conforming goods is a breach of contract.

But after a condition has been waived the waiving party has a legal right to retract the waiver. 39 Nevertheless, a Court of EQUITY may estop the retraction based on considerations of equitable estoppel.

Describe Negligence?</b></p><p>P\'s only cause of action here is <b>Negligence</b>. <b>Definition: </b>Under tort law Negligence is the failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable prudent person would use in the same circumstances. To establish prima facia case P must generally prove <b>Duty</b>, <b>Breach</b>, <b>Actual</b> and <b>Proximate</b> Causation and <b>Damages</b>.</p><p><b>2. Duty?</b></p><p>Generally a person owes no duty to others. But a duty may be based on a <b>Statute</b>, a <b>Contract</b>, a <b>Relationship</b>, the <b>Assumption</b> of a duty, or <b>Peril</b> caused by the defendant.</p><p><b>Negligence Per Se?</b></p><p>If a <b>Statute</b> creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute <b>Negligence Per Se</b> if the purpose of the statute was to protect the <b>Class of People</b> to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent.</p><p>Here D violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused P to suffer injury. But she was not in the <b>Class of People</b> the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people \"on national lands\" and she was \"outside the National Forest boundaries\". Further she did not suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent because it was to \"prevent forest fires and injury\" while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.</p><p>Therefore, P would be unable to prove D was negligent per se.</p><p><b>Duty Based on Peril?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under <b>Palsgraf</b>, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the<b> zone of danger</b> caused by the defendant\'s acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant\'s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.</p><p><b>Definition:</b> Andrews held that if the defendant owes a <b>duty to anyone</b> and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.</p><p>Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because \"no one else was around\" and there was \"nothing that could burn\".</p><p>P appeared to be outside the <b>zone of danger </b>caused by D\'s activities because she was a \"half mile downstream\". P might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the \"gravel bar\" because D should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for P to prove that D had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.</p><p><b>3. Breach?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law a <b>Breach</b> is the failure to exercise <b>Due Care</b>. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances.</p><p>Here D went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone because he went to a \"gravel bar\" in the \"middle of the river\" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers \"carefully\".</p><p>P could only argue that a reasonable observant person would have seen the \"log\" floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than D.</p><p><b>4. Actual Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition:</b> Under tort law an act Actually Causes injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured <b>but for </b>the act.</p><p>Here P would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if D had not thrown the firecracker.</p><p>Therefore, D was the actual cause of P\'s injury.</p><p><b>5. Proximate Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law Proximate cause means that the injury to the plaintiff was <b>foreseeable</b>, <b>close in time and place</b> to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a <b>chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events</b>.</p><p>Generally when there are tow or more actual causes of an injury, <b>the last, unforeseeable intentional act </b>will be an <b>Unforeseeable intervening event </b>that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting of all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are <b>presumed to be unforeseeable</b> absent additional specific facts.</p><p>Here P was rather far away form D in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further, a reasonable person would not foresee that&nbsp; firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if D was the proximate cause of P falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harry\'s criminal act was an <b>unforeseeable intervening event</b>.</p><p>Therefore, P probably could not prove D was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-09-28 01:34:38', 1),

He went to the drug store and bought Anxiety-Fix, an\r\nover-the-counter anti-anxiety medication that he had never used before, and headed\r\nhome. Tom took three Anxiety-Fix pills, even though the instructions on the box stated\r\nthat a person should take no more than two pills every eight hours. Two hours later, still\r\nfeeling anxious, Tom took four more Anxiety-Fix pills, and fell asleep.

He\r\nwanted to wake her up to discuss what he had seen. Two of the firecrackers landed in\r\nthe toolshed, setting it afire. The sound of the firecrackers awakened Heather and,\r\nupon seeing flames, she grabbed a can of lighter fluid, opened some windows on the\r\nside of the house near the shed, and squirted the flammable fluid on the windowsills.\r\nHeather had been having a hard time selling her house and thought that, as long as the\r\nshed was going to burn down, the house could just as well burn with it since her\r\ninsurance would cover the loss.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Meanwhile, Tom used a garden hose to extinguish the fire in the toolshed before it\r\nspread.

The throwing of firecrackers,\r\nwhich are essentially a flammable and explosive device, should be known to a\r\nreasonable person of being capable of starting a fire. Therefore, the throwing of the\r\nfirecrackers themselves is dangerous, especially when thrown on someone\'s lawn,\r\nwhich may be flammable. Further, T was well aware that there were devices that used\r\ngasoline in H\'s shed, because T had frequently used them. Therefore, not only did T\r\nact recklessly, but he knew that there was even more reason to use caution because\r\nthere was flammable liquid, gasoline, contained in the shed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Therefore, T acted maliciously when throwing the fire crackers.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic\">Dwelling House/Structure\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law, the burning was required to be of a dwelling house.

The tools within the shed did burn, but the structure itself only suffered\r\nsmoke damage. Smoke damage does not constitute a burning because it does not\r\nactually char the building and further, this indicates that the open flame of the fire never\r\nactually touched the shed.

Under\r\nthe common law, an offer must sufficiently describe the parties, the subject matter, the\r\nquantity, the price, and the time of delivery. Under the U.C.C., however, price and time\r\nmay be omitted and a court will substitute reasonable terms for those that are missing.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Dealer showed Buyer pictures of the handgun and the facts state that they came\r\nto an agreement on a price of $2,000.

It therefore matters not whether the offer was by Dealer for\r\nBuyer\'s acceptance, or by Buyer for Dealer\'s acceptance -- either way, it was accepted.\r\nSince the parties immediately prior to the acceptance had verbally negotiated an offer, it\r\nwould not appear that the offer was terminated before acceptance. Since the offer did\r\nnot include a specified means of acceptance, the method of acceptance must be\r\nreasonable, and there are no facts that would indicate that a handshake was\r\nunreasonable. Indeed, since both offeror and offeree participated in the handshake,\r\nand offeror made no objection, it would seem that the offeror consented to that method\r\nof acceptance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The offer was accepted by the offeree.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Consideration\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Consideration is bargained-for legal detriment; \"an agreement to do what one needn\'t,\r\nor to refrain from doing what one may.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the facts show that Dealer was going to transfer ownership of the handgun to\r\nBuyer, which she had no obligation to do but for the contract.

These\r\nobligations arose out of a negotiating, or bargaining, process, and constitute legal\r\ndetriment.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">There was mutual consideration.

First, a request to have the item inspected\r\nbefore purchase may not be sufficiently definite and unequivocal of a manifestation that\r\none intends to fail to perform their duties. Dealer will argue that Buyer\'s statement that\r\nhe \"will not pay ... unless\" Dealer did something he was under no obligation to do is\r\nsufficiently clear as to Dealer\'s intent to breach. Buyer will argue that his statement is\r\nmere grumbling and does not rise to the definiteness required to be an anticipatory\r\nrepudiation. Dealer probably has the better of these arguments. However, it seems\r\nDealer elected to demand assurances rather than treat this as an immediate breach by\r\ntelling Buyer that he \"expect[s]\" the Buyer to go through with the deal. Buyer then\r\nprovided assurance that he would perform, </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic\">before </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">he gave any notice of intent to treat\r\nthe anticipatory repudiation as a breach.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">To the extent that Buyer repudiated the contract, he cured that repudiation with his letter\r\nassuring performance, and Dealer will not be able to escape liability under a theory of\r\nanticipatory repudiation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defense - Mistake\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A mutual mistake is when, at the formation of the contract, the parties are mistaken as\r\nto a fact that goes to the essence of the bargain, and the risk of such a mistake was not\r\nplaced on the parties under the express or implied terms. Such a contract is voidable\r\nby either party.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, it seems that neither party knew the value of the handgun at contract formation.\r\nDealer was originally going to sell it for one tenth of what it should have been, while\r\nBuyer almost backed out of the deal. The mistake in the value of the handgun is\r\ntherefore mutual.

Buyer will argue that the risk of an antique being more or less valuable as a\r\nresult of learning more about the history of that antique is inherent in the transaction and\r\nnot a risk that the parties should not bear. Or, being that Dealer is a merchant, Buyer\r\nmay argue that the risk he created for himself by failing to exercise caution by\r\nresearching before selling, as he should have known to do as a merchant of antiques, is\r\nDealer\'s fault and Dealer\'s to bear. Further, Buyer could argue that Dealer\'s mistake\r\nwas not reasonable, as Dealer could have learned of the issue by doing some basic\r\nInternet searching as he later did.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Due to the nature of antiques and the Dealer\'s failure to research before selling, it is\r\nunlikely Dealer will be able to escape liability under a theory of mutual mistake.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Specific Performance\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Specific performance is an equitable remedy reserved for when money damages are\r\ninsufficient to make a plaintiff whole.

No amount of\r\nmoney can purchase a replacement of it, as the item\'s value is not in the metal the\r\nhandgun contains, nor in the cost to turn metal into a handgun, but in the historical\r\nnature of the item, and history cannot be bought.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The court should grant Buyer\'s request for specific performance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Other Remedy\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If the court refuses to exercise its discretion to issue equitable relief, Buyer may seek\r\nexpectation damages.

The facts suggest that the market value may be $20,000 due to the\r\nlisting price by the dealer and the 10x enhancement of value from the $2,000 original\r\nprice.

The facts\r\ntell us that Arthur and Cassie both \"wanted to make some extra money by selling art\r\nfrom the gallery.â€ Thus, it appears that both\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b.

Arthur paid Woody $500\r\nto take the wrapped package from the gallery, but it is not clear whether Woody knew\r\nthat such an act was intended to help Arthur and Cassie commit any crime. Since\r\nArthur and Cassie were art gallery employees, it may not have been immediately\r\napparent to Woody that they were working to commit any crime. Under majority rules, a\r\nConspiracy requires two guilty minds. Only if Woody shared Arthur and Cassie\'s intent\r\nthat a theft crime be committed, not merely acting as an innocent agent, will there be\r\ntwo guilty minds in this case. Under the Minority Model Penal Code (MPC) rules, one\r\ncan be guilty of a Unilateral Conspiracy with only one guilty mind. In this case, Arthur\r\ncould still be guilty under these facts. It appears likely, therefore, that a conspiracy will\r\nnot be found in these circumstances.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 13\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2.

Trespassory Taking and Carrying Away: Arthur took and carried away (asportation)\r\nthe wrapped art when he handed it to Woody. Here, it appears most likely that Arthur, if\r\nhe had any possessory right to art at all, only had mere custody from his employer, the\r\nart gallery, to handle the art. This would make the taking trespassory. It does not\r\nappear that Arthur had any lawful possession of the art, but, if he did, the crime would\r\nbe Embezzlement as noted below.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. Personal Property of Another: The Wrapped Art was clearly the personal property of\r\nthe art gallery and not Arthur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. With the Intent to Permanently Deprive: Arthur had the intent to sell the art later on\r\neBay. Even if the art gallery could get it back later, the high risk that they would not be\r\nable to would still constitute the intent to permanently deprive.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4.

Burglary: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At Common Law, Burglary was the trespassory breaking and entering of\r\nthe dwelling house of another at night with the intent to commit a felony. In Modern\r\njurisdictions, the dwelling house requirement has been expanded to cover all protected\r\nstructures (structures with a roof), the nighttime requirement has been eliminated, and\r\nthe Breaking requirement has been limited in favor of an expansion of the Trespassory\r\nEntry.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1. Trespassory Breaking and Entering: Here, it appears that Arthur waited inside the art\r\ngallery until it closed for the evening. At Common Law, this would not have constituted\r\na trespassory breaking and entering since Arthur appears to have lawfully entered the\r\ngallery when he came to work that day. By remaining inside after closing, however,\r\nArthur may have committed a \"Constructive Breaking\" in many jurisdictions.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Additionally, assuming that Woody is Arthur\'s innocent agent, the acts of Woody can be\r\nimputed to Arthur. Here, Woody climbed through an opening in the roof. Since the roof\r\nwas already open, at Common Law, this could not constitute a breaking. In Modern\r\njurisdictions, the breaking requirement has often been eliminated or severely limited\r\nsuch that a Burglary might still be found here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. Dwelling House of Another: At Common Law, the art gallery could not be considered\r\nthe dwelling house of another. Under Modern Law, this has been expanded to cover all\r\nprotected structures, structures with a roof, so this requirement would be satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. At Night: It appears that this event occurred \"after the gallery had closed for the\r\nevening,\" so most likely the Common Law nighttime requirement (after sundown) would\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 15\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Intent to Commit a Felony: At Common Law, a larceny was a felony, but under\r\nmodern law it is often not. In this situation, however, most modern jurisdictions expand\r\nthe felony requirement to include larceny and other theft crimes, so this requirement\r\ncould still be satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">5. Conclusion: It appears most likely that in a modern jurisdiction, but not in a Common\r\nLaw jurisdiction, a Burglary would be found. Arthur would also vicariously liable for the\r\ncrimes of Cassie in taking the painting directly after Woody did not show up. Depending\r\non the value of the paintings stolen, some jurisdictions would also consider Grand v.\r\nPetty larceny for this crime.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">E. Murder:\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Murder is a homicide committed with Malice.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homicide: A homicide is the killing of another human being.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Causation: Here, it appears that the acts of Arthur may not have directly caused the\r\ndeath of Woody; however, Arthur did set the events in motion that eventually lead to\r\nWoody\'s death and could be liable for his death here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Malice: Malice can be established in any of four ways: 1. Intent to Kill, 2. Intent to Cause\r\nSerious Bodily Injury, 3. Wanton or Willful Conduct., and 4. Felony Murder. Only the\r\nlast two could apply here since there is no evidence of any intent to kill or seriously\r\ninjure on the part of Arthur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. Wanton or Willful Conduct: In order to have Wanton or Willful Conduct, the defendant\r\nmust 1. Create the risk, 2. Know of the Risk, and 3. Consciously disregard the high risk\r\nof serious bodily injury or death resulting from these actions. It is not clearly that Arthur\r\nwas aware of any risk to Woody as a result of his actions in carrying the package across\r\nthe roof to the other building, but it is clear that walking across a roof at night and\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 16\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">crossing between buildings possesses some risk of serious harm. In addition, Arthur\r\ndid not create the gap; however, he could still be said to have created the risk based on\r\nhis agreement with Woody to carry the art. Based on the above, it is also not perfectly\r\nclear whether Arthur could have consciously disregarded any risk he was not aware of;\r\nhowever, if he was aware, he seems to have disregarded it. It appears most likely,\r\ntherefore, that the actions of Arthur rose to the level of Wanton or Willful Conduct.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Felony Murder: The Felony Murder Rule states that one who kills during the\r\ncommission of an inherently dangerous felony is guilty of murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a. Inherently Dangerous Felony: In most jurisdictions and at Common Law, Burglary is\r\nconsidered an inherently dangerous felony. See above for a consideration of whether a\r\nBurglary occurred. No other crime noted could generally satisfy this requirement.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Some jurisdictions also consider the manner in which the crime was committed but even\r\nthere it would be clear that walking across a roof at night and crossing between\r\nbuildings possesses some risk of harm and might still constitute an inherently\r\ndangerous felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b. During the Perpetration: Woody clearly died as he was carrying the art to the other\r\nbuilding, which was during the perpetration of (flight from) the Burglary if the did in fact\r\noccur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Degree: If a Felony Murder was found to have been committed, the Murder would be\r\nFirst-Degree.

Additionally, Cassie will be liable for Larceny/Embezzlement for the\r\ntaking of the paintings in the gallery directly after Woody did not arrive with the\r\npackages. We are also not told how Cassie \"went back into the gallery.\" If such an\r\nentry could constitute a Burglary, especially under Modern Law as noted above, Cassie\r\ncould also be independently liable for Burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">III.

Betsy\'s refusal to hire\r\nWalter strikes to the essence of the agreement and therefore will be considered a\r\nmaterial breach if there is a valid and enforceable contract in existence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Excuses to Performance - Unforeseeable Event\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Betsy may argue that her failure to perform is excusable based on unforeseeable\r\nchange in circumstances.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 29\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Commercial Impracticability\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Commercial impracticability requires that circumstances not contemplated or reasonably\r\nforeseeable at the time of contracting have occurred, causing severe economic\r\nhardship to one party.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">As a businessperson, Betsy will likely be held responsible for reasonably foreseeing that\r\nshe might lose a major customer.

However, the current trend is to allow suits between spouses especially\r\nwhen intentional torts are involved. Thus, whether Wanda can sue Homer would\r\nessentially be a jurisdictional issue and a matter of law which the judge would\r\ndetermine. If the judge rules that no, spouses cannot sue in tort, Homer\'s liability will\r\nterminate and the directed verdict will be granted. However, this is unlikely\r\nconsidering the current trends allowing suits between spouses. Here, we will\r\nassume that spouses are allowed to sue each other in tort of both intentional tort and\r\nnegligence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">II. IS HOMER NEGLIGENT?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the question of negligence would relate to the burning of the house and\r\nwhether Homer\'s actions were sufficiently negligent in causing the\r\nburning. Negligence requires the finding of a duty imposed upon the Plaintiff\r\n(Homer), a breach of that duty, causation of the injury and an actual injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1.

A duty of care between husband and\r\nwife, as immediate family, is higher than the duty imposed regarding an average\r\nunrelated citizen. The duty to protect from harm is greater because of the\r\nrelationship between Homer and Wanda. Because the duty to not harm Wanda is\r\ngreater than the reasonable person standard a duty can be assignable to Homer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. DID HOMER BREACH THAT DUTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A breach of duty requires actions be committed by the Plaintiff (Homer) that\r\nplace others in unreasonable danger or heightened risk. Breach can be established\r\nvia statute (negligence per se) where a violation of civil or criminal statute imposes\r\nautomatic fault (which then, if the violation is a civil statute, constitutes a rebuttable\r\npresumption by the Plaintiff). Here, there is no negligence per se because there is\r\nno mention of a statute being violated. Breach can also be established through clear\r\nexplicit facts and/or the definable overt actions of the Plaintiff (Homer). However,\r\nthe facts here are murky. Thus, a third method of determining breach must be\r\nused--the method of res ipsa loquitor.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Res ipsa loquitor allows an inference of breach when clear facts supporting\r\nbreach do not exist. Res ipsa requires that the defendant be in clear control of the\r\ninstrumentality that caused the injury, that the injury would not have occurred without\r\nsome sort of negligence by the defendant, that no possible superseding acts occur\r\nthat would remove the defendant from the chain of control over the instrumentality,\r\nand that the plaintiff (Wanda) not have participated in their own injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 20\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">RES IPSA LOQUITOR AS VEHICLE FOR FINDING BREACH OF DUTY\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a. DID HOMER HAVE CLEAR CONTROL OVER THE FURNACE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the instrumentality that caused the injury (the destruction of the\r\nproperty, the \"house\") appears to be the \"furnace in their home\" that had \"stopped\r\nworking\". It states that Homer \"insist[ed] on attempting to fix it himself\" instead of\r\n\"call[ing] a licensed repair person\". There is no mention of any other person or thing\r\ninteracting with the furnace between the time Homer \"attempt[ed] to fix it himself\"\r\nand the \"burning\" of the house. This means Homer was ostensibly the last person to\r\ninteract with the furnace and a reasonable person could conclude that Homer had a\r\nclear control over the physical object of the \"furnace\" which ostensibly caused the\r\ninjury, \"burning\". This element is most likely met on its face since the \"furnace\" was\r\nwithin the purview of the \"home\" which would be interpreted to be under Homer\'s\r\ncontrol (dominion).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b. WOULD THE INJURY HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT SOME SORT\r\nOF NEGLIGENCE BY THE DEFENDANT?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">This is a more sticky issue than the clear control issue, supra, which\r\nseems to be a straight physical-control-over-the-object question. This element\r\nfocuses more on the interaction the defendant had on the object in question.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">On first glance, it seems that since Homer \"having no knowledge of how\r\nthe furnace worked\" but yet \"attempting to fix it himself\" would infer that his lack of\r\nexperience likely caused improper repair on the furnace which then, according to the\r\nfirefighter at the scene, seemed to be the cause of the fire that \"appeared to have\r\noriginated in the furnace\". It appears on its face that Homer\'s repair led to the\r\nfire. However, could the furnace have posed a fire risk prior to Homer\'s repair\r\nefforts? Perhaps. Did Homer\'s repair in fact actually place the furnace in a condition\r\nthat would cause a fire risk when his attempt at repair would not? This is\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 21\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">unknown.

But, the fact that a firefighter (although ostensibly an expert in the field of\r\nfighting fires) making the statement that the fire \"appeared\" to have \"originated in the\r\nfurnace\" is not a direct statement of \"the furnace started the fire because it had been\r\nrepaired incorrectly\". This is probably a matter for an expert witness to determine at\r\ntrial. If Homer\'s actions did not cause the fire because the furnace was already\r\ndamaged and at a fire risk and Homer\'s \"repairs\" did not place that furnace in a\r\nhigher state of unreasonable unsafety then the injury of \"the burning of the house\"\r\nmay not be attributable to Homer\'s act of trying to fix the furnace and negate this\r\nelement of res ipsa loquitor resulting in no negligence. However, if this element is\r\nmet the other elements of negligence must also be met to find liability on the part of\r\nHomer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">c.

Intervening acts are those that occur that are foreseeable\r\nconsequences of defendant\'s acts and do not relieve defendant of\r\nliability. Superseding acts are those that are outside the realm of foreseeability and\r\nwould be those so out of the ordinary that they would relieve the defendant of\r\nliability. Intentional torts and criminal acts are considered superseding.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 22\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, we don\'t know what acts may or may have occurred between the\r\n\"attempt[ed]...fix\" by Homer and the \"home...destroyed by fire\" that may or may not\r\nhave \"originated in the furnace\".

Further analysis\r\noutside the fact pattern will be needed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">It is to be noted that the acts of the fire department in attempting to stop\r\nthe fire may have contributed to the \"destruction\" of the home. However, acts done\r\nduring attempts to rescue are foreseeable results of a \"fire\" by those public servants\r\ntasked with protecting the public, \"firefighters\". Even if actions by the fire\r\ndepartment are found to be negligent that will not release Homer from any potential\r\nliability since intervening acts of negligence are always considered foreseeable.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">d.

However, she did want to call a\r\n\"licensed repair person\" but was persuaded to let Homer fix the furnace instead\r\ndespite the fact that she (likely) knew Homer had \"no knowledge of how the furnace\r\nworked\". Was this enough to place some responsibility of \"destruction\" of the\r\n\"home\" by \"fire\" on Wanda? Perhaps. Again, additional facts will be needed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Assuming the elements of res ipsa loquitor are met, there will be a finding of\r\nbreach on the part of Homer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3.

WAS THERE AN INJURY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">An injury here would be the destruction of the \"house\" by \"fire\" which\r\nwould constitute property damage and thus qualify as \"injury\" for negligence. Pure\r\neconomic damages are not recoverable but personal injury and property damages\r\ndo qualify as \"injury\" for the purposes of negligence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">DEFENSES TO BREACH\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homer may have several defenses to breach that would negate his liability\r\nand thus allow a directed verdict. The only two potential defenses are comparative\r\nnegligence and assumption of risk. Comparative negligence jurisdictions allow a\r\ncomplete bar to plaintiff recovery if that plaintiff contributed in any manner to their\r\nown injury. As above, assignment of responsibility to Wanda will be necessary to\r\ntrigger comparative negligence and bar her from recovery. A bar to recovery would\r\nallow a directed verdict for Homer regarding the negligence claim. Contributory\r\nnegligence, while a defense more often available in a majority of jurisdictions,\r\nassigns risk to plaintiffs based on their percentage of fault and reduces their\r\nrecovery accordingly. Here, only a finding of fault in excess of 50% on Wanda\'s\r\nbehalf (in Pure Comparative Negligence jurisdictions) or 50% or higher (Modified\r\nComparative Negligence jurisdictions) would bar her from complete\r\nrecovery. Finding Wanda at fault in excess of 50% or 50% or higher is unlikely and\r\nthus comparative negligence in both its forms would only serve to reduce damages\r\nwhich would then prohibit Homer from receiving his directed verdict. Assumption of\r\nthe risk is a defense that states a plaintiff is barred from recovery if they knew of the\r\nrisk and voluntarily assumed it. Here, there is no clear assumption of the risk of\r\n\"destruction of the home by fire\" by Wanda and thus she did not voluntarily assume\r\nit. This is not a defense.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 24\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">III. DID HOMER COMMIT A BATTERY AGAINST WANDA?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Battery is the intentional volitional act of the defendant against the plaintiff\r\ncausing an offensive or harmful touching of the plaintiff\'s body or person (a\r\nconnected object suffices).

There is\r\na battery because Homer intended to touch her and caused a harmful and offensive\r\ntouching.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">DEFENSES TO BATTERY\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homer poses a defense to battery that his intent was \"to calm Wanda down\" and\r\nnot \"cause her alarm\".

There is no defense to battery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">CONCLUSION: There is likely standing for the parties to sue; negligence on the\r\npart of Homer has not been clearly established with the facts at hand; Homer did\r\ncommit a battery.

(Flowers) built a large greenhouse facility in a rural\r\narea twenty miles outside of the city of Urbania at a cost of $20 million. Flowers\r\nemploys 20 workers. Because many of the plants grown in the greenhouse require\r\nmore light than is naturally available, Flowers installed a system to provide needed light\r\nduring normally dark periods. The light was extremely bright, casting a glow far beyond\r\nFlowersâ€™ property.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Flowers was successful in its business, but became concerned as the suburban area\r\naround Urbania expanded and as houses were built closer and closer to its greenhouse.\r\nFlowers decided to put up signs all around its property warning prospective residents of\r\nthe light created by the business.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry saw Flowersâ€™ signs when he was thinking about buying one of the nearby\r\nresidences, but figured that the light could not be that bad. He subsequently purchased\r\nand moved into an expensive new home, much like all the others in the area, on the\r\nstreet directly facing Flowersâ€™ greenhouse. After having lived there three months, Harry\r\ndecided that he could not tolerate the light coming in his windows 24 hours a day. He\r\nhas asked Flowers to turn off the lights, and Flowers has refused, arguing that its facility\r\nis completely up to industry standards, that there is no way to continue the business\r\nwithout the light, and that Harry knew about the issue when he bought the house.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\r\n						<li style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">\r\n							<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">What tort claims can Harry reasonably bring against Flowers?

There is\r\nextremely bright light streaming into his home \"24 hours a day\" and he asserts that he\r\ncan no longer tolerate it after enduring it for three months. He will claim that it is\r\nunreasonable because the neighborhood has become fairly residential and as a\r\nresidential neighborhood it is not reasonable to have light shining at hours that are\r\nnormally dark and that any reasonable person would be bothered by the intrusion.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry will argue that the extremely bright light interferes with the use and enjoyment of\r\nhis property.

Flowers did everything in their power to maintain distance as they built\r\ntheir facility twenty miles outside of Urbania. The nuisance is not unreasonable, that the\r\nplaintiff came to the nuisance, and that there are measures that he can take to limit his\r\ndamages such as heavy curtains or shutters. Flowers is a successful business at a cost\r\nof $20 million dollars and is a benefit to the community.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Nuisance claims are judged on the benefit and utility to society versus the detriment that\r\nthe plaintiff suffers.

They likely employ many people and provide a valuable service to the\r\ncommunity at large. Harry also knew via the signs that Flowers posted around the\r\nproperty that the light was part of the community standard and it is likely that the price\r\nthat he paid for the home, although \"expensive\" was reflected in that.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Flowers will also argue that Harry \"came to the nuisance\" and was fully aware of the\r\nconsequences of moving across the street. Coming to the nuisance is not a defense\r\nand is merely used by the court in weighing the damages. They will state that he\r\nconsented to the light when he moved and was fully aware and assented to the\r\nintrusion.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry has a valid claim of nuisance against Flowers although it is likely that he will not\r\nprevail in obtaining injunctive relief.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Public Nuisance\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A nuisance that is a public detriment and usually violates an ordinance and as such\r\naffects the public at large.

Harry will argue that he has\r\nsuffered harm different in kind from his neighbors because he is directly across the\r\nstreet from the nuisance, however he has other neighbors who are across the street\r\nand who suffer from the same issues. Harry will be unable to prove that he suffered\r\nharm that was different in kind from the other people in his neighborhood because the\r\nlight shines all over.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry does not have a claim for public nuisance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 7\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Trespass\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Trespass is the intentional interference with the property of another without consent.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry will claim that there is unnatural light streaming onto his property at all hours and\r\nthat is a trespass. Flowers intentionally lights the area up 24 hours a day in order to\r\ngrow the plants and it interferes with his property by causing him to endure light during\r\nperiods that are normally and naturally dark. He will state that under Martin v. Reynolds\r\nthe harm need not be fully physical in order to constitute a trespass. The case regarded\r\npollutants that were airborne and were coming onto the land, he will argue that light\r\nparticles are similar to the airborne pollutants and that the fact that they are coming onto\r\nhis land and illuminating it at odd hours is a trespass.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Flowers will argue that the pollutant particles were a more physical invasion and that\r\nlight is not causing the same level of harm because it is merely illuminating the area and\r\nnot dusting it with particles.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry does not have a claim for trespass.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Extreme and outrageous conduct that is calculated to cause, and does cause extreme\r\nemotional distress.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry will argue that light streaming into his home at all hours causes him undue\r\ndistress and is emotionally jarring. He will say that it is extreme and outrageous and\r\nthat Flowers is intentionally causing him severe distress because they refuse to turn off\r\nthe light. Flowers uses the light for its plants and does not calculate to cause his\r\ndistress.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry does not have a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 8\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Remedies\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Injunction\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">An injunction is a measure that prevents the defendant from continuing the action that\r\nthe plaintiff seeks relief from.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry will seek injunctive relief for the light shining onto his property.

Nuisance is a type of harm where the D\r\ncauses substantial interference with the P\'s quiet enjoyment of their real property. That\r\nproperty must be in the P\'s possession or immediate right to possession. At the time\r\nthat P filed suit against Flowers he had been living in his home for three months and\r\ntherefore did have possession of the property and a right to sue for nuisance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Substantial interference\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The substantial interference created by Flowers is the use of light that was \"extremely\r\nbright, casting a glow far beyond Flowers\' property\". The quality of substantial is not\r\nmeasured by D\'s conduct, but by how great the impact would be on a reasonable, not\r\nhypersensitive person. Would a reasonable person find this to be highly objectionable?\r\nHarry will argue that not only are the lights extremely bright and disruptive to the\r\nenjoyment of the property when they are on, but he would point out that their light is\r\n\"coming in his windows 24 hours a day\"! There is no escaping the disruption that the\r\nlights cause.

Factors that will be considered are the social utility to\r\nthe community weighed against the harm. Flowers acknowledges the harm that the\r\nlights create, but will point out the social utility of keeping the business operational.\r\nTheir business provides work to 20 workers and is successful. In a rural area, as such,\r\nthat is an income to 20 people/families who live nearby which means employment for an\r\narea that will less likely have high employment opportunities such as a larger city.\r\nThose 20 jobs are important. The business cost $20 million to initiate and is successful.\r\nThe service they provide, growing plants, is valuable to the community; otherwise they\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 11\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">would not have found such success. Furthermore, although there is a harm in the\r\nconstancy of the lights, Flowers will show that the lights are bright at the greenhouse,\r\nbut only put out a glow beyond their property.

This is a type of assumption of the risk analysis. Here, Flowers had\r\nbuilt the greenhouse facility in an area appropriate for the factory. They built \"in a rural\r\narea twenty miles outside of the city\". As the town expanded and grew closer, Flowers\r\nthen put up signs to warn \"prospective residents\" of the light created by the business.\r\nGiven the efforts to build away from a town and the warning that Flowers put forth, then\r\nprospective residents, such as Harry who saw the signs, cannot say that he did not\r\nhave knowledge and awareness of the harm. He was warned and chose to voluntarily\r\nencounter the interference anyway.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">P will argue that although he saw the signs he did not fully understand the scope of the\r\nharm.

In this case, P will request that the courts\r\nhave D shut off the lights that are causing the substantial interference. D will again\r\nargue that the lights are pertinent to their operation. Many of the plants grown require\r\nmore light than is naturally available and will not grow without it, which will impact the\r\nbusiness.

This\r\nstruggle indicates intent on the part of Steve. Finally, it says that Steve \"succeeded\" in\r\nkilling Adam, indicating that he had that desire or goal going into the event. It was his\r\nintent to kill Adam. There is also the fact that Steve is a professional assassin. This\r\nmeans that he kills people for a living. He has done it before. He knows how to do it.\r\nHe is probably good at it. He has probably developed the mental coolness to deliberate\r\nover, plan and carry out these killings.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The intent to inflict serious bodily injury is included in the intent to kill.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Wanton and reckless conduct. This element likewise is included. To assault someone,\r\nstruggle with them and eventually kill them is certainly wanton, a disregard of a known\r\nrisk to human life, but it is also included in the first element of intent to kill.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The felony murder rule does not apply here because Steve was not committing any\r\nother felony other than the murder.

First-degree murder requires the\r\nelements of deliberation, and premeditation, or that the murder was accomplished by\r\ncertain methods such as poison, torture, a trap, explosives, etc. First-degree murder\r\ncan also be established by the felony murder rule.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">In Steve\'s case, again from his acceptance of Will\'s request to kill Adam, and from his\r\nconfirmation that he would kill Adam in spite of the fact that Steve no longer wanted him\r\nto kill Adam, deliberation and premeditation are strongly indicated.

It also further corroborates the conspiracy.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Second-degree murder is all murder which is not first degree.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Mitigation to voluntary manslaughter\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Murder can be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter due to the heat of passion defense,\r\nmistaken justification or excuse, coercion or diminished capacity.

It is true that Adam\r\nresisted and put Steve\'s life at risk. However, because Steve was the initial aggressor\r\nand because his intent was to kill Adam, this defense would not be allowed. Rather it\r\nwas Adam who would have had the defense of self-defense if he had killed Steve in an\r\nattempt to protect himself.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Will\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Solicitation - - solicitation is requesting, counseling or inciting another to commit a crime.\r\nSolicitation is a specific intent crime which is complete upon the act of the request, etc.\r\nWill \"asked\" Steve to kill Adam.

Here Will certainly\r\nhad knowledge of Adam\'s murder because he requested Steve to do it. He also had to\r\neither solicit or assist in the target crime. Here Will solicited. He gave Steve the idea in\r\nthe first place. Lastly, some courts require intent that the target crime be accomplished,\r\nindicated often by a corrupt stake in the venture. In this case, Will initially had the intent\r\nbecause he asked Steve to do it. Also he had a corrupt goal, to put a business\r\ncompetitor out of business. At least at the moment of solicitation, Will had the\r\nknowledge of the target crime and the intent that it would be accomplished.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Merger--solicitation merges with either the attempt, the commission of the target crime\r\nor with conspiracy. In this case, Will will be found to be an accomplice, thus liable for\r\nthe target crime which was successfully accomplished. He will also likely be found\r\nliable for conspiracy (infra). So solicitation in his case merges.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Conspiracy--see definition supra--Will agreed with Steve that Steve would kill Adam. A\r\nmodern court may look for some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Again,\r\nSteve\'s actions to kill Adam supply the necessary overt acts.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Pinkerton\'s Rule -- the general rule of conspiracy liability states that a coconspirator will\r\nbe liable for all the crimes of all the conspirators which are accomplished in furtherance\r\nof the conspiracy or are a foreseeable result of the conspiracy. The murder of Adam\r\nwas the clear and unique goal of the conspiracy, therefore, Will will be found liable for\r\nthe first-degree murder of Adam, unless he has some valid defense.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 27\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defenses:\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Withdrawal\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Will would argue that he withdrew from the conspiracy before the actual target crime\r\nwas attempted and accomplished. In order for a withdrawal to be valid and to excuse a\r\ncoconspirator from the future crimes of the conspiracy, it is necessary that, one, the\r\ncoconspirator notify the other conspirators of their withdrawal. In this case, Will notified\r\nSteve. He said that he had changed his mind and that he no longer wanted Steve to kill\r\nAdam. However, in addition most courts will require that the defendant have thwarted\r\nthe success of the conspiracy in circumstances indicating a complete and voluntary\r\nwithdrawal from the criminal purpose. In other words, Will would have had to either\r\nsomehow stop Steve himself, or notify the legal authorities so that Steve would be\r\nstopped from killing Adam. Absent such thwarting, Will\'s withdrawal is ineffective, and\r\nhe will be liable for the murder of Adam on the basis of accomplice liability and\r\nconspiracy liability.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 28\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 16.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">QUESTION 3\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Jane, a babysitter, took three 6-year-old childrenâ€”Abe, Betty, and Carlâ€”to the\r\nplayground.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Abe ran through flower beds bordering the playground.

At\r\nissue is what was the crime to be committed? Angela suspected that horses were\r\nbeing abused, and wanted to break into Chris\' land to investigate (burglary, if there is an\r\nintent to commit a felony once inside), but it is unclear what they intended to do after\r\nentering the barn. Given that Angela &amp; Bart are animal rights activists, it can be\r\npresumed that if they did see horses being abused, they may have taken immediate\r\naction such as taking the horses (larceny).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If it was their intent to commit a crime once inside the barn, then they would be found\r\nliable for conspiracy as the conspiracy is complete once the agreement is made; the\r\ncrime does not actually have to be committed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">II. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Burglary</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">: At common Law, burglary is a breaking and entering at nighttime, into\r\nthe dwelling house of another, with the intent to commit a felony inside.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Angela and Bart did commit a breaking by opening the door to the barn and an\r\nentering by stepping inside.

One method to determine if a duty is breached is to\r\ncompare the burden to avoid the harm and the utility of the defendant\'s conduct against\r\nthe gravity of harm combined with the likelihood of the harm. Here, Abe\'s burden to\r\navoid any harm was rather low, since all he needed to do was not cut down the tree.\r\nAdditionally, Abe may have been able to simply contact the local municipality and have\r\nthem address his problem with the tree. The utility of Abe\'s conduct is also rather low,\r\nsince his only benefit was the relief from having to rake leaves. The gravity of the harm\r\nsuffered by Cindy was great as she suffered serious injury. The likelihood of Cindy\r\nsuffering such injury was also relatively high, since Abe knew that Bill was in the tree\r\nand was likely to be injured, which would prompt a passerby to assist Bill. Based on this\r\nanalysis, Abe breached his duty of reasonable care to Cindy, since the gravity of harm\r\nand the likelihood of harm greatly outweigh the burden to avoid the harm and the utility\r\nof Abe\'s conduct.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">17\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 19\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Causation-- In order to be liable for negligence, the defendant must be both the actual\r\ncause and proximate cause of the harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Actual cause-- one test used to determine actual cause is the but for test; but for Abe\'s\r\ncutting down the tree, would Cindy have been injured? Clearly the answer is no, so\r\nunder this test Abe is an actual cause of harm. Another test used to determine actual\r\ncause is the substantial factor test; was Abe a substantial factor in Cindy\'s harm? Again\r\nthe answer is clear; Abe was a substantial factor in Cindy\'s harm.

Therefore, this intervening\r\nact would not cut off liability.

Cindy can claim that she acted perfectly reasonable under the\r\ncircumstances, because there was an emergency situation. Under emergency\r\nsituations, the actor is to act reasonably under the circumstances at hand, even if in\r\nhindsight it is shown that they did not take the wisest course of action.

She used her tablet computer to go on Sallyâ€™s\r\nFacebook page. There, she saw a note posted by Judy, another Facebook friend of\r\nSally, stating: â€œThe doll is worth way more than you think. Donâ€™t sell it.â€ Barbara then\r\nleft a note stating, â€œIâ€™ll take the doll for $450.

As he reached the bottom, he screamed as soil caved in around him and he was\r\nburied.

Here, in order for Patricia to bring a reasonable\r\nsuit against Contractor she must be able to show that Foreman was an employee of\r\nContractor and that Foreman was negligent.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">In this case, Foreman worked for Contractor. There are no facts to indicate that\r\nForeman was an independent contractor. Contractor left him in charge of the\r\nconstruction site which included the authority to shut down the work site and make other\r\ndecisions in regards to the work being performed. As such, Foreman would be\r\nconsidered an employee of Contractor. If Patricia can assert that Foreman was\r\nnegligent, as discussed below, she will be able to assert a claim against Contractor for\r\nvicarious liability for the damages suffered by Stephen and recover from Contractor.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">B. Negligence. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Patricia can also assert a direct claim against Contractor for negligence.\r\nWhen one takes an affirmative act and fails to act as a reasonable person and a harm\r\nresults they can be held liable as being negligent. In order to assert her claim she must\r\nshow that there was a duty, that duty was breached, the harm caused was a result of\r\nthe breach, damages were suffered and there are no defenses.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">1. Duty</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">. When one takes an affirmative act they owe a duty of reasonable care to all\r\nforeseeable plaintiffs.

Under the majority\r\nview it is held that a duty of reasonable care is owed to all plaintiffs in the foreseeable\r\nzone of danger. Contractor may argue that Stephen was not in the foreseeable zone of\r\ndanger; however, even though he was at school the excavation was occurring at his\r\nhouse, and as such it is foreseeable that he would be present at some time during the\r\nconstruction as construction of a room addition cannot occur within one day of\r\nbeginning to completion. Therefore, Stephen would have been in the foreseeable zone\r\nof danger and was owed a duty of reasonable care. Under the minority view a duty is\r\nowed to all. Under either view, Contractor by beginning the construction owed a duty of\r\ncare to Stephen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">2. Breach of Duty. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When one owes a duty of care, the breach of such duty must be\r\nshown in order to show that there was negligence. Here, there are two theories under\r\nwhich Patricia can try to establish that Contractor breached his duty.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">a. Negligence per se </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">- When there is a statute in place, that statute can be used to set\r\nthe duty and if that statute is not followed can be used to show that the duty was\r\nbreached. In order to show this Patricia must show that the statute was in place to\r\nprevent the type of harm that was suffered, and that the plaintiff was in the class of\r\npeople the statute was designed to protect.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, that standard was intended to protect workers from cave-ins. Since the statute\r\nwas in place to protect from cave-ins, which is what occurred, it was specifically\r\ninstituted to protect from this type of harm. However, it was specifically put into place to\r\nprotect workers, which is the class of plaintiff it is designed to protect. Since Stephen\r\nwas her son, he is not a worker, he is not in the type of class of people the statute was\r\ndesigned to protect; therefore Patricia would be unable to prove breach through the use\r\nof the statute.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">6\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 7\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">b. Reasonable standard. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When one is shown to have acted unreasonably then they\r\nhave breached their duty. Unreasonableness can be shown when the burden of\r\navoiding the harm causing activity paired with the social utility of that activity is less than\r\nthe likelihood that the harm will occur and the gravity of the harm suffered.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor left his employee, Foreman, in charge of the excavation. However, his\r\nduty was to ensure that his plans were such that did not pose a risk to either his\r\nemployees or the people that may be nearby the construction site. Being a contractor,\r\nhe should be knowledgeable to the statutes within the area and adjust his plans\r\naccordingly. As such, since it would take Contractor very little to be knowledgeable of\r\nthe accepted practices within the industry, as he has been in this industry, he owed a\r\nduty of care and reasonable conduct to ensure that his construction sites were safe,\r\nespecially since he left other employees in charge of the sites. If he can show that\r\nForeman acted outside of his scope and therefore did not comply with his instructions\r\nthen he can show that he did not act unreasonably and there was no breach of duty.\r\nHowever, if it is found that Contractor should have known of the risk and did not instill\r\npractices to prevent harm, such as here, setting up an excavation that is clearly against\r\nstatute, then he acted unreasonably and breached his duty of care.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">c. Causation</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">.

This occurred after Contractor\'s breach of duty, which was the improper\r\nexcavation site. However, the question is whether or not this was a foreseeable event\r\nthat occurred. Normally a person will not be held liable for the tortious acts of a third\r\nperson; however, negligence on the part of another person is foreseeable.

However under the modern majority the theory of\r\ncomparative negligence will be applied and the plaintiff\'s recovery will be reduced by the\r\npercentage of their fault. Depending on the jurisdiction, it will depend on whether they\r\nwill receive recovery no matter the percentage of their fault or if they will be barred if\r\nthey are determined to be more at fault than the defendant.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor will assert that Stephen was negligent when he decided to climb into\r\nan excavated home in a construction area since it is unreasonable to do so.

A 10-year old boy\r\nnormally enjoys digging holes, climbing into them and exploring. As such, if he is judged\r\non the child standard, he will not be determined to have been negligent and Patricia will\r\nbe able to recover no matter the jurisdiction.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">8\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">II.

However, since he was aware by the statute that the excavation site could cave\r\nin which could result in serious harm or death, when he left it unattended, it was\r\npossible for someone he was unaware of to enter the hole, as what happened here\r\nwhen Stephen entered the hole. He could have merely made his phone call by the site,\r\nor left it attended by someone or placed a barrier or warning up to stop people from\r\nentering the whole. This would have required very little effort on his part, and by the use\r\nof a barrier or warning or being present he could have easily prevented Stephen from\r\nentering the hole.

In such an emergency situation,\r\nwhere the plaintiff is unable to give consent but it is such a situation that normally the\r\nreasonable person would give the consent, it is implied that consent was given.

The elements of breaking and entry was satisfied when Ann broke a window in\r\nthe back door and entered the building. The building she entered was a dwelling\r\n(house) and it was not hers, it was possessed by Victor, therefore satisfying the third\r\nand fourth elements. It is stated that this occurred at night, satisfying the fifth element,\r\nand so all that is remaining is that she entered to commit a felony, in this case robbery\r\n(see below). Therefore, she can reasonably be charged with burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Modern statutory changes to burglary often remove the requirement of breaking,\r\nexpand the types of buildings that it applies to, and no longer requires that the offense\r\noccurs at night. However, since this merely expands potential liability, the fact that all\r\nthe common law elements are met means that she would still be liable regardless of\r\nwhether the jurisdiction where this incident occurred had adopted modern changes or\r\nnot. Burglary is a felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(B) Robbery / Attempted Robbery / Aggravated Robbery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Robbery, at common law, required the following elements: (1) obtaining possession; (2)\r\nof personal property; (3) by way of intimidation or force; (4) from another\'s person or\r\npresence; (5) with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. Ann obtained possession\r\nof $500 from Victor\'s home, satisfying the first two elements. While she attempted to\r\nuse intimidation, she eventually succeeded by way of force, satisfying the third element.\r\nVictor was certainly alive at the start of the robbery, and regardless of whether he\r\ntechnically died before or after he died should make little difference because it appears\r\nto all have been in a matter of minutes. Considering that he died from her force and she\r\nimmediately took the $500, the fourth element should be met.

When a killing occurs during the commission of a felony implied malice\r\nwill be found and the defendant can be charged with felony murder. One requirement is\r\nthat the death must be a foreseeable result of the commission of the felony. A death\r\nthat occurs in the course of a robbery will be found to be foreseeable, especially when\r\nthe defendant uses a deadly weapon to accomplish the robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law there were only a small number of enumerated felonies, any of which\r\ncould serve for felony murder. Modern jurisdictions have many more felonies than at\r\ncommon law and only certain felonies will result in first-degree felony murder (others will\r\nresult in second-degree felony murder). Jurisdictions following the Model Penal Code\r\ninclude kidnapping, robbery, burglary, arson, and rape. If the jurisdiction in which this\r\noccurred follows modern changes Ann could reasonably be charged with first-degree\r\nfelony murder. Regardless she can be reasonably charged with murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann might also be charged with some other form of homicide.

Ann struck a bicyclist while\r\nspeeding away from Victor\'s house. It is unclear whether this collision was accidental or\r\nintentional. If it was intentional, then all the elements are met--unlawful physical force\r\nwas applied to the bicyclist resulting in harm while accompanied with the necessary\r\nmens rea of general intent. Even if the contact was accidental, it may be found to have\r\nbeen unlawful because Ann was fleeing from the scene of a felony (assuming one was\r\ncommitted) and had not yet reached a place of temporary safety.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(E) Larceny\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law the elements of larceny are: (1) a taking; (2) and carrying away\r\n(asportation); (3) of property; (4) of another; (5) with intent to permanently deprive them\r\nof it. Larceny could be charged against Ann in the event that Victor\'s death prevents the\r\ncharge of robbery. If robbery cannot be charged, then Ann committed larceny when she\r\ntook the $500 from his house and carried it away with the intent to permanently keep it\r\nfor herself. Even if this property no longer belonged to Victor because he was dead, it\r\ndid belong to someone else (next of kin) and did not, according to the prosecution,\r\nbelong to Ann. Note however, that Ann cannot be convicted of both robbery and\r\nlarceny, as that would be double jeopardy. She can reasonably be charged with both,\r\nbut the jury can only find her guilty of one at most.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(F) Merger\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law, misdemeanors committed in the same act as a felony merged into the\r\nfelony.

However, when a\r\nperson is convicted of felony murder, the underlying felony merges with the felony\r\nmurder. Therefore, if Ann is convicted of felony murder, the underlying felony (burglary,\r\nrobbery) will merge with it and she can only be convicted of the felony murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Additionally, a lesser included offense merges with a greater offense. If Ann were\r\nconvicted of felony murder she could not also be convicted of another form of criminal\r\nhomicide. If she is convicted of aggravated robbery she cannot also be convicted of\r\nrobbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(2) Ann\'s Defenses\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(A) Defense to Burglary\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann\'s best defense to burglary is that she did not intend to commit a felony in the house\r\nof Victor. Burglary is a specific intent crime which means that Ann must have held the\r\nspecific intention to commit a felony in his home when it was combined with her act of\r\nbreaking and entry. Ann will argue that because the $500 rightfully was hers, she was\r\nnot breaking in to commit robbery. Regardless of whether she did or did not commit\r\nrobbery, she did not believe she was committing robbery, and therefore she did not\r\nhave the requisite intent when breaking into the house.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(B) Defense to Robbery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann\'s first defense to robbery is similar to her defense for burglary. She will argue that\r\nbecause the $500 rightfully belonged to her, she had no intention to permanently\r\ndispossess Victor of any of his property. This is difficult though, because what she was\r\nseeking to reclaim, money, is fungible. She had no way of knowing that the $500 she\r\ntook was her $500. Courts will generally disallow a defense for recovery of fungible\r\nitems. However, she still will argue that she lacked the intent to permanently deprive\r\nhim. Because she did not intend to permanently deprive him, she may be able to negate\r\nthe intent element of robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">23\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 24\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(C) Defense to First Degree Felony Murder / Homicide\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Her best defense to felony murder is that she did not commit the underlying felony of\r\nburglary or robbery. With regard to another form of homicide that she could be charged\r\nwith, her best defense is that she was justified in acting in self-defense. While she was\r\nthe initial aggressor, she is able to regain her right to self-defense if the other party\r\nsuddenly escalates the confrontation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If Victor had pulled out his own gun and she had shot him first, she probably would not\r\nbe able to claim self-defense. However, because Victor disarmed her and turned her\r\nown gun at her while stating an intent to kill her, she was justified in using self-defense.\r\nVictor was only allowed to use necessary force in his own self-defense and shooting her\r\nonce she no longer posed a threat went beyond that. By stating that he was going to\r\nshoot her, while having the apparent ability to do so (point the gun), that allowed Ann to\r\nregain her right of self-defense and to attempt to take the gun back in order to preserve\r\nher own life.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(D) Defense to Battery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Her best defense to battery is that she lacked the necessary intent. Battery requires\r\ngeneral intent which is that the actor knew that they were acting in the proscribed way\r\nand was aware of all attendant circumstances. She was aware she was speeding, but\r\nwas probably unaware of the bicyclist until it was too late to avoid her. Speeding could\r\nbe viewed as negligent or reckless. If it is viewed as recklessness, it must represent a\r\ngross deviation of a risk that a similarly situated person would take given the purpose of\r\ntheir conduct. Her purpose--fleeing the scene--would not be an acceptable purpose.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If it is viewed as negligent, it must be criminally negligent which requires a higher\r\ndegree of fault than criminal negligence. Her ignorance of the risk must have been a\r\ngross deviation from what a normal person in her position would realize. Since many\r\npeople speed, it could be argued that this is not a gross deviation, and fails to rise to the\r\nlevel of criminal negligence or criminal recklessness.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">24\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 25\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">State v.

Also, the facts\r\nindicate that the home belonged to Victor; therefore, it was the dwelling of another,\r\nAdditionally, the incident occurred at a time when Ann drove to Victor\'s house in the\r\nnighttime; thus the nighttime requirement is satisfied.

The County would argue that the\r\nnoise was insufficient interference to prevent Ken from enjoying his land because Ken \"didn\'t\r\nthink the noise was so bad\" when he bought the house.

The\r\nCounty might argue it was not responsible because the increase in noise was caused by \"military\r\nuse\" beyond their control. Alternatively, the County would argue that it acted reasonably because\r\nthe flights were in response to the \"Romaria crisis.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Ken would argue he suffered damages because the value of his home was less that it otherwise\r\nwould be.

If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive\r\nrelief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy,\r\nand the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the\r\ninterests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive\r\nrelief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property\r\nvalue caused by the nuisance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here the nuisance is a permanent condition, so the Court would consider injunctive relief.

Therefore, the fact that Windco performed and installed the frames will be Windcoâ€™s acceptance, because acceptance can be made by conduct.</p><p>3. Terms.</p><p>a. Merchants. A merchant is one who deals in the course of business with goods of the kind or holds himself out as having special skills in the area. Here, Windco was in the business of</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-2-</p><p><br></p><p>window frames, i.e., a merchant, and Sam was a commercial builder. Sam was a merchant, because he regularly dealt with and had skills in the area of windows. UCCâ€™s merchant-to- merchant rules will apply.</p><p>b. New terms between merchants. Between merchants, new and additional terms are included in the agreement unless: the offer was expressly conditional upon the offerorâ€™s terms, or acceptance was limited to the terms of the acceptance or the offeree objects to the new terms within 10 days.</p><p>(i) Samâ€™s written note - Time for performance.</p><p>Here, Sam will argu e that his â€œmust have guarantee - - - within 15 days...â€ was a term on which his offer was expressly conditioned, and that therefore Windcoâ€™s change to â€œwithin 60 daysâ€ is not included. However, Windco will argue that Samâ€™s wording did not say: â€œexpressly conditional uponâ€ or â€œoffer limited to . . .â€ &amp; that Samâ€™s words were only a desire, not an express condition. Windco will likely prevail &amp; the term is 60 days for installation.</p><p>(ii) Shipping charge &amp; parol evidence.</p><p>Windco will argue that its additional term â€œ$200 shipping chargeâ€ was included, because Sam didnâ€™t object within 10 days. In support, Windco will offer parol evidence of the custom in the industry that shipping is borne by the buyer (here: Sam).</p><p>Sam will say that oral evidence of prior or contemporaneous terms are not admissible if the writing was fully integrated. Sam will also argue that the additional $200 is material &amp; onerous &amp; changed the bargain &amp; that therefore the $200 is not included.</p><p>Windco will however be able to introduce oral evidence</p><p>to explain &amp; clarify what the shipping term was intended to be and what is customary in the trade, as such explanatory evidence is not barred by the parol evidence rule. Also, $200 on top of $3,000 total is not a material additional charge, so Windco will likely prevail &amp; the $200 term is included.</p><p>B. Consideration is the bargained-for exchange of acts or promises incurring a benefit as well as new legal detriment to both parties. Here, Sam obtained goods (benefit) in exchange for having to pay Windco (new detriment). Vice versa for Windco.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-3-</p><p><br></p><p>1. Promissory estoppel. If for any reason an enforceable K is not found, promissory estoppel is a substitute where one party has reasonably relied to his detriment on the otherâ€™s promise. Here, Windco went ahead with the installation &amp; supplied the frames. Doing so, it detrimentally relied on Samâ€™s promise.</p><p>Consideration or its substitute existed. C. Defenses to Formation</p><p>1. Statute of Frauds (SOF). SOF requires Ks for goods valued at $500 or more to be in a sufficient writing. Here, the K was for a total of $3,000 and had to be in writing. Since Sam is the one to be charged the $200 in dispute, his signature was required by SOF, but the â€œAck of Orderâ€ was on Windco letterhead.</p><p>a. Merchantâ€™s confirming memo. Where one merchant sends the other a memo confirming an agreement that the other has reason to know of and understand, the memo suffices as a writing under SOF even if not signed by the one to be charged. Here, since the Ack of Order contained subject matter (windows), identity of the parties, price &amp; Windcoâ€™s signature (or on Windcoâ€™s letterhead), SOF is satisfied.</p><p>b. Divisible K. It can also be argued that the contract was a sequence of contracts, each for $100, and that each such K therefore was not within SOF. The $200 would then be for installation services (governed by common law; not UCC) which do not fall within the SOF goods provision. Since the services were to be provided within one year (here: within 60 days), that SOF provision also doesnâ€™t require a writing signed by Sam.</p><p>An enforceable K was formed with terms $200 shipping &amp; installation within 60 days.</p><p>D. Recovery.</p><p>1. Expectation interest. Windco will recover its expectation interest, i.e., the price it expected to obtain under the contract, which was $3,000 + $200 shipping. Even if the court decides the $200 term was not part of the K, Windco will get $3,000.</p><p>2. Consequential &amp; Delay damages. It W can show that it suffered damages as a consequence of not receiving Samâ€™s payment on time, it will be awarded also consequential damages, i.e., those amounts reasonably foreseeable to flow from Samâ€™s breach at K formation time. Here, since Sam is refusing only to pay the $200 (not the $3,000), consequentials shouldnâ€™t apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-4-</p><p><br></p><p>II. Sam v. Windco. A. Recovery</p><p>1. Consequentials. If the court finds that the time to performance was within 15 days, then Sam will recover consequentials (defined supra). Delay damages that both parties knew or should have known would result from Windcoâ€™s failure to install timely would be recoverable.</p><p>B. Breach of implied warranty.</p><p>Each product put into the stream of commerce carries an implied warranty that the goods are suited for their ordinary use. Here, window frames should be suited for use when itâ€™s raining, i.e., not leak[ing].</p><p>1. Parties. Plaintiff must be a purchaser or user. Here, Sam was the purchaser of the windows. Defendant must be one generally in the commercial supply chain. Here, Windco was (see supra under merchants). The parties are proper.</p><p>2. Merchantable. Defined supra. The product was defective due to a manufacturing defect in that the glass didnâ€™t fit properly; thus not fit for ordinary use (not merchantable).</p><p>3. Defenses. Windco will assert that it disclaimed all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Such a disclaimer is effective if conspicuous, as here printed in bold. Sam will however argue his purpose for entering into the K was to obtain windows that were functional and that Windco will be unjustly enriched if allowed to not compensate him so he can obtain other substitute goods (to â€œcoverâ€) &amp; be reimbursed by Windco for his expenses therefor.</p><p>4. Perfect tender rule. Under the UCC, where goods are to be delivered in a single delivery, the buyer (here: Sam) has a right to obtain perfectly conforming goods. Even though Sam didnâ€™t discover the defect (non-conformity) of the goods until later, he can still reject the lot, accept the lot or any portion thereof, upon timely notice to Windco. If Windco still has time under the contract (5 days left from 55 to 60 days) to perform it has a right to cure by replacing the windows.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-5-</p><p><br></p><p>WINDCO v. SAM</p><p>Does the UCC Apply?</p><p>Answer B to Question 1</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼The UCC applies to all contracts for the sale of goods. Goods are moveable, tangible property.</p><p>Here, the subject matter is shown to [be] predominately goods because â€œinstallation comprises 15% of Windcoâ€™s total price.â€</p><p>Therefore, the UCC applies. Merchants?</p><p>A merchant is one who regularly deals in goods of this kind or who, by his occupation, has some special skill or knowledge as to this type of goods.</p><p>Here, â€œWindco manufactures and installs insulated window-frame unitsâ€ and Sam, â€œa commercial dealer,â€ likely has special knowledge of windows.</p><p>Therefore, both parties are merchants.</p><p>Valid Contract</p><p>In order to determine if any rights exist we first must determine if there is a valid, enforceable contract. A contract consists of an offer, acceptance, consideration and lack of formation defenses.</p><p>Offer</p><p>An offer is manifestation of present contractual intent, communicated to an identified offeree, containing definite and certain terms.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s ad will be considered only an invitation to accept offers. When Sam mailed this order form he made an offer to Windco, containing terms (30 window frames @$100/frame). A reasonable person would believe Sam made a commitment to enter a contract because of this information.</p><p>Therefore, there is a valid offer.</p><p>Acceptance and Acceptance With Addition[al] Terms UCC2-207</p><p>An acceptance is an unequivocal assent to the terms of a[n] offer, unlike common law, where the acceptance must be the â€œmirror image.â€ The UCC allows additional terms.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-6-</p><p><br></p><p>At issue here are the terms Sam first added to his offer guaranteeing installation within 15 days. Windcoâ€™s acknowledgment of order altered this term guaranteeing installation â€œwithin 60 days.â€ As between merchants any additional term will become part of the contract unless the contract limits it to its own terms, there is an objection within 10 days, or the term materially alters the contract.</p><p>Here, while Sam wanted installation within 15 days, the question arises if this qualifies as a time is of the essence condition. Because Sam did not object upon receiving Windcoâ€™s acceptance with additional terms, it likely will be held that this is not a material term. And this term will become part of the contract.</p><p>Shipping cost language will not be a material term as â€œshipping costs are customarily borne by the buyer.â€</p><p>Warranty disclaimers are valid if conspicuous and use the term merchantability.</p><p>Therefore, unless a court finds the installation date guaranty to be a material term, all of these terms will become part of the contract.</p><p>Consideration</p><p>Consideration is a legally sufficient, bargained-for exchange.</p><p>Here, there appear to be no consideration issues as Sam is to pay money, Windco is to provide window frames which neither were legally obligated to do.</p><p>Defenses-Statute of Frauds (SOF)</p><p>Under the statute of frauds certain contracts must be evidenced by a writing to be enforceable. Contracts for goods of $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds.</p><p>Such contracts can be taken out of the statute of frauds by performance. Facts here state â€œWindco installed the windo[ws].â€ Therefore, this contract can be taken out of the SOF.</p><p>In any case, because there are documents authenticated by both parties (mail order form by Sam &amp; acknowledgment of order by Windco) that are writings sufficient to bring the contract within the statute of frauds.</p><p>Therefore, the statute of frauds will no[t] prevent this contract from being enforceable.</p><p>Unconscionability</p><p>Unconscionability arises if there can be shown both procedural and substantive unconsc ionabili ty.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s form stated â€œcontract of sale subject to terms herein.â€ Sam may attempt to claim this is substantively unconscionable, however to be procedurally</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-7-</p><p><br></p><p>unconscionable a party must show a lack of bargaining power. Nothing in the facts indicates that Sam could not have purchased window frames elsewhere. Further, to be substantively unconscionable the term must be one-sided. On these facts there is no indication Windco was greatly or significantly in a position to make such a windfall.</p><p>Therefore, unconscionability will fail as a defense. There is a valid enforceable contract.</p><p>Terms and Conditions</p><p>As shown above Windco performed by installing the windows. This condition precedent was fulfilled. It therefore falls upon Sam to meet his obligation or be in breach.</p><p>Breach</p><p>When one does not fulfill their obligation under a contract or excuse a condition they are in breach.</p><p>Here, Samâ€™s refusal to pay the $200 shipping fee is a breach. As noted above, this term became part of the contract because as shown by the usage in trade such a cost is â€œborne by the buyer.â€ Sam must pay the $200.</p><p>At issue here is the disclaimer of warranty discussed above. Often disclaimers of warranty can be material. However, as shown above, this disclaimer met the requirement of â€œbold &amp; conspicuousâ€ type and expressly mentioned â€œmerchantability and fitness.â€</p><p>Therefore, Sam will have no claim under either warranty or merchantability claim or a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. In fact, Sam did not indicate a particular purpose at time of contracting so as to become a basis of the bargain.</p><p>Remedies</p><p>As discussed above, Windco will receive the full contract price plus the $200 shipping fee.</p><p>However, if Sam can demonstrate that the late installation did cause the â€œseveral delay-related expensesâ€ th[at] he claims this will be considered a minor breach (usually timely performance is not a major breach and, as shown above, this contract does not qualify as a â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ contract).</p><p>Therefore, Sam will be able to offset the delay-related costs against the contract price, thus reducing his payment by that amount, because Windco will be found to have substantially performed. The court abhors a waste and will reduce Samâ€™s debt by the difference between what the building now is worth and what it would have been worth if the contract was fulfilled as expected.</p>', NULL, '<p>Windco Vs Sam</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);\">The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract.

Debbie was extremely uncomfortable, but the naked Jon persuaded her to stay and take the first set of pictures.</p><p>On the next day, Jon received the five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures and a letter from Debbie requesting immediate payment of $500, and stating that the five â€œafterâ€ pictures would be taken by her assistant upon notification that Jon had lost 50 pounds.</p><p>Jon consults you and asks the following questions:</p><p>1. Does an enforceable contract exist between Debbie and Jon? Discuss.</p><p>2. Assuming that an enforceable contract exists, can Jon require Debbie to take the â€œafterâ€ pictures personally? Discuss.</p><p>3. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>Answer A to Question 3</p><p>ï¿¼This is a contract primarily for services and will be analyzed using common law principles. Debbie is a photographer and contract is for services - taking the photographs (not for the photos themselves) for common law. UCC rules discussed when they apply only. (Uniform Commercial Code).</p><p>I. Don v. Debbie - Enforceable Contract? A. Formation</p><p>1. Mutual Assent</p><p>a. Offer must contain subject matter, definite terms, and intention to be bound. Here, Jon called Debbie and discussed the 10 photos and their purpose, the terms, and expressed intention to be bound. Offer is valid.</p><p>b. Acceptance. Must be a mirror image agreement to the offer and express the intention to be bound. Here, Debbie accepts Jonâ€™s offer, and both agree to the specific terms.</p><p>c. Consideration. Is a bargained fo r exchange of legal detriment. Here, Debbie agrees to take pictures in exchange for Jonâ€™s payment of money. Consideration is adequate.</p><p>II. Defenses</p><p>A. Statute of Frauds - (SOF) valuable and easily misunderstood contracts must be in writing.</p><p>1) UCC $500 Rule - In order for the contract to be enforceable, it must be in writing if the value of the goods is more than $500 (valuable). Here, under UCC, a writing is necessary. But because this contract is primarily a services contract, it would be enforceable without a writing.</p><p>a. One year rule - Both UCC and Non-UCC. If a contract, at time at formation, cannot be performed within one year, a writing is necessaryforthecontracttobeenforceable. Here,(hopefully) Jon can lose 50# in less than one year, and this rule does not apply. The contract is valid without a written contract.</p><p>b. Impossibility/Impracticability</p><p>If there are intervening events that occur which are unforeseeable, the performance is excused (leg. [sic] illegality destruction of subject matter, death/incapacity of the parties).</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-22-</p><p><br></p><p>Here, Debbie became uncomfortable when she found out that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp. She would try to assert that being uncomfortable once was enough; the second time was impossible for her.</p><p>c. Mistake</p><p>When Ã¢Debbie did not know that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp, Ã£Jon did not tell her that it was a nudist camp, and Ã¤neither party knew (at formation) that Debbie was not comfortable in the nudist camp, there was a mutual mistake. The contract is voidable by either party.</p><p>Unilateral mistake - If Jon could argue that Debbie should ha ve known or asked about certain circumstances that precluded her work, he can prevail on this issue.</p><p>If Debbie can show that Jon should have told her that his spa was a nudist camp, Debbie would prevail. The mistake is chargeable to the more unreasonable party.</p><p>d. Detrimental Reliance - Promissory Estoppel</p><p>Partial performance - Jon would argue that there was a partial performance by Debbie and that he relied reasonably and detrimentally that Debbie would finish the job.</p><p>e. Modification</p><p>At common law, modification requires additional consideration. At UCC, only good faith is necessary. Consideration substitutes can be used, e.g. detrimental reliance, supra. Here, Debbie wishes to modify contract from $1,000 for 10 photos to $500 for 5 photos. She can prevail at common law if she can show additional consideration, or, at UCC, good faith. But Jon has no consideration. This modification is not valid.</p><p>III. Can Jon require Debbie to take â€œafterâ€ pictures?</p><p>A. Delegation of Duty - Courts favor assignment and delegation. The delegation must be with the consent of the obligee or must not be to his detriment. Here, if Jon does not want to give consent for delegation of duty to Debbieâ€™s assistant, he must show that there is diminution in value of the services.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-23-</p><p><br></p><p>B. Personal Services - Contracts are not assignable. If Jon can assert that Debbieâ€™s services were so personal that her duties cannot be delegated, he would prevail. Debbie would argue that photography is not like a portrait and that an equally qualified photographer (such as her assistant) could perform just as well. However, courts are reluctant to enforce specific performance on personal service contracts. Damages would likely be in expectation damages.</p><p>IV. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time?</p><p>A. Express v. Constructive Conditions</p><p>All express conditions must be completely performed to avoid breach. Constructive conditions must be substantially performed to avoid breach. Here, the question would be whether there was an express (v. constructive) condition that the total job would need to be completed before payment in order to avoid breach. The courts wonâ€™t likely construe this to mean the entire contract.</p><p>B. Divisible Contract?</p><p>If Debbie can successfully argue that the contract consisted of 2 parts (before and after) she would be entitled to partial payment for partial performance. This is not a divisible contract and Jon would prevail.</p><p>C. Modification valid?</p><p>No, for inadequate consideration, supra.</p><p>D. Quasi - Contract Recovery</p><p>In order to avoid unjust enrichment the court considers recovery in Quasi-Contracts. Traditionally, only the non-breaching party could recover. In modern law, the breaching party could also recover if the breach were not willful and in good faith. Here, Debbie would be able to recover $500 for value of the before photographs, because her breach was in good faith.</p><p>V. Damages under UCC</p><p>1. Sellerâ€™s breach - When seller breaches, the buyer is entitled to market price minus contract price. Alternatively, buyer can â€œcover.â€</p><p>A buyer is entitled to seek replacement from another buyer and sue the seller for the difference.</p><p>ï¿¼-24-</p><p><br></p><p>Answer B to Question 3</p><p>Enforceable Contract Between Debbie and Jon? Since this is not a contract for goods common law will be the authority. 1. Contract?</p><p>A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty and the breach of which the law will provide a remedy [sic]. It consists of mutual assent and [is] supported by consideration.</p><p>2. Was There an Offer by Debbie?</p><p>An offer is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree such that a reasonable person would conclude that a bargain had been formed. Under common law an offer must include: parties, subject matter, price, and time and quantity. Here the parties are implied because she is â€œstatingâ€ this to Jon.</p><p>The quantity is stated as â€œ5 before pic[ture]s and 5 afterâ€ pictures. The price is â€œ$1,000 dollars and the time is the next dayâ€. Therefore there is a valid offer here.</p><p>3. Acceptance?</p><p>An acceptance is an affirmative assent communicated to the offeror in the manner requested, if not requested then in a reasonable manner. An acceptance to a bilateral offer may be by return promise or by performance.</p><p>Here there is an acceptance because â€œthe parties agreedâ€ that the before pictures would be taken the following day. Therefore Jon assented to the onset of Debbieâ€™s performance.</p><p>4. Consideration?</p><p>Is a bargained-for exchange that causes legal detriment. Here there is consideration because Debbie is promising to take photographs (using her professional skills and time) and Jon is promising to pay Debbie $1,000.</p><p>5. Statute of Frauds?</p><p>The statute requires that certain contracts be reduced to writing to be enforceable. One of these is for goods $500 and over. Although this seems like a contract for Debbieâ€™s services as a photographer, she is also producing tangible moveable goods. The goods were not moveable at the time the contract was formed, however, and therefore the statute would not apply. Therefore a contract exists and</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-26-</p><p><br></p><p>it is enforceable.</p><p>Contract?</p><p>Jon v. Debbie</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Assuming a contract exists, supra, what are the rights Jon may assert?</p><p>Was there an enforceable delegation from Debbie to assistant?</p><p>The law favors delegations. A delegation occurs when one party delegates his duties under an existing contract to a third party.</p><p>Here there is a delegation because Debbie says â€œthe after pictures would be taken by the assistant.â€</p><p>Is the delegation binding on the assistant? A delegation is binding on the delegatee only if they knowingly consent; usually consideration is involved. There are no facts stating whether the assistant consented. One could reasonably assume she was being compensated and consideration would exist.</p><p>Debbie would remain liable for performance as the delegator. Are there exceptions to an enforceable delegation? Exceptions -</p><p>1. Prohibited by contract;</p><p>2. Prohibited by statute;</p><p>3. Too personal in nature.</p><p>Here there may be a valid exception because it could be argued that the artistry of a â€œwell known photographerâ€ is too personal in nature to delegate.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be able to delegate her services. Can Jon demand that Debbie take the pictures?</p><p>Where specific performance would require one to personally perform it will not be enforced based on a prohibition on involuntary servitude.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be forced to perform. She may, however, be enjoined from performing elsewhere during that time.</p><p>Her discomfort may be a factor to rebut based on impracticability. Debbie v. Jon</p><p>If Debbie doesnâ€™t perform is she entitled to partial compensation?</p><p>ï¿¼-27-</p><p><br></p><p>If Debbieâ€™s â€œextreme discomfortâ€ can be shown to make performance impracticable she may be entitled to services already rendered.</p><p>Impracticability exists where a reasonably unforeseeable intervening event, the risk of which was not assumed by either party, makes performance extremely difficult; the duties of the parties may be discharged. Here may be reasonably unforeseeable because â€œit was a nudist camp and Debbie didnâ€™t find out about it until that day. There is no indication she assumed this risk. In order to be successful, she would have to [show] that it would be very difficult to perform the contract. Since â€œJon persuaded her to stayâ€ the first time, it may be difficult.</p><p>She may be able to recover quantum meruit for the services already provided.</p><p>She may argue that there was a divisible contract and recover under this theory. â€œJon received the 5 before picturesâ€ and Debbieâ€™s demand for payment. There is nothing in the contract telling us there is a separate delivery for a separate payment.</p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:26', 1);

For some time, Dan had been plagued by a pathological fear that long-haired transients were trying to kill him. Mistakenly believing that his life was about to be taken, Dan pulled out a handgun and fired the gun, intending only to wound Vic in the legs to prevent the anticipated attack. Rather than inflicting the intended leg wound, the bullet ricocheted off the sidewalk and hit Vic in the heart, killing him instantly.</p><p>1. With what crime or crimes should Dan be charged? Discuss. </p><p>2. What defense or defenses might Dan assert? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>AGGRAVATED ASSAULT</p><p>Answer A to Question 2 STATE V. DAN (D)</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Assault is either a substantial step toward an intended battery or the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm. Modernly, an aggravated assault is an assault committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D shot at Vic (V), intending to wound him. If V was apprehensive of being shot, D will be guilty of assault. Additionally, because D shot at V with a deadly weapon, a gun, D will modernly be guilty of aggravated assault.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated assault. However, the assault will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>AGGRAVATED BATTERY</p><p>Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another. Modernly, a battery is aggravated if it is committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, D intended to wound V by shooting V in the leg. However, the bullet actually killed V by striking him elsewhere. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, D will be guilty of the battery because the intended harm was criminal, and there is great similarity between the intended harm and the harm that actually occurred. Furthermore, because D used a gun to batter V, D will be guilty of aggravated battery.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated battery, though it will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>HOMICIDE OF V</p><p>HOMICIDE is the killing of a human being by another human being. Here, the facts indicate that D killed V by shooting at V with a gun. There is a homicide.</p><p>CAUSATION - ACTUAL CAUSE</p><p>But for D shooting at V, V would not have died.</p><p>CAUSATION - PROXIMATE CAUSE</p><p>It is foreseeable that shooting to someone with intent to injure could result in a death.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼MURDER</p><p>ï¿¼-12-</p><p><br></p><p>Murder is an unlawful homicide committed with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought may be proven under any of four theories.</p><p>1) INTENT TO KILL - Intent requires the conscious desire to cause the criminal result. The facts indicate that D only intended to wound V, not kill V. Thus, D did not have the specific intent to kill.</p><p>2) INTENT TO INFLICT SERIOUS BODILY HARM - Here, the facts indicate that D shot at V with the intent to hitting [sic] V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg is likely to cause serious bodily harm and the facts indicate that D intended to wound V. Under this theory, then, D intended to cause serious bodily harm.</p><p>3) DEPRAVED HEART ACT - A depraved heart act is a wanton and reckless disregard for the value of human life. Here, D shot at V in a public place with an intent to wound V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg present[s] numerous, dangerous risk[s] to his welfare and court[s] normally hold that any act that [is] likely to cause serious harm to others is a depraved heart act if the risk is disregarded.</p><p>4) APPLICATION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE - A killing will be felony if it 1) occurs during the res gestae of a dangerous felony or a felony committed in a dangerous way, 2) is foreseeable, and 3) is independent of the target crime. Here, the State will not bring a charge of felony murder, because the only predicate felonies would merge with the crime. Because of public policy reasons, courts refuse to apply felony murder to felonious assaults and batteries, otherwise, strict liability for first degree murder would result from each killing.</p><p>Having found malice under the theories of 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, the State will proceed as follows.</p><p>FIRST DEGREE MURDER</p><p>First degree murder is an unlawful homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation and specific intent to kill. Premeditation and deliberation may be proven by application of the felony murder rule, or a killing by poison, bomb, torture, or ambush.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D lacked the specific intent to kill and the felony murder rule will not apply. The State will not bring a charge of first degree murder.</p><p>SECOND DEGREE MURDER</p><p>All murder not raised to the first degree shall be second degree murder.</p><p>Here, because the State proved malice under two theories, but did not raise the charge to first degree murder, the State will bring a charge of second degree murder. Because the State established malice under 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, D will be guilty of second degree murder absent a defense.</p><p>D will be guilty of second degree murder.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-13-</p><p><br></p><p>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional homicide committed with malice, but with mitigation. Mitigation may be proven by adequate provocation or mistaken justification.</p><p>Here, D may try to claim that he was provoked into shooting V. However, the first element of adequate provocation requires that a reasonable person be provoked by the conduct. Here, a reasonable person would not have been provoked by Vâ€™s approach, so V may not claim provocation. Additionally, D may claim that his defense of self-defense is imperfect and results in a charge of voluntary manslaughter. As discussed infra, D will raise a defense of self-defense, and this defense will be imperfect. A court may apply this rule of mitigation to lessen the offense to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>The State may bring a charge of voluntary manslaughter. D will be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he succeeds in mitigating his crime by an imperfect self- defense claim.</p><p>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide that results from 1) application of the misdemeanor manslaughter rule, 2) intent to inflict non-serious bodily harm, 3) criminal negligence.</p><p>Here, D will try to mitigate his charge by claiming that the homicide was only involuntary manslaughter. D will claim that he only intended non-serious bodily harm and the killing was accidental. However, court[s] consistently hold that any intent to harm with a deadly weapon infers an intent to inflict serious bodily harm.</p><p>Additionally, D may claim that he was only criminally negligent, not reckless. Dâ€™s claim may work depending on the surrounding situation of the terrain.</p><p>The State may charge D with the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>DEFENSES TO HOMICIDE</p><p>SELF-DEFENSE</p><p>Self-defense [is] the actual and reasonable apprehensions of bodily harm.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he believed V would harm him. However, this belief is not reasonable, because a reasonable person would not have assumed Vâ€™s approach</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-14-</p><p><br></p><p>meant V intended to do harm. Furthermore, D used unreasonable force because V was not threatening any harm.</p><p>Dâ€™s claim of self-defense will fail, but may constitute an imperfect self-defense that mitigates the homicide, as discussed supra.</p><p>INSANITY - Mâ€™NAUGHTEN RULE</p><p>The defendant is entitled to acquittal, if at the time of the crimes and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) did not know the nature or quality of his act, 2) or that his act was wrong.</p><p>Under this rule, D may claim that he believed V was going to attack D and kill D. If D subjectively held this belief, then he would have been permitted to defend himself. Even though this believe was unreasonable, in jurisdictions applying the Mâ€™Naughten rule, D may not have believed his act was wrong.</p><p>D may be able to escape guilt under the Mâ€™Naughten rule.</p><p>INSANITY - MODEL PENAL CODE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if at the time of the crime and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, or 2) did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>Even though D was capable of conforming to the requirements of the law, he may claim that he did not know his act was wrong, because he believed he needed to defend himself. In jurisdictions holding to the MPC insanity position, D would need to prove he did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>D may avoid guilt under the MPC test for insanity.</p><p>IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TEST</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the result of an irresistible impulse that overcame his will.</p><p>Under this test, D would need to prove he was unable to control himself when he shot V. This test would p robably no t provide a defens e becaus e D could h ave controlled himself, he just thought he needed to defend himself.</p><p>D will probably be guilty in jurisdictions applying the irresistible impulse test.</p><p>DURHAM RULE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the product of a mental defect.</p><p>Here, Dâ€™s crime appears to be the product of a mental defect. That is, D believed V would kill D because of a delusion.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-15-</p><p><br></p><p>In the minority of jurisdictions that apply the Durham Rule, D may avoid guilt because the crime was the product of mental defect.</p><p>WELLS-GORSHEN RULE</p><p>Under the Wells-Gorshen rule, insanity defenses that do not give rise to absolute defenses may negate the mens rea requirement of a crime.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he lacked the mens rea to commit murder because he thought V was going to do harm to D. However, under the malice theories, the State proved that D intended to harm V. Even though D thought he was acting in self-defense, he still intended this harm.</p><p>The Wells-Gorshen rule will not apply here.</p><p>DIMINISHED CAPACITY</p><p>Here, D may try to argue that his delusions diminished his capacity to form the intent to commit murder. This rule only applies in a small minority of jurisdictions and usually is applicable only to negate the mens rea of a crime. Here, D is not seeking to negate the mens rea.</p><p>Diminished capacity will not apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-16-</p><p><br></p><p>CHARLES V. DAN</p><p>HOMICIDE CHARGES.</p><p>Answer B to Question 2</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Murder: Murder is the voluntary taking of the life of another with malice. Malice can be shown by perpetratorâ€™s intent to kill, by his being responsible for death during commission of a dangerous felony (â€œfelony murderâ€), by acting in a manner demonstrating a wanton disregard for human life, or by intending to inflict serious injury.</p><p>Here, Dan is on a busy street and is approached by someone he imagines intends to hurt him. Dan is carrying a concealed weapon, a gun, with which he shoots in Vicâ€™s direction intending, he says, â€œonly to wound him,â€ but a ricochet bullet kills Vic.</p><p>-There is clearly a homicide and Dan is clearly the cause. But for Danâ€™s firing, voluntarily, the gun, Vic would not be dead.</p><p>-Intent: First degree murder is a specific intent crime, usually shown by evidence of premeditation and deliberation, or by felony murder. Felony murder is not likely to apply here. Though crimes of carrying [a] concealed weapon and criminal assault might be felonies, the shooting did not occur in furtherance of these crimes. So, premeditation and deliberation are the focus [sic]. A case can be made that Dan premeditated this crime by the fact that he was carrying a concealed gun. Moreover, deliberation can occur in a very short time; even a momentâ€™s deliberation can be enough to sustain the charges. Here Dan thought about his act long enough to consider Vicâ€™s â€œscruffyâ€ appearance to be a threat to him, and to decide to shoot.</p><p>Second Degree Murder</p><p>Intent to inflict serious bodily harm satisfies the malice requirement. Vic shot â€œto wound Vic in the legs.â€ A bullet to the legs is surely serious bodily harm, so Vic can be found to have malice on this basis.</p><p>Likewise, Vicâ€™s shooting a gun on a â€œbusy streetâ€ is likely â€œwanton disregard for human lifeâ€ so that Vicâ€™s malice can be shown to be based upon â€œdepraved heart.â€</p><p>Finally, the killing of a person by â€œdangerous meansâ€ as a lethal weapon, here, a gun, is sufficient to establish intent.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Prosecutor can charge Dan with first degree murder based upon his intent, shown by carrying and firing [a] gun on [a] busy street and his premeditation. Second degree murder included.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Assault and Battery</p><p>ï¿¼-17-</p><p><br></p><p>Criminal assault merges into battery where the threat which constitutes assault occurs simultaneously with the harmful touching required for battery.</p><p>Criminal battery is the harmful or offensive touching of another without consent. The touching may be indirect so long as a physical touching occurs and the object which touches was set in motion by the perpetrator. Here Dan clearly caused the bullet to â€œtouchâ€ Vic in harmful manner.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Vic can be charged with criminal assault and battery. N.B. Legal statutes may result in a gun charge v. Dan. Defenses For Dan</p><p>Justification</p><p>A justification excuses the crime and results in â€œno crime.â€ Here, Dan will argue self- defense as justification. Self-defense excuses a killing if the perpetrator acted reasonably (general intent) and in good faith (specific and general intent crimes) to protect self from serious bodily injury or death and if the actions in defense were proportionate to the threat.</p><p>Here, Dan will argue he only acted to save himself from Vic, whom he believed intended to kill him, and that deadly force was proportionate and justified.</p><p>However, since Vic made no threatening gestures toward Dan and there are facts suggesting Vic was brandishing a weapon, a reasonable person in Danâ€™s position would not have concluded his life was in jeopardy. So Danâ€™s excuse falls in the majority. His â€œgood faithâ€ alone is irrelevant to second degree murder, a general intent crime. In a minority of jurisdictions, if his mistake is found to be in â€œhonestâ€ or in â€œgood faith,â€ the crime may be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Self-defense is not likely available to Dan.</p><p>Excuses:</p><p>Dan will defend saying he did not have the requisite intent for murder.</p><p>He will say he only intended to wound Vic. However, as discussed above, both the specific intent for first degree murder and general intent for second degree are supported by his acts. His intent to do serious bodily harm by wounding Vic with a bullet, the use of a gun, [and] the thinking he did before firing all support Vicâ€™s having requisite intent for murder, arguably first degree.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-18-</p><p><br></p><p>Insanity</p><p>In majority the defense of insanity is established if, at the time of the offense, the perpetrator was suffering from a serious mental defect or disease such that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act or to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law (A.L.I).</p><p>Here, while Dan is described as having a â€œpathological fearâ€ of long -haired persons, we do not know if he has had an established diagnosis of serious mental illness. If he does have such a defect or disease, Dan will have to show that his delusional state was of the kind that anyone believing as he did would have acted in the manner he did or that his disease caused him to lack substantial capacity to understand that he was shooting someone or that it is a crime to do so.</p><p>Involuntary Manslaughter</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another in a state of passion or high emotional arousal caused by a provocation, more than mere words, that would have aroused such emotion in any reasonable person in that position, and that th ere was no time for the person to â€œcool offâ€, and that he did not, in fact, cool off.</p><p>Here Dan will argue that Vicâ€™s coming toward him looking as he did caused Dan to be so afraid that he acted in a state of high emotion.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Danâ€™s arousal is not that which a reasonable person in his situation would experience. Danâ€™s mental illness is not considered in this formulation.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Charges of murder in first degree will lie against Dan, though they may be dropped to second degree murder. Danâ€™s defenses will fail, except possibly the insanity defense, for which we have insufficient information to decide.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:27:41', 1),

For the child to recover against zoo in strict liability she must simply show that the wild animal causing her injury was owned by or under the care of the zoo and that she suffered injury that were [sic] of the type consistent with foreseeable harm by the wild animal.

As zoo is in the business of housing, caring for, and maintaining wild animals, it should be reasonably foreseeable that an accident could arise that would result in an animal being left loose in the nearby community, and because of the nature of a wild animalâ€™s behavior, harm could have resulted to a person in the nearby community. This is particularly true where children are around.</p><p>BreachofDuty. Breachofdutyariseswhendefendantâ€™sactionsdonotrisetothe standard of care required by the law. Here, Learned Handâ€™s approach would note that the zoo breached its duty if the cost incurred with avoiding the harm causing incident was less than the product of the probability of the harm causing incident</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-30-</p><p><br></p><p>arising and the magnitude of loss should the harm causing event occur.</p><p>Here, a fire caused a large water main to break with the ensuing rush of water washing away a portion of the zebraâ€™s pen fence. When considering a pen fence, (as opposed to a sturdy cage), itâ€™s entirely foreseeable that a sudden deluge of water could wash away a portion of the â€œfence.â€ As such, the zoo should have ensured construction of a caged facility that would be sturdy enough to withstand this type of accident.</p><p>The cost involved with the construction of a pen of this nature would be significantly less than the potential danger that a wild animal could cause to men, women, and children in a nearby area should that animal escape. As such, it could be argued that the zoo breached its duty.</p><p>Causation. For liability to arise, the zoo (or in this case, the zooâ€™s employee) would have to be both actual and primary cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Actual Cause. Actual cause arises when â€œbut forâ€ defendantâ€™s actions, plaintiff would not have been injured. Here, the zooâ€™s maintenance employee threw a pile of cleaning rags saturated with a flammable cleaning fluid into a hot, enclosed room. The mainten ance man should ha ve known that there was the potential for the rags igniting resulting in a fire. When this happened, the fire set into motion a series of events that resulted in the zebra getting free and the child being bitten. As such, â€œbut forâ€ the maintenance manâ€™s action, the childâ€™s injury would not have occurred.</p><p>Proximate Cause. Arises when a result is the natur[al] and probable/reasonable and foreseeable consequences of defendantâ€™s actions. Here, we look to see if the injury is of the type reasonably expected, or was significantly more severe than reasonably expected. Here, there was a fire, that resulted in a water main bursting, that resulted in a fence being washed away, that led to a zebra escaping, that resulted in a child being bitten by the zebra. The zoo could reasonably argue that the type of injury resulting to the child was not of the type that would be the foreseeable natural consequence of a fire that caused a water main to break. As such, they could avoid liability as the maintenance manâ€™s actions would not be the proximate cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Defenses. Atcommonlaw,contributingnegligencewasacompletebartorecovery. Here, the zoo could argue that the child was contributorily negligent when she petted the zebra and fed it candy. If the court argued, child would be barred from recovery.</p><p>Comparative Fault. Today, most jurisdictions have adopted comparative fault. Here, the could [sic] would weight [sic] the percentage of responsibility on each of the parties and assess damages accordingly. If child was less at fault than zoo, she could recover accordingly.</p><p>Assumption of Risk. If it can be shown that the child knew the consequences of her actions and knowingly embraced the danger, this could bar her from recovery. This would be a matter of fact for the court to decide.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-31-</p><p><br></p><p>Child v. Zoo Strict Liability</p><p>Answer B to Question 4</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Owners of trespassing wild animals will be held strictly liable (no fault need be shown) for damages proximately caused by the animals.</p><p>Zebra a Wild Animal?</p><p>A wild animal is one that is not domesticated (does not serve man). A zebra is a wild animal because its only use is to be displayed in a zoo. This zebra is from a zoo and thus is considered wild.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>The damage to the child was both actually (BUT-FOR TEST) and proximately (LEGALLY) caused by the zebra because the zebra bit off the childâ€™s fingers [sic]. But for this biting, the child would not have lost his fingers [sic]. There are no superseding causes.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>The child lost his fingers [sic].</p><p>Defense.</p><p>Because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability, the only question is whether Child assumed the risk.</p><p>ASSUMPTION OF RISK requires plaintiff to understand the nature and extent of the risk and to disregard that risk. Here there is no evidence that Child apprehended a risk when approaching the Zebra. Indeed, Childâ€™s offer of candy was a friendly gesture that showed Child probably was comfortable and had no idea that his fingers were in danger.</p><p>Therefore Child did not assume the risk of injury.</p><p>Domestic Animal?</p><p>Zoo could try to claim that, like a horse, a Zebra is a domestic animal, and as such, Zoo would not be strictly liable unless the zebra had known dangerous tendencies. However, this claim should be dismissed because a zebra only looks like a horse; they [sic] are not, however, domesticated.</p><p>Under the facts Child should be able to recover from Zoo in Strict Liability. Negligence?</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-33-</p><p><br></p><p>Negligence is conduct that falls below the standard of care set by law to protect others from unreasonable risk of harm.</p><p>Here Child may also assert a claim in negligence if he can show that Zoo breached an owed duty to him, actually and proximately causing Childâ€™s damages.</p><p>Vicarious Liability</p><p>Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR Zoo will be liable for torts committed by its employees if they act within the scope of their duties.</p><p>Here the maintenance employee was doing his duties, cleaning up, when he threw the rag into the hot room. Zoo will be liable for any tort arising from this act if it is tortious.</p><p>Duty.</p><p>Zoo owes a duty to act as a reasonable zoo. In addition, as possessor of land, they owe a duty not to harm others outside their land by activities on the land.</p><p>Breach.</p><p>Under Cardozo from the Palsgraf decision a duty is owed to all foreseeable plaintiffs, generally within the zone of the activity. Here it is foreseeable that an escaped Zebra would run into civilians and so Zoo was under a duty to be very careful this wouldnâ€™t happen.</p><p>Here Zoo breached this duty in possibly several ways.</p><p>1. First, Child could argue that Zooâ€™s employee was negligent in not realizing that a rag soaked with a flammable liquid could spontaneously combust in a hot enclosed room. This, however, is a poor argument because most maintenance men do not have that understanding of physics and chemistry.</p><p>2. Second, Child could claim that Zoo did not build a strong enough fence to keep the zebras penned in. This is not so strong either because the force from the broken water main probably exceeded any natural force that could reasonably be foreseen. But if the fence was not strong for normal wear and tear Child could show breach here.</p><p>3. A third argument, much better, is that Zoo has a duty to notice when wild animals escape and has ready plans to round them up or tranquilize them if they do escape. Here it seems Zoo did nothing while the zebra ran away.</p><p>Therefore Zoo has breached its duty to control its animals.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>Zoo might claim that the Childâ€™s offer of candy was superseding cause that breaks</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-34-</p><p><br></p><p>the chain of proximate causation. However, Child would have to be doing something independent and unforeseeable for Zoo to prevail. While carrying candy is not a response to an escaped zebra, it is not unforeseeable that a child should have candy, nor is it unforeseeable that such a child might offer it to the zebra.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>Discussed supra.</p><p>Defenses.</p><p>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is conduct by the plaintiff that fails to conform to the standard of care set by law for the plaintiffâ€™s own protection.</p><p>Here a CHILD STANDARD OF CARE applies. Child will be expected to act as a reasonable child of similar age, experience, and education will act in similar circumstances.</p><p>Here Childâ€™s behavior is typical of a â€œyoung childâ€ and is therefore not negligent. ASSUMPTION OF RISK fails for the similar reason as discussed supra. Therefore Child could also recover for his damages under Negligence theory.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:57', 1),

But between merchants a SALES CONFIRMATION by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Furthermore, the UCC provides exceptions for <b>SPECIAL MADE</b> GOODS, where there is an <b>ADMISSION</b> by the party to be bound that there had been an agreement, or where there has been <b>PARTIAL PERFORMANCE</b> of the contract (i.e. acceptance of some or all goods or payment).<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under UCC 2-209 contract modifications must be written to be legally enforceable if the contract, as modified, is for over $500.

Most express terms and promises are considered to be EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS, <b>except for TIME</b> of performance, buyer <b>SATISFACTION</b>, and <b>promises NOT TO ASSIGN</b> the contract which are generally considered mere â€œcovenantsâ€.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If an acceptance forms a contract, for UCC say, </font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under the UCC a contract is enforceable if the <b>QUANTITY</b> and <b>PARTIES</b> are specified. Other terms will be provided by the GAP FILLER provisions of the UCC. All express terms and promises are treated as material terms under the PERFECT TENDER RULE.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>15.&nbsp;Was TIMELY PERFORMANCE a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law the parties may <b>agree at the time of contract execution</b> that <b>timely performance</b>&nbsp;is a MATERIAL CONDITION. Then the condition is called an EXPRESS CONDITION, and typically the contract says, â€œTime is of the essenceâ€.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">But material conditions may also be or <b>implied</b> when the <b>parties knew at the time of execution </b>that <b>tardy performance would deny the non-performing party the BENEFIT OF THE&nbsp;BARGAIN</b>, the benefit expected when they entered into the agreement. In that case the condition is called an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION.</font><br></p><p><b>16.&nbsp;Was Buyer SATISFACTION a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>Under contract law reasonably satisfactory performance by the parties is ALWAYS AN IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract. However, the parties may agree that buyer SATISFACTION is a MATERIAL CONDITION so buyers who are <b>not actually satisfied</b> have no legal duty to pay. </p><p>But if the terms of the agreement do not expressly and unequivocally state that the parties intended for <b>personal</b> satisfaction to be a material condition, the Court will generally hold that a promise of â€œsatisfactionâ€ was merely a â€œcovenantâ€ to perform in a manner that would be satisfactory to a â€œreasonable personâ€ and NOT a material condition UNLESS the service to be performed was one that is highly subject to personal tastes.</p><p><b>17.&nbsp;Does the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE bar evidence of other covenants and terms?</b></p><p>Under the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE evidence of PRIOR or CONTEMPORANEOUS agreements may not be introduced to VARY or CONTRADICT the terms of a <b>FULLY INTEGRATED WRITING</b> unless it is to show evidence of [DAM FOIL] Duress, Ambiguity,&nbsp;Mistake, Fraud, Oral condition precedent, Illegality, or Lack of consideration.

However, the modification may be viewed by the Court as a WAIVER OF CONDITION that the waiving party has a legal right to retract, but the Court may estop the retraction of the waiver of condition to prevent injustice.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>21.&nbsp;Was the contract UNCONSCIONABLE?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b>&nbsp;Under contract law an unconscionable contract will not be enforceable because there is NO REASONABLE FINDING OF INTENT to enter into such a contract. An ADHESION CONTRACT is a â€œtake it or leave itâ€ contract that a party is <b>forced to agree</b> to, and it will often be found unenforceable.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>22.&nbsp;Is DURESS a defense?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law only <b>good faith agreements</b> are enforceable. No contract agreement induced by<b> illegal threats </b>is valid. Likewise, agreements induced by <b>deliberate acts to create threats of economic harm</b> are not enforceable.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">You are unlikely to ever see a question that suggests threats of physical harm because the answer is too easy. But remember that a contract creates legal duties to perform so a threat to breach a contract is an illegal threat. Any agreement that results is the result of â€œeconomic duressâ€ and is unenforceable.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>23. Is FRAUD (or DECEIT) a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition: </b>Under contract law a contract induced through deliberate <b>CONCEALMENT</b> of material facts by a party with a duty to reveal the facts, or by a party deliberately concealing and/or <b>MISREPRESENTING</b> material facts is unenforceable if it can be shown the party seeking to void the contract would never have agreed to the bargain but for the concealment and/or misrepresentation.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>24. Is INCAPACITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;\">&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law a contract cannot be enforced AGAINST one who <b>lacks capacity</b>. EXCEPTIONS are contracts for provision of NECESSITIES of life and where the incapacitated party attains capacity (becomes sane or an adult) and either AFFIRMS or FAILS TO REPUDIATE the contract.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>25. Is ILLEGALITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law, a contract generally cannot be enforced by a party who knowingly entered into it for an<b> illegal purpose</b>.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>26. Is IMPOSSIBILITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law a material condition of every contract is that performance of contract duties must be objectively possible to perform. The inability of a contract party to perform is irrelevant, as long as performance, in general, is possible. But if performance becomes impossible because of events beyond the control of the parties the contract becomes void.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">27. </span><b>Is COMMERCIAL IMPRACTICABILITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">A Court (a judge, in equity) has the authority to declare a contract void if <b>performance by a party</b> would be so <b>financially burdensome</b>, because of events beyond the control of the parties, that it would cause an injustice.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>28. Is FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law, if the parties enter into a contract <b>knowing</b> that the <b>failure of some condition</b> beyond their control will <b>deny one of the parties</b> the <b>benefit of the bargain</b>, that condition is an <b>implied material condition </b>of the contract, the failure of which excuses both parties from the agreement .</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>29. Is MUTUAL MISTAKE a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under PEERLESS when both parties enter into a contract because of a <b>misunderstanding as to a material fact</b>, there is <b>no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€</b> and the contract is <b>void</b> from the beginning.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>30. Is UNILATERAL MISTAKE a defense?</b><br></font>Under contract law, when <b>one party</b> enters into a contract because of a <b>misunderstanding</b> as to a <b>material fact</b> the <b>majority</b> view is that the <b>parties are legally bound</b> to the contract <b>unless</b> the <b>other party knew</b> or should have known of the mistake, and in that case the contract is <b>voidable</b> by the mistaken party. Under a <b>minority</b> view the contract is <b>legally voidable</b> by the <b>mistaken party</b> in any event if they 1) <b>discover the mistake quickly</b> before the other party substantially relies on the contract, 2) give <b>prompt notice</b> of the mistake, and 3) <b>reimburse the other party</b> for any expenses caused by the mistake.</p><hr><p><b>D. Breach</b></p><p><b>31.&nbsp;Was there an ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</b></p><p>(If there is also a WAIVER of the breach, discuss both issues together.)</p><p>Under contract law an anticipatory breach (or anticipatory repudiation) is a <b>CLEAR STATEMENT OR INDICATION</b> that a party <b>WILL NOT PERFORM</b> future contractual duties when they become due. This is a major breach as to those duties, the non-breaching party is EXCUSED from performance of all remaining contractual duties, and the future duties of the breaching party are ACCELERATED to the present.</p><p>If a party has a <b>REASONABLE BASIS</b> to believe the other party may not perform future contractual duties, the party may demand <b>REASONABLE ASSURANCES</b> and <b>REFUSE TO PERFORM</b> until they are provided. Reasonable assurances generally means a <b>financial guarantee </b>or payment into escrow.</p><p> If reasonable assurances are properly demanded and not provided, the <b>failure to respond</b> constitutes an anticipatory breach.<br></p><p><b>32.&nbsp;WAIVER of the breach?</b></p><p>(Discuss if anticipatory breach is ignored by non-breaching party.)</p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under contract law if a non-breaching party lets the breaching party continue performance after a major breach it WAIVES THE BREACH.</p><p>The waiver cannot be revoked, and the non-breaching party is forever ESTOPPED from citing the breach as major and can only cite it as a minor breach.</p><p><b>33.&nbsp;Was there a BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT?</b></p><p>An IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract is that the parties must act in good faith and are bound by an IMPLIED COVENANT that they will <b>act as reasonably necessary to help the other parties enjoy the benefits of the contract</b> and <b>that they will not act in any way to prevent that from occurring</b>.</p><p>A breach of GOOD FAITH or acting in â€œbad faithâ€ means either deceit, concealment or fraud at the time of execution or else the breach of an implied covenant. The mere breach of an express contract promise, even if done deliberately, is not a breach of good faith.</p><p><b>34.&nbsp;BREACH? MAJOR OR MINOR? </b></p><p>(Realize the first party to breach a contract is the breaching party and after that the other party is the non-breaching party no matter what they do later.)</p><p><b>For COMMON LAW say, </b></p><p>Under contract law a BREACH is a failure to perform a contractual duty when it becomes due. A MAJOR BREACH is either an act which deprives the other party of the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN or the violation of an EXPRESS OR IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION by a party, regardless of its effect on the other party. A major breach EXCUSES the non-breaching party from all further performance of contractual duties and ACCELERATES the future contractual duties of the breaching party to the present so the non-breaching party can seek IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES.</p><p><b>For UCC say, </b></p><p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC any shipment of non-conforming goods is a breach of contract.

But after a condition has been waived the waiving party has a legal right to retract the waiver. 39 Nevertheless, a Court of EQUITY may estop the retraction based on considerations of equitable estoppel.

Describe Negligence?</b></p><p>P\'s only cause of action here is <b>Negligence</b>. <b>Definition: </b>Under tort law Negligence is the failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable prudent person would use in the same circumstances. To establish prima facia case P must generally prove <b>Duty</b>, <b>Breach</b>, <b>Actual</b> and <b>Proximate</b> Causation and <b>Damages</b>.</p><p><b>2. Duty?</b></p><p>Generally a person owes no duty to others. But a duty may be based on a <b>Statute</b>, a <b>Contract</b>, a <b>Relationship</b>, the <b>Assumption</b> of a duty, or <b>Peril</b> caused by the defendant.</p><p><b>Negligence Per Se?</b></p><p>If a <b>Statute</b> creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute <b>Negligence Per Se</b> if the purpose of the statute was to protect the <b>Class of People</b> to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent.</p><p>Here D violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused P to suffer injury. But she was not in the <b>Class of People</b> the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people \"on national lands\" and she was \"outside the National Forest boundaries\". Further she did not suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent because it was to \"prevent forest fires and injury\" while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.</p><p>Therefore, P would be unable to prove D was negligent per se.</p><p><b>Duty Based on Peril?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under <b>Palsgraf</b>, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the<b> zone of danger</b> caused by the defendant\'s acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant\'s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.</p><p><b>Definition:</b> Andrews held that if the defendant owes a <b>duty to anyone</b> and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.</p><p>Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because \"no one else was around\" and there was \"nothing that could burn\".</p><p>P appeared to be outside the <b>zone of danger </b>caused by D\'s activities because she was a \"half mile downstream\". P might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the \"gravel bar\" because D should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for P to prove that D had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.</p><p><b>3. Breach?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law a <b>Breach</b> is the failure to exercise <b>Due Care</b>. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances.</p><p>Here D went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone because he went to a \"gravel bar\" in the \"middle of the river\" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers \"carefully\".</p><p>P could only argue that a reasonable observant person would have seen the \"log\" floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than D.</p><p><b>4. Actual Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition:</b> Under tort law an act Actually Causes injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured <b>but for </b>the act.</p><p>Here P would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if D had not thrown the firecracker.</p><p>Therefore, D was the actual cause of P\'s injury.</p><p><b>5. Proximate Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law Proximate cause means that the injury to the plaintiff was <b>foreseeable</b>, <b>close in time and place</b> to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a <b>chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events</b>.</p><p>Generally when there are tow or more actual causes of an injury, <b>the last, unforeseeable intentional act </b>will be an <b>Unforeseeable intervening event </b>that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting of all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are <b>presumed to be unforeseeable</b> absent additional specific facts.</p><p>Here P was rather far away form D in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further, a reasonable person would not foresee that&nbsp; firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if D was the proximate cause of P falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harry\'s criminal act was an <b>unforeseeable intervening event</b>.</p><p>Therefore, P probably could not prove D was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-09-28 01:34:38', 1);

Common law murder is not a specific intent crime. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied by actions that show a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life.

Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time.\" Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December. The final week\'s delay was caused by the photographer\'s not being notified promptly by the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm\'s length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, \"The photograph makes me look too old.

If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties\' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of \"[the customer] and his family,\" the customer\'s availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer\'s duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer\'s delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer\'s recovery, his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct (informing the photographer to \"take the photograph anyway\") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline.

The mother was not a party to the contract between the sister and the brother, so the only way for her to have contractual rights is if she was the intended beneficiary of the contract. For the mother to be an intended beneficiary, she must be the person to whom performance is to be given.

Even if bowling were inherently dangerous, that characterization would support an argument for permitting recreational participants who appreciate the risks of the activity to assume the risks by signing a waiver rather than constituting a reason for ignoring the waiver. \r\n\r\nB is correct. Waivers are most easily justified when an activity poses inherent risks that are familiar to the participants and cannot be entirely eliminated without removing the pleasure from the activity. The risk that materialized here is not inherent to bowling but could arise whenever someone is careless while holding a heavy object. A court might find that it is against public policy to permit individuals or businesses to insulate themselves from the deterrent incentives provided by the threat of negligence liability. For that reason, the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and could hold the waiver ineffective. \r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Although the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and therefore hold the waiver to be no bar when the harm was due to the instructor\'s negligence, asking the woman to sign the waiver was not in itself negligent or unreasonable.

The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender\'s best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor\'s age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law. Because the bartender did not knowingly sell alcohol to the minor, he should be acquitted.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the fact that the purchaser could have presented a fake identification does not excuse the bartender\'s not asking to see it; his only legitimate excuse would be that he believed the person to be over 21 and that the statute includes a mens rea requirement. Answer B is incorrect because ignorance of the law is generally not an excuse, and the bartender\'s not being told that he has to check identification does not affect the offense\'s mens rea requirement. When a crime requires that the defendant act knowingly, he must have been aware that his conduct was of a particular nature, or at least know that his conduct will necessarily or very likely cause a particular result. Here, he must have been aware of the fact that he was selling to a minor, or to someone between the ages of 18 and 21, not the fact that his conduct was violating that regulation.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, again, ignorance of the law is no excuse, and not knowing that beer is an alcoholic beverage does not excuse the bartender\'s actions.

The child\'s death was the result, not of malice aforethought, but of criminal negligence on the part of the father.

Because the death resulted from an untreated illness, and there was no evidence that the father acted with either actual or implied malice toward his child, he is not guilty of murder. Answer C is incorrect because a person is only guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he successfully raises a heat of passion defense to a murder charge. There was no heat of passion defense raised, and, combined with a lack of evidence that the father intended his child to die, he cannot properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter.

The defendant\'s best argument for being found not guilty of felony murder is that he is not responsible for the customer\'s actions in shooting the clerk. The courts are split regarding whether a defendant is liable for felony murder when the death is caused by a third party. Under the proximate cause theory, a defendant can be liable where the innocent party is killed as the result of resistance from the victim or police. However, under the agency theory, the defendant will only be found liable for felony murder when someone is killed by a person acting as an accomplice of the defendant. Given that the customer is neither a victim nor the police, and that the customer is not an agent or an accomplice of the defendant, the defendant\'s best argument is that he is not responsible for the customer\'s actions. Therefore, answer D provides the best possible defense.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because felony murder does not require that the defendant have the specific intent to kill the clerk. It is sufficient that the underlying felony was dangerous and that the killing was foreseeable.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect because attempted robbery, even with a toy gun, is still dangerous enough to be considered a proper underlying felony for felony murder. Arguing that he did not actually complete the robbery is not the defendant\'s best argument for acquittal.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, once again, the defendant\'s intent to create a risk of harm is irrelevant under felony murder. Regardless of his intent that nobody get hurt, he did create a situation by committing a dangerous felony, and, if he bore criminal responsibility for the actor who did the killing, he would be found guilty.

Liability for physical harm to the employee is available provided that: (1) the storekeeper is engaged in the business of selling reconditioned power saws, and (2) the power saw was not substantially changed by anyone else before the employee used it. Based on the facts, both conditions are met, making A the theory on which the employee is most likely to prevail.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The storekeeper made no express representation to the purchaser or the employee about the power saw.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Res ipsa loquitur generally requires that the instrumentality that caused the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant. Here, the saw blade was manufactured by a different company and was being used by the employee, so the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur would be an ineffective theory in this situation.\r\n\r\nD is not the best answer. For the employee to prevail, he must prove that the storekeeper could have reasonably foreseen the danger, that the storekeeper could have minimized the danger, and that the employee could not reasonably have been expected to appreciate and protect himself from the danger.

For a claim based on res ipsa loquitur to prevail, the pedestrian must show that the landlord had exclusive control of the flowerpot before it fell. In this case, the landlord did not have exclusive control of the flowerpot during the relevant time frame because 70 of the units had tenants, so res ipsa loquitur may not be used to establish negligence.

When a party\'s obligation under a contract is subject to a satisfaction condition, generally the party may not avoid liability simply by expressing dissatisfaction with the performance - the dissatisfaction must be expressed either reasonably or in good faith, depending on the nature of the obligation. Where the performance at issue involves aesthetic taste and judgment (such as an obligation to take a family portrait or holiday photo), the party whose obligation to pay is subject to the condition may only express dissatisfaction honestly, or in good faith.

The bakery did all of its weekly bread baking on Tuesdays. On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler\'s assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender.\r\n\r\nWas the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?', 'Answer B is correct. UCC Â§ 2-612(2) provides that a buyer may reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. The delivery of less than the contracted-for amount constituted a nonconformity that substantially impaired the value of the installment since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs, and the bakery was entitled to reject the tender.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, but that rule is inapplicable to assess the conformance of a seller\'s performance under an installment contract. Because this is an installment contract, the substantial impairment standard governs the buyer\'s right to reject, and the bakery is entitled to reject under that standard. Under the substantial impairment standard, an installment can be rejected by the buyer only if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured. Furthermore, the whole contract is breached if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of the entire contract.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. UCC Â§ 2-612(2) provides that a buyer is entitled to reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. A buyer\'s right to reject a particular installment is not dependent on a substantial impairment of the entire contract. Moreover, in this case, the wholesaler\'s assurance of cure was inadequate since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. As stated above, a buyer\'s right to reject a delivery on an installment contract for the sale of goods is not governed by the perfect tender rule, but rather by the substantial impairment standard. Here, the bakery had the right to reject the second installment because the missing 5,000 pounds of flour could not be delivered for several days, substantially impairing the installment.

The facts indicate that the stove arrived exactly as it was designed. This is a defective design case.

The landowner\'s mini-golf business had greatly declined as a consequence, and the value of his property had gone down markedly.\r\n\r\nIs the landowner likely to prevail?', 'Answer C is correct. To succeed in a nuisance action, the plaintiff must show that the defendantâ€™s activity has substantially and unreasonably interfered with the plaintiffâ€™s use and enjoyment of his property. The evidence that there has been a significant decrease in the value of the landownerâ€™s property and that his business is suffering a marked decline would support a claim that the intrusion by the gas company is both substantial and unreasonable.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. A showing of negligent behavior on the part of the defendant is not required to prevail on a nuisance claim. Instead, the plaintiff must show that the defendantâ€™s activity has substantially and unreasonably interfered with the plaintiff\'s use and enjoyment of his property. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. The character of the neighborhood may be considered in evaluating whether a property owner has created a nuisance, but compliance with zoning requirements does not defeat a nuisance claim if the defendantâ€™s activity substantially and unreasonably interferes with the landownerâ€™s use and enjoyment of his property, which appears to have happened in this case.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect.

The call of the question wants you to find the answer that is NOT a substantial issue. The operation of a nuclear power that contains highly toxic chemicals/ radioactive vapor is considered an abnormally dangerous activity. Ultra-hazardous activities give rise to strict liability because the inherent danger or peculiar risk is unreasonably high when compared to its social utility, even in the absence of negligence and where all the proper precautions have been taken.

The prisoner brought an action against the photographer for intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best argument that the photographer can make in support of a motion for summary judgment?', 'D is the correct answer. A motion for summary judgmentwill be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For the prisoner to prevail in his claim for intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress, he must show that: (1) the photographer\'s intentional (with purpose or knowledge to a substantial certainty) or reckless disregard for the consequences of publishing the photograph was (2) extreme and outrageous conduct, which (3) caused the prisoner severe emotional distress. Thus B is incorrect because severe emotional distress can be evidenced physically, but physical harm is not required. The photographer clearly pointed his lens to take a picture, knowing to a substantial certainty that the mobster and his companions would be photographed as a result, so choice A will not help the photographer. In addition, the issue of a reporter\'s privilege to photograph is a disputed material fact which gives rise to a question for the jury, so choice C will not support the photographer\'s motion for summary judgment. Choice D addresses the element of outrageousness that is not answered in the fact pattern and which is an objective standard that can be determined as a matter of law. Thus, D is the best answer because it gives the photographer the strongest grounds upon which he can support his motion for summary judgment. Therefore, A, B and C are incorrect.', '2017-09-16 16:06:22', 1, '[\"No reasonable person could conclude that the photographer intended to photograph the prisoner.\",\"The prisoner did not suffer any physical injury arising from the emotional distress.\",\"As a news photographer, the photographer was privileged to take photographs that others could not.\",\"No reasonable person could conclude that the photographer\'s conduct was extreme and outrageous as to the prisoner.\"]', 3, 'Intentional Torts'),

The owner of the plant has imposed strict safety measures to prevent an explosion at the plant. During an unusually heavy windstorm, a large tile was blown off the roof of the plant and crashed into a passing car, damaging the hood and the windshield. The driver of the car brought a strict liability action against the owner of the plant to recover for the damage to the car. \r\n\r\nIs the driver likely to prevail?', 'Answer A is correct. Although the manufacture of explosives may be an abnormally dangerous activity, strict liability for injuries caused by such activities is limited to the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. This accident could have occurred when a roof tile fell from a building that housed a perfectly safe and ordinary activity. The owner may, however, be liable for negligence. Thus, Answer A is correct and Answer C is incorrect. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the driver is not likely to prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The fact that the windstorm was unusually severe may be relevant to a negligence claim, where the case would turn on whether the owner took reasonable precautions to prevent the accident, but it is not relevant to a claim of strict liability. The strict liability claim fails because the risk that materialized was not of the sort that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. \r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Strict liability is based on the abnormally dangerous nature of the activity and is limited to the realization of the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. The inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on may be one factor in deciding whether the activity is abnormally dangerous, but it is not the only factor.

He often placed merchandise on the sidewalk, sometimes for short intervals, sometimes from 7:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Pedestrians from time to time stopped and gathered to look at the merchandise. A man had moved into an apartment which was situated immediately above the store; a street-level stairway entrance was located about twenty feet to the east. On several occasions, the man had complained to the store owner about the situation because not only were his view and peace of mind affected, but his travel on the sidewalk was made more difficult. The man owned and managed a restaurant two blocks to the west of his apartment and made frequent trips back and forth. There was a back entrance to his apartment through a parking lot; this entrance was about two hundred feet farther in walking distance from his restaurant. Once the man complained to the police, whereupon the store owner was arrested under a local ordinance which prohibited the placing of goods or merchandise on public sidewalks and imposed, as its sole sanction, a fine for its violation.\r\n\r\nOne day, the sidewalk in front of the store owner\'s store was unusually cluttered because he was cleaning and mopping the floor of his shop. The man and his fifteen-year-old son saw a bus they wished to take, and they raced down the stairs and onto the cluttered sidewalk in front of the store, the man in the lead. While dodging merchandise and people, the man fell. The son tripped over him and suffered a broken arm.

Although public nuisances generally must be prosecuted by public authorities, a public nuisance action by a private party is possible if the public nuisance causes a unique harm to the plaintiff that differs from the general harm to the public. The remedy for the public nuisance is usually damages. In this case, the man is asking for injunctive relief, which only is granted where damages are an unavailable or inadequate remedy. Since the man has alleged no injury for which damages (compensation for the injuries and a fine) would be inadequate, an injunction would probably be denied. Therefore, D provides the best defense for the store owner.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. A claim for nuisance does not have to be mitigated by removal, and remaining in proximity to the nuisance is not implied consent.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The issue is whether the interference with the safety and property rights of the community was unreasonable, not whether the violation of the ordinance was reasonable.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect as there is no remedy of self-help available to the man.

The mother is an invitee, since she entered the premises under the hospital\'s implied invitation. Therefore, the hospital has a duty to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition for her use. Thus, A and D can be eliminated immediately; A because the mother\'s status as an invitee does not make the hospital automatically liable for her injuries while on premises, and D because the hospital does owe an affirmative duty to a business/public invitee to protect the hospital patrons against known and discoverable hazards. B is also incorrect because whether the fixture was obvious is irrelevant.

Any duty that the landlord may have is at most a duty to act reasonably. Because the landlord had no reason to know that the dog posed a risk to those on his property, his failure to take precautions against that risk was not negligent. \r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The possessor of a vicious dog may be strictly liable to those injured by the dog, but the landlord here is not in possession of the dog. Moreover, the liability, where it exists, is limited to cases in which the possessor has reason to know that the dog is unusually dangerous. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. A landlord may have a nondelegable duty to protect persons who come upon the land from dangerous conditions of the property, such as cracked walks and broken stairs, but the presence of a dog that belongs to a tenant is not such a condition.

Because the sports car performed exactly as it was designed to perform, this is a defective design case. For strict liability to apply in defective design, the driver must prevail in a risk-utility balancing test where she must show that the risk and severity of her injuries were predictable to her as the driver of the sports car. In some jurisdictions, the court would then consider the feasibility of alternative designs. Other jurisdictions shift the burden to the defendant (once plaintiff proves causation) requiring the manufacturer to show that the utility of the design outweighs the inherent danger. The driver provided evidence that an alternative engine design of equal cost and performance was possible without the stalling flaw. Under the facts, the judge could find that the driver met her burden to show injury to herself as the result of a design flaw that was not technologically and economically burdensome for Rapido Company to correct. A directed verdict (also called Judgment as a Matter of Law) allows judgment if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that a reasonable person/jury could not disagree. Therefore, the defendant\'s motion should be denied, and A is the best answer.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The issue before the judge was whether the driver met her burden of proof in a defective design case.

The airline company sued the delivery service based on a theory of the tortious interference with its contract. The tort of interference with contract provides a cause of action against those who improperly interfere with the performance of a contract between the plaintiff and a third person. In this case, the airline and the delivery service were parties to a contract, and any action between them would be based on the contract, rather than on tort. The proper defendant in the tort action would be the food company. See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 766. \r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the airline will not prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The airline could sue the food company for tortious interference even though it was not in privity with the food company, but it did not do so. It sued the delivery service instead.

Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not.

The pedestrian\'s attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver\'s license expired two years prior to the collision.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the driver to have a valid driver\'s license has which of the following effects?', 'B is correct. In a negligence case, a plaintiff must establish that a duty of care was owed and that a breach of that duty occurred. Typically these elements are analyzed through common law principles. In some instances a statute may provide for the standard of care which should be used instead of the default common law duty. For a statutory standard of care to exist, two things must be true: (i) the harm that occurred was the type of harm that the statute was designed to protect against, and (ii) the plaintiff was of the class of people that the statute was designed to protect. If a statutory duty of care exists, then a violation of the statute would satisfy the elements of duty and breach in a negligence case. Courts sometimes call this negligence per se. Negligence per se, however, does not automatically furnish liability for negligence because the remaining elements of causation and damages must also be proven by the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nA majority of courts have held that a violation of a licensing statute does not constitute negligence per se. The courts have reasoned that unlicensed driving is not equivalent to negligent driving. The purpose of a driver\'s license is for registration and identification of drivers.

The gun cabinet was normally locked. The grandmother had opened it for dusting several days before the boys\' visit, and had then forgotten to relock it. She was not aware that it was unlocked when the boys arrived. \r\n\r\nAt the trial on an action against a grandmother on behalf of the friend, the information above has been admitted into evidence. If the grandmother moves for a directed verdict in her favor at the end of the friend\'s case, that motion should be', 'D is the correct answer. A directed verdict (also called Judgment as a Matter of Law) allows judgment if the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, is such that a reasonable person/jury could not disagree. A directed verdict is entered at the close of the evidence before the matter goes to a jury. There are two potential claims at issue in this question. The first is whether the grandmother can be held vicariously liable for the grandson\'s tortious act. The grandmother has a duty to exercise reasonable care in the control of the grandson while he is physically within her care or custody. Liability, however, is generally limited to actions that were a known propensity of the child, and thus, foreseeable by the caretaker. A custodian of a child who fails to exercise control regarding the known propensity of that child is generally not vicariously liable for the child\'s tortious behavior; rather the caretaker is liable for his or her own negligence in failing to control the child. The facts clearly indicate that the grandson\'s behavior was not foreseeable to the grandmother.\r\n\r\nThe second issue, however, is whether the grandmother had a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff to take affirmative measures that would keep her grandson from using the gun. When the grandmother failed to remove the bullets from a stored gun and then forgot to relock the gun case, it was foreseeable that her grandson would find and play with the gun; she thereby failed in her duty to control the grandson\'s use of a dangerous instrumentality.\r\n\r\nA is the wrong conclusion. While the grandmother may not generally be liable for her grandson\'s tortious activities, she is liable for her own negligence.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. The negligence occurred when the grandmother failed to remove the bullets from the gun and lock the cabinet, not several days later, when she failed to recall that she did not lock it.\r\n\r\nC reaches the correct conclusion but not the best answer. When the grandmother failed to remove the bullets from a stored gun and then forgot to relock the gun case, it was foreseeable that her grandson would find and play with the gun, thus failing in her duty to control the grandson\'s use of a dangerous instrumentality.

Parking restrictions in front of fire hydrants are to ensure access to fire department vehicles, not to protect against roadside accidents, so negligence per se is improperly invoked here.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect.

Mental disability does not generally provide immunity for intentionally tortious conduct. The call of the question asks which supported claim would be the defendant\'s best defense. The issue, however, is which of the defenses addresses whether the defendant had formed the intent necessary to complete the battery.

Trespass is the physical invasion of the real property of another, the intent to bring about that invasion, and causation. Intent refers only to the intent to enter the land; the defendant need not know that the land belongs to the plaintiff. Therefore, if the defendant intentionally drove his car onto the plaintiff\'s land, this would provide a sufficient basis for a trespass claim.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. Damage to the plaintiff\'s land by the defendant\'s property is not sufficient to sustain a claim of trespass because it does not establish intent of the part of the defendant.

Any user who is injured by a defective product can bring a products liability claim based on strict liability in tort as long as they can satisfy the requirements for the prima facie case. The four elements of the case are: (1) a strict duty owed by a commercial supplier, (2) breach of that duty, (3) actual and proximate causation, and (4) damages. In a products liability claim, the main difference between a negligence and strict liability claim is that the negligence standard of care is replaced with an absolute duty to make safe. In a strict liability case, the plaintiff need only prove that the product was unreasonably dangerous to show a breach of duty. Thus, in contrast to a negligence action, a retailer in a strict liability action may be liable simply because it was a commercial supplier of a defective product.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in a strict liability claim, the product must be expected to, and must in fact, reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is supplied. In this case, since the college student removed and disposed of the box containing the adequate warning before the shampoo reached the roommate, the product was substantially changed from the condition in which it was sold, and there is not adequate causation to sustain the roommate\'s claim.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The roommate\'s misuse of the product would not provide a defense to a strict liability action in a jurisdiction that maintains traditional contributory negligence rules. Even if the misuse rose to the level that the roommate was contributorily negligent, this is not a defense where the plaintiff simply failed to recognize the danger or guard against its existence. Therefore, B is also incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because privity is not required in a products liability claim based on strict liability, the injured party must only be a foreseeable user.

A guest of the hotel fell into the excavation, which the contractor had negligently left unguarded.\r\n\r\nIn an action by the guest against the hotel to recover for his injuries, what would be the most likely outcome?', 'Answer A is correct. Ordinarily, someone who hires an independent contractor would not be vicariously liable for the contractor\'s negligence. However, a landowner who holds his land open to the public has a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business visitors. Such a landowner is liable for any negligence that causes a guest to be injured by unsafe conditions on the premises, even the negligence of an independent contractor.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. While it is true that the hotel would most likely be liable, the contract between the hotel and the contractor is irrelevant to the hotel\'s potential liability to the guest. Should the guest successfully sue the hotel, the contract would allow the hotel to bring an action for indemnification against the contractor, but the contract does not affect the hotel\'s liability to its guests. The hotel\'s liability, as stated above, would arise from its nondelegable duty to the guest to keep a safe premises.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Because the hotel had a nondelegable duty to keep the premises safe for business visitors, the court will hold the hotel liable for the contractor\'s negligence, whether that negligence was active or passive.

If the hotel had not exercised reasonable care in selecting a contractor, that would be an alternative basis for imposing liability on the hotel.

A qualified privilege exists between employers about an employee, however, provided the statement was not made with the knowledge it was false or with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity.

The ladder was left upright against a home where the family was away on a trip, in plain view for any thief to see. The roofer had a duty of ordinary care to remove his equipment, and it was certainly foreseeable that leaving the ladder at an unoccupied home would potentially result in its use as the instrumentality for a break-in. The burden to remove the ladder was slight compared to the potential severity of the harm. Because the roofer created a foreseeable risk, his liability is not cut off by the thief\'s intentional intervening act. Therefore, C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The roofer did not become a trespasser by leaving the ladder on the owner\'s property. His license to be on the property did not expire until his job was completed, which would include removal of his equipment. Thus, the issue of whether the roofer has a trespasser\'s liability for any damage caused to the owner\'s property does not apply.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect. This answer choice is meant to distract and confuse. This is not a contracts issue. The contract involved the making of repairs to the roof. Those repairs, according to the fact pattern, were completed, so despite the red-herring phrase \"workmanlike manner,\" breach of contract is not in issue here. Rather, the issue here is negligence by the roofer during the removal of his equipment.', '2017-09-17 13:57:42', 1, '[\"Yes, because by leaving the ladder the roofer became a trespasser on the owner\'s property.\",\"Yes, because by leaving the ladder, the roofer created the risk that a person might unlawfully enter the house.\",\"No, because the act of the thief was a superseding cause.\",\"No, because the owner\'s claim is limited to damages for breach of contract.\"]', 1, 'Negligence'),

In an action brought by the customer against the store, these are the only facts in evidence.\r\n\r\nShould the trial judge permit the case to go to the jury?', 'Answer B is correct. Unlike slip-and-fall cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana peel does not indicate that it has been on the ground for any significant period of time. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support a jury verdict that the store staff was negligent in failing to remove it before the customer\'s fall.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the judge should not let the case go to the jury, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. In slip-and-fall cases, even if a customer was negligent, he could recover some of his damages under a system of pure comparative negligence if a jury determines that the grocer was also negligent. The case at issue, however, should not go to the jury, because there is no evidence to support a finding of negligence on the part of store staff, as explained above.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Strict products liability is not applicable here because the banana was not defective. Moreover, the case at issue should not go to the jury, because there is no evidence to support a finding of negligence on the part of store staff. The fact that the peel came from a banana offered for sale by the grocer is not evidence of negligence. Unlike cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana in the present case indicates that it had not been on the floor for a significant amount of time. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support a jury verdict that the store staff was negligent in failing to remove it before the customer\'s fall.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect. Foreseeability alone is not sufficient to establish that the grocer was negligent. The plaintiff must also offer evidence that the grocer fell below the standard of care, i.e., that he failed to adopt the precautions that a reasonably prudent person in his situation would adopt to avoid the foreseeable risk. There is no such evidence here. Moreover, unlike cases in which res ipsa loquitur is appropriate, the condition of the banana in the present case indicates that it had not been on the floor for a significant amount of time.

Generally, there is no affirmative duty to act. However, four exceptions exist: (i) if the defendant voluntarily assumes a duty, (ii) if the peril was caused by the defendant\'s own conduct, (iii) if a special relationship exists between the parties; and (iv) if the defendant has a duty to control a third party. A person assumes a duty to act by voluntarily beginning to aid someone in peril. Once aid has begun, the actor has a duty to use reasonable care in continuing to administer aid. Here A is incorrect because there is no general duty to act to help a stranger, and there has been no assumption of duty either.\r\n\r\nB and C are also incorrect because, although there is a duty to act within a special relationship, neighbor and cousin generally do not fall within the category unless especially close or special for an additional reason. Common examples of special relationships that owe a duty of care are parent-child, employer-employee, common carriers and innkeepers, and parties in privity such as through contract.\r\n\r\nD is the correct answer because the defendant\'s own conduct gave rise to the situation of peril, creating an affirmative duty to aid or assist.

The pedestrian was also aware that past windstorms had blown slates off the roof.\r\n\r\nIf the pedestrian sues the seller to recover damages for his injuries, will the pedestrian prevail?', 'B is correct. The seller had a duty of reasonable care for the safety of those outside the land to prevent harm resulting from conditions on the land. The facts indicate that ordinary windstorms had previously caused tile loss. Despite the fact that the seller just sold the home, he was or should have been aware of the dangerous condition of the roof and the foreseeability of harm to persons outside the premises from windswept falling tiles. Instead, he left the dangerous conditions without taking precautionary measures to protect against dislodged tiles. It is irrelevant that the seller was no longer the owner or occupier of the house; the seller\'s negligent conduct was a breach of his duty of care and proximately caused the pedestrian\'s injuries, thus choice C is incorrect.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. This is not a products liability issue; it is a failure to exercise reasonable care issue. The seller was a negligent user/owner of a property, not a manufacturer of a defective product. Thus, the pedestrian must assert a claim for negligence, not strict liability. The seller is still liable for his own negligent conduct as it affected the house, even if he has just sold the property at issue. (If the sale had occurred some time earlier such that the new owner had time to observe the problem, however, then the seller would no longer be liable for the original condition of the roof. The new owner would have had a duty to repair the roof once he had time to discover the dangerous condition.)\r\n\r\nD is incorrect.

A private nuisance is substantial and unreasonable interference with a possessor\'s use or enjoyment of his property.

In making this determination, the court will consider the neighborhood, land value, and alternative courses of conduct for the defendant.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, the interference is unreasonable because the injury outweighs the utility of the feed lot. Due to the growth of the city, there are now a substantial number of residences near the feed lot. Furthermore, while the cattle company\'s land is worth $300,000, the company has only invested $25,000 in the establishment of the feed lot, and is severely impairing the use of between $125,000 to $200,000 worth of residential property.

Inverse condemnation is a property action brought by the owner against a government entity that has taken the owner\'s property without the use of formal condemnation proceedings. The cattle company is not a government entity.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Generally, if the purchaser bought in good faith, the purchaser is entitled to the reasonable use or enjoyment of the land.

About 5 minutes later, and while the man was still in the bank, a driver was driving down the street. The driver swerved to avoid what he mistakenly thought was a hole in the street and sideswiped the man\'s car.

Negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. The driver had a duty to drive with ordinary care, and breached that duty by sideswiping a parked car and damaging the fire hydrant. Therefore, the issue here is causation. The driver was the cause-in-fact of the damage because but for the driver\'s sideswiping of the man\'s car, the car would not have overturned onto the hydrant and caused damage. Likewise, the driver is the proximate cause of the damage because the resulting damages were a foreseeable result of the driver\'s negligence.

When the neighbor came over the fence, the rancher shot him, inflicting serious injury.\r\n\r\nIn a battery action brought by the neighbor against the rancher, the rancher testified that he actually thought his neighbor was armed, although he could point to nothing that would have reasonably justified this belief.\r\n\r\nIs the neighbor likely to prevail?', 'Answer D is correct. While the rancher\'s belief that deadly force was necessary to protect himself from harm may have been actual, it was not reasonable. To justify the use of force sufficient to cause death or serious bodily injury, a defendant must have more than a subjective suspicion that such force is necessary. A defendant must have an actual and reasonable belief that he himself is threatened with force of that sort. In this case, the rancher\'s belief that the neighbor was armed was not reasonable, nor did he have a reasonable belief that the neighbor meant to harm him. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer B is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The majority of states that recognize a right to stand one\'s ground rather than retreat limit the right to an owner who is confronted in his home, not one simply standing outside on land that he owns. Also, even if the rancher had no obligation to retreat, he used deadly force, which was not justifiable unless he had a reasonable belief that he himself was threatened with that degree of force and needed to use deadly force to defend himself. The disparity in numbers here, as well as the fact that the rancher\'s belief that the defendant was armed was not supported by any evidence, indicate that his decision to shoot was unreasonable.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. It is true that force sufficient to cause serious bodily injury cannot be used to protect property, but a property dispute can escalate to a situation in which the participants are in danger of bodily harm. In this case, the rancher will argue that he feared that the neighbor was going to shoot him. If he reasonably feared the use of deadly force against his person, he could respond with the same degree of force even though the dispute began as a fight over property.

Parking restrictions in front of fire hydrants are designed to provide access for fire department vehicles, so the invocation of the statute is inappropriate here.

Damages for lost opportunities may be recoverable in some cases as consequential damages for a breach of contract.

Each invoice was silent in regard to any discount from the price for prompt payment. The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery.

This question doesn\'t raise an issue of waiver or retraction of a waiver, because there is no indication that payment within 15 days at a 5% discount is inconsistent with the parties\' agreement. In fact, the seller\'s invoice is silent on the matter. Instead, the question goes to the meaning of the agreement made by the parties.

The general rule is that a repudiating party may retract its repudiation. An attempted retraction is ineffective, however, if it occurs after the injured party has materially changed its position in reliance on the repudiation. The buyer\'s purchase of the second tract as a substitute for the first tract, which occurred before the seller\'s attempted retraction, constituted a material change in position and thus terminated the seller\'s ability to retract his repudiation. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. Ordinarily in a real estate transaction the tender of the purchase price and of the real property are to occur simultaneously. Here, however, the seller\'s repudiation and the buyer\'s subsequent action in reliance on the repudiation discharged the buyer\'s obligation to tender the purchase price on July 1. \r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect.

Pursuant to that promise, the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on May 1, 2001, and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof:\r\n\r\nThe contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by the father, and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $18,000. The father agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1, 2001, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met.\r\n\r\nThe contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001, when he also began building the house. The father made three $2,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September 2001, without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 2001, to the end of February 2002, because of bad weather, and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1, 2002, the contractor demanded payment of $2,000, but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe contractor failed to object to the father\'s failure to make payments on November 1, December 1, January 1, and February 1. Additionally, the father made payments in August through October without requiring a certificate from Builders. What was the probable legal effect of these actions?', 'B is correct. The condition in the contract fixing the time for payment was not a material part of the agreed exchange and therefore was subject to repeated waiver when the contractor failed to object as each of the four months passed without payment. By doing so, the contractor voluntarily abandoned this contractual condition for these months. The condition requiring a monthly certification prior to payment was waived by the father each time he made monthly payments without requiring certification. However, the father would be permitted to revoke the waiver and reinstate the certification condition as to future payments if he allowed the contractor reasonable time to obtain the certificates and if the contractor had not detrimentally relied upon the waiver.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. Neither the contractor nor the father, by failing to assert the condition, caused the other to detrimentally rely on the fact that the condition would not be asserted. As to the contractor\'s failure to demand monthly payment, he had done no work during these months due to bad weather, and this would not indicate that he would not demand payment when he once again began working. As to the father\'s waiver of certificate each month, the father retained the ultimate right to inspect before taking possession; thus, the contractor could not have detrimentally relied upon the failure to issue certificates.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect. The contractor and the father did not make an agreement to rescind; this would be necessary given the fact that their waivers of condition resulted in the contract remaining enforceable.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect.

Under the Statute of Frauds, a promise to sell an interest in land must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute to be enforceable. Although the land contract provision of the statute has been broadly construed to include rights of way, the neighbor-landowner agreement does not fall within the land contract provision because the neighbor\'s promise (\"permitting the digging\") was a gratuitous conveyance and not a contract for sale. Similarly, a promise that cannot be performed within a year of its making falls within the one-year provision of the statute. Because the landowner-builder agreement was made on March 1 and the performance is to be completed by June 1, this agreement falls outside the one-year provision since it can be performed within a year of its making.

This rule is intended to protect the substantial reliance of the offeree that results when accepting an offer for a unilateral contract by performance over a period of time.

The contract contained the following provision: \"It is understood and agreed that the purchaser\'s obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of said apartment house.\"\r\n\r\nWhich of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?', 'C is correct. This question deals with the distinction between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent, and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions that can occur together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. Therefore, each condition acts as a condition precedent to the other. Finally, a condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs. C is the least accurate statement because the purchaser\'s tendering of good title to the farm does not excuse the building owner\'s duty to convey good title to the apartment house.\r\n\r\nHere, the building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser, and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner, or no further duty arises for either party. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after), the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment.

The subcontractor then breached by unjustifiably refusing to perform further.

A party in breach generally is entitled to restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the way of part performance in excess of any loss to the non-breaching party resulting from the breach. In measuring restitution to the breaching party, the value of the benefit conferred should not exceed the contract price for such services. The subcontractor appears to have entered into a losing contract, since the value of the services rendered up to the time of breach ($150,000) exceeds the contract rate for such services ($100,000). But because the subcontractor was the breaching party, he is not entitled to recover the amount by which the reasonable value of his services exceeded the contract rate; rather he is limited to restitution of what he would have earned on the contract.\r\n\r\nBecause the subcontractor has already been given progress payments of $100,000 for the work, there is no basis for restitution to the subcontractor.

A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to a duty. Constructive conditions of exchange can be waived through conduct, by treating a breach as only a partial breach and continuing to perform the contract. Although a waiver may be retractable in certain situations, a waiver is not retractable once the non-waiving party has relied on the waiver. When the corporation accepted only two game-designs per year during the first three years of the contract, the corporation implicitly waived the computer whiz\'s breach of the annual-quantity term of the contract. The computer whiz relied on this waiver when he spent substantial sums on equipment for future design work.

The victim of a breach is entitled to recover only those damages which could not reasonably have been avoided. Failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages defeats only a claim for consequential damages. It does not deprive the victims of the breach of the opportunity to claim damages measured by the difference between contract and market price.

However, consideration is required for a settlement to be enforceable. Under the preexisting duty rule, the creditor\'s promise to forbear from suing to collect was not supported by consideration from the debtor, because the amount due was liquidated and the debtor promised to do nothing more than he was already obligated to do.

Unconscionability has been defined as including both procedural and substantive elements: procedural unconscionability refers to defects in the bargaining process that leave a party with no meaningful choice, and substantive unconscionability refers to contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed in light of the situation existing at the time that the contract was made, it appears that both elements are present here: the landholder was in desperate financial straits and ignorant of the value of the rights that he was selling, and the terms of the contract grant timber rights to the logger for a price that is 70% below the market rate. A is incorrect because the mere fact that the logger won the contract with a below-market bid does not suggest bad faith. B is incorrect because there is no evidence of a statement of fact that would give rise to an estoppel. D is incorrect because, in order to show duress, the landholder would need to show that the logger induced the landholder to make the contract by making a wrongful threat (which on these facts the logger did not do).', '2017-09-26 09:20:08', 1, '[\"Bad faith.\",\"Equitable estoppel.\",\"Unconscionability.\",\"Duress.\"]', 2, 'Defenses to Enforceability'),

But if Hunter was shooting at something else, whether it was a real deer or not, missed and hit Farmerâ€™s cow by accident it would not be an intentional tort. In that case it would be negligence and (B) would be true. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligence, p. 44.] Since both (A) and (B) could be true, neither is the best answer and you have to choose between (C) and (D). Answer (D) is bad for several reasons. First, it would not be true if Hunter deliberately shot the cow (whether he thought it was a deer or not). Second, it would not be true if the National Forest was a â€œfree rangeâ€ area where cows are legally allowed to roam. And it would not be a good answer if the jurisdiction had adopted the â€œlast clear chanceâ€ doctrine, because even if Farmer was negligent, Hunter had the last clear chance to avoid shooting it. Therefore (C) is the best answer.

(390, 1, 32, '24. Pablo was an internationally famous movie star. He flew all over the world to act in movies, appear at debuts, appear on talk shows and rub elbows with the rich and famous. He booked a flight on Agony Airlines to fly to an appearance in New York City. When he arrived at the airport he found out that he had been booked to a coach seat when his agent had expressly requested a first-class seat in the first three rows.\r\n\r\nPablo was reluctant to be seen in coach because it would hurt his image to be seen with common people. And he wanted to be in the first three rows of first-class because it gave him a buzz to see the looks he got from the coach passengers as they filed down the aisle past him to their decidedly inferior locations. He called his agent and had his agent negotiate with Agony to get him a first-class seat in the first three rows. His agent told him he was only able to get him a seat in row 5. Pablo reluctantly agreed because he really needed to get to New York to push his latest film, â€œEscape from Arizonaâ€.\r\n\r\nAfter Pablo was seated the remaining passengers filed past him. One of them was Wesley Snipes, passenger 57.\r\n\r\nThere were no problems with the flight until it approached La Guardia. A mutant strain of killer geese had invaded Long Island Sound from Canada and there was a danger they might attack the planeâ€™s jet engines as they landed. For passenger safety the plane was diverted to JFK. As the plane landed an alarm went off indicating that one of the landing gear devices had malfunctioned and the plane might crash on landing. The plane circled until there was no choice but to land.\r\n\r\nThe captain told the passengers and crew about the problem and everyone was warned to assume the normal position for a crash landing. When the plane touched down the landing gear collapsed and several passengers in first-class were injured, but Snipes and the rest of the passengers in coach were not injured.\r\n\r\nAfter the crash Agony Airlines admitted flying an airplane is an abnormally dangerous activity. Then it filed for bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIf Pablo was injured, Agony admits airline travel is an abnormally dangerous activity, and there is no statutory provision governing his claim against Agony, Pablo will most likely:\r\n', '(D) The lesson to be learned here is that multiple-choice exams may present single questions based on exceedingly long fact patterns. These use up a lot of your time, yet you can only score â€œone pointâ€ if you get it right. So if you are running behind on time or even running out of time mark these long questions with a big â€œXâ€ and simply select one of the possible answers at random. You have a 25% chance of getting the answer right anyway. And there is no penalty for wrong answers. Then if you have some extra time after you have completed the rest of the exam come back to these few questions and reconsider them. The same strategy can be used when you are stumped between two possible answers for a question. Simply mark the question (e.g. if you canâ€™t decide between (A) and (B) mark it â€œA-B???â€), select one of the possible answers on the answer sheet, and move on! DO NOT WASTE TIME AGONIZING OVER A DECISION BETWEEN TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS. Here (C) is wrong because the defendant admits it was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity. That means strict liability applies, Pablo only has to prove causality and damages, and he does not have to prove â€œnegligenceâ€. (A) and (B) are wrong because they assume the airline will be liable simply because strict liability applies. (D) is correct because the only affirmative defense in a strict liability situation is assumption of the risks and one of the (obvious) risks of air travel is that the plane might crash. Pablo voluntarily assumed that risk when he got on the plane.

Barbara got drunk and fell asleep. Andy went out the back door, into Farmerâ€™s shed, started a fire and accidentally burned it down.\r\n\r\nIn an action by Farmer against the Parentis for negligence:', '(B) Answer (A) is wrong because even though Barbara is an independent contractor, the Parentis were negligent in hiring her without checking any of her references. That is called â€œnegligent contractingâ€ and it is simply a form of â€œnegligent entrustmentâ€. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligent entrustment, p. 62 and negligent contracting, p. 63.] (C) is wrong because parents are not responsible for the acts of their children. While some States may have statutes that make parents responsible for tortious acts of their minor children (e.g. California does), that is not the common law or a broadly adopted modern rule that you should apply on law school and Bar exams. (D) is wrong because there is no basis on which to find the Parentis owed Farmer a duty. They did not create â€œreasonably foreseeable perilsâ€ to anyone (except themselves and their children) by hiring Barbara. There is no evidence they knew the children had trespassed into Farmerâ€™s shed, or that it posed any danger to Farmer, even if they did. (B) is correct because the children had gone into his shed before, so there is no basis to conclude they would not have gone into the shed again even if the Parentis had not hired Barbara. That means Farmer could not prove he would not have been injured â€œbut forâ€ the parents hiring the baby-sitter. In other words, he cannot prove actual causation.

Barbara got drunk and fell asleep. Andy went out the back door, into Farmerâ€™s shed, started a fire and accidentally burned it down.\r\n\r\nIn an action by Farmer against Barbara for negligence:', '(D) Answer (A) is wrong because when Barbara assumed the duty of watching the children, she only owed that duty to the Parentis and the children. She did not owe that duty to Farmer. When duty is not based on peril the liability of defendants is generally restricted to only those plaintiffs that were owed the duty. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, the foreseeable plaintiff, p. 51.] There are exceptions to this rule such as wrongful death actions, Rescuer Doctrine, and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED).

In this case, to avoid a reduction in her damages, the businesswoman is required to do more than remain ready to work.

The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages.

The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment was probably not a material breach of contract. It represented only a small part of a large contract and can easily be remedied by an award of damages. But even if the breach was material, a court would likely employ the concept of divisibility to preclude the businesswoman from rescinding the contract of sale. As stated in Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 240, a contract is divisible where \"the performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded as agreed equivalents.\" Here, the agreed equivalents would be the sale of the business and the corresponding $25 million purchase price, and the businesswoman\'s promise to work for the company and the corresponding yearly salary of $150,000. Applying this concept, the businesswoman would be able to recover damages for the company\'s breach of its promise to employ her, but she would not be permitted to rescind the contract of sale. \r\n\r\nD is incorrect. The company\'s unjustified termination of the businesswoman\'s employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. The general rule is that employers cannot obtain specific performance requiring an employee who has breached a personal services contract to work for the employer. It is also true generally that courts refuse to grant specific performance of an employment contract against a breaching employer.

Under the UCC, a party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract.

The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery.\r\n\r\nIs the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?', 'Answer A is correct. The issue here is the interpretation of the term \"permanent employment\" in the bakery-chef contract. It is well established that \"permanent employment\" means \"employment-at-will\" in this context. In an employment-at-will relationship, either party can terminate the agreement at any time, without the termination being considered a breach (unless the termination were to violate an important public policy â€” which is not the case here). Accordingly, the chef is not liable for breach of contract.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the bakery will not prevail in a breach of contract action against the chef, but it misstates the reason why this is so. The question whether the job the baker took with the hotel was comparable to the one she left at the bakery is not relevant here. The comparability issue DOES arise in cases in which an employee who has been terminated is offered another job; in such cases the employee\'s claim for breach would be reduced by wages which could have been earned at jobs which are not different and inferior.

A promise to pay a debt after the running of the statute of limitations, like the promise in this case, is enforceable without consideration.

Unless the other party to the contract (the obligee, or the chef) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor (the decorator).

In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by consideration. Consideration is a return promise or performance which is bargained-for, i.e., sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of consideration as long as the consideration was bargained-for; it is often said that \"even a peppercorn will suffice\" for consideration.

When her son found out that the house had been sold and was not part of his mother\'s estate, he sued to have the contract avoided on behalf of the mother. \r\n\r\nOn what ground would the contract most likely be avoided?', 'Answer D is correct. A contract is voidable if the elements of undue influence--undue susceptibility to pressure and excessive pressure--are established. The undue susceptibility element can be established either by the circumstances (e.g., the mother\'s illness) or the existence of a confidential relationship (such as a parent-child relationship). The following facts support a finding of excessive pressure: the daughter\'s statement that she might not visit her mother, the daughter pressuring her mother to sell the property while her mother was in a hospice facility, the mother assenting without obtaining independent advice, and the mother\'s susceptibility to pressure.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. A contract can be avoided on the basis of duress. However, the facts fail to establish the elements of duress. Duress requires an improper threat. The daughter\'s statement that she might not visit her mother does not constitute an improper threat sufficient to support avoidance based on duress.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. If a bargained-for exchange is present, there is no additional requirement, such as an equivalency of exchange, to satisfy the consideration requirement of an enforceable contract. Moreover, the imbalance in the exchange between the mother and her daughter does not constitute the gross inadequacy of exchange that so shocks the conscience as to warrant invalidating the agreement.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect.

Therefore, the agent\'s obligation may only be discharged if the actress\'s inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the actress may cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress\'s failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit under the contract. If the actress is found not to have materially breached, then the agent\'s failure to accept her services for the remainder of the engagement would, in turn, be found to be a material breach. This answer offers the best legal theory because none of the other answers offer the actress a basis for arguing breach of contract.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect.

A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms, the promisor unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances (e.g., \"I\'ll buy it if I feel like it.\"). Such a promise is an illusory promise. The modern approach, however, is to construe a promise wherever possible so as not to be illusory. This can be done, for example, by reading into the promise an obligation to exercise discretion in good faith. So long as the promisor has limited her freedom of action in some way, the court will find consideration sufficient to enforce the return promise. When the woman promised to pay $100 \"as soon as I am able,\" she limited her freedom of action in that she will become obligated to pay the purchase price when it can be demonstrated that she has the ability to pay.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect.  A voidable promise occurs when a party to the contract has the power to disaffirm the agreement.  This occurs when there a legal reason to render the agreement unenforceable including fraud, duress and infancy.  As stated above, there is valid consideration to enforce the return promise.  Therefore, it is not a voidable promise.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because a court will construe the quoted language as limiting the woman\'s freedom of action in some way. This limitation will be sufficient consideration to enforce the return promise. C is incorrect because the seller (and not the woman) will bear the burden of demonstrating that the condition has been satisfied.', '2017-10-06 05:23:11', 1, '[\"It makes the promise voidable.\",\"It makes the promise illusory.\",\"It requires the woman to prove her inability to pay.\",\"It requires the seller to prove the woman\'s ability to pay.\"]', 3, 'Formation of Contracts'),

Under proper management, the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income, but the widower was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower, operated the farm, and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed. The nephew, who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his own, terminated his business and moved in with the widower. With the assistance of his wife, the nephew gave the widower excellent care until the widower died intestate about five years after the date of the contract.\r\n\r\nIn his final years the widower was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and arduous sort.

In criminal law any attempt to cause apprehension of a battery is an assault whether or not apprehension occurs. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, specific intent, p. 59.] (A) is the better answer and (B) and (D) are inferior because the question asks what crimes Bud can be charged with, and not what he is â€œguiltyâ€ of. Since Bud deliberately threw the ball â€œat Louâ€ and it actually hit Lou, he can be charged with both assault and battery. Whether he is found guilty of both crimes or only battery is up to the jury (finder of fact) to decide. But the evidence supports both charges being brought against Bud.

So when she acted with that intent she attempted to murder Vickie and did not attempt to murder Bob. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, specific intent, p. 59.] (D) is wrong because when Debbie attempted to shoot Vickie that was the â€œsubstantial stepâ€ the prosecution must prove to convict Vickie of attempted murder.

[See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, lesser included offenses and merger, p. 15.] Debbie could be charged with both attempted murder of Vickie and murder of Bob, but it was a single criminal act. So if she is convicted of murder for that act, she cannot also be convicted of attempted murder for the same criminal act. (C) is wrong because Debbie actually killed Bob and did not merely â€œattemptâ€ to kill him. (D) is wrong because Debbie acted with a willful and premeditated intent to kill, so her crime cannot be â€œinvoluntary manslaughterâ€, which requires an unintentional killing.

The first act of attempt to murder Vickie is a separate crime from the second attempt to murder Vickie that ended up killing Bob. Vickie could be charged with two counts of attempted murder (of Vickie) and one count of murder (of Bob). But if she were found guilty of all three charges, the second count of attempted murder (of Vickie) would merge into the count of murder (of Bob).

(723, 1, 42, '30. Don was jealous of Vic, a college soccer star. One night Don saw Vic in a bar talking to a cute coed. Donâ€™s anger got the best of him. He approached Vic, pulled out a gun and said, â€œTry playing soccer with this!â€ Then Don shot Vic in the foot with his pistol. Vic went to the hospital emergency room and died because he was allergic to the antibiotic they gave him.\r\n\r\nWith what crimes could Don be convicted?', '(B) Answer (B) is correct and (A), (C) and (D) are all wrong for the same reason â€“ there is no evidence Don intended to kill Vic. (A) and (D) are wrong because voluntary manslaughter requires intent to kill and there is no evidence Don intended to kill Vic. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, voluntary manslaughter, p. 76.] (C) is wrong for the same reason as well. One of the stupidest falsehoods ever foisted on law students is the so-called â€œDeadly Weapon Doctrineâ€. A â€œdeadly weaponâ€ is simply any object used in a manner calculated to cause a homicide. It does not have to be a gun or knife, and guns and knives are NOT â€œdeadly weaponsâ€ if they are used in a manner that is not â€œcalculated to cause deathâ€. The term â€œcalculated to cause deathâ€ means used in a manner that is intended to kill. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, intent to kill, p. 69.] (B) is correct because Donâ€™s use of the gun to shoot Vic in the foot supports a finding of â€œintent to cause great bodily injuryâ€, and it caused a death, and those two facts support either a murder conviction or a finding of involuntary manslaughter. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, intent to cause great bodily injury, p. 70.] The fact Vic died because of an allergic reaction is irrelevant because Donâ€™s act was the actual and proximate cause of Vicâ€™s death. Negligence by hospital staff, if any, is not an unforeseeable intervening cause of Vicâ€™s death because negligence by others is conclusively presumed by law to be foreseeable.

Dr. Casey, a staff physician, decided to put Abel out of his misery, so he gave him a fatal dose of morphine.

Therefore (A) and (C) are wrong because the act of Dr. Casey cut off the liability of Cain for the resulting death of Abel. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, criminal causation, p. 12.]. In addition, (A) is wrong simply because there is no such thing as â€œtransferred intentâ€ in criminal law.

The police ran to the accident scene and saw Bud and Louâ€™s guns, masks and their â€œstick-upâ€ note.\r\n\r\nBud and Lou can be charged with:', '(D) Answers (A) and (B) are wrong because Bud did not kill Granny with malice aforethought.

[See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, homicide with malice aforethought, p. 68.] The only remaining basis for finding that Bud acted with malice aforethought is application of the Felony-Murder Rule because Lou and Bud were going to commit a robbery, and that is one of the â€œinherently dangerous feloniesâ€ under that rule. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, the felony-murder rule, p. 70.] But the Felony-Murder Rule does not apply here because Grannyâ€™s death was not caused by the inherent dangers of robbery. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, death must be caused by the inherent dangers, p. 71.] (C) is wrong because there is no evidence, at all, that Bud deliberately acted to create extreme risks to Granny or anyone else.

Then Yan became the aggressor by running toward Ang with a â€œlarge knifeâ€ to defend Xian, unless that was reasonable force. That fact is not clear. Then Bao became the aggressor by shooting Yan to defend Ang, unless that was reasonable force. That fact is not clear. (A) is wrong because the facts do not show whether Bao was the aggressor or if he can claim defense of others. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, defense of others, p. 92.] (B) is wrong because the facts do not show if Bao escalated the level of violence or not. (D) is wrong because the facts do not show if Ang was still the aggressor or if Yan had become the aggressor. (C) is the best answer because in a â€œreasonable appearancesâ€ jurisdiction Bao can raise a claim of defense of others if Yan did not seem to be using reasonable force. And in a â€œstep into the shoesâ€ jurisdiction he still may be able to get the charge against him reduced from murder to involuntary manslaughter if he can show that it reasonably appeared Yan was the aggressor and that his use of force seemed necessary to defend Ang.

First, that the defendant possessed illegal drugs, and second that the defendant intentionally acted to possess them. For criminal law an â€œintentional actâ€ is exactly the same thing it is for tort law. It requires that the defendant act for the purpose of causing an illegal result. (C) and (D) are wrong because they fails to recognize the prosecution must prove Dee acted with criminal intent.

[See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, implied intent and mistake of fact, p. 10.] (B) is wrong because voluntary intoxication can be a defense to a larceny charge. Larceny is a specific intent crime. Evidence of intoxication may convince the jury the defendant did not act with intent to permanently deprive someone else of their property. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, defense of intoxication, p. 93.] (A) is wrong because the defendant must have criminal intent at the same time of the act of â€œtaking and carrying awayâ€.

Lori can be charged with:', '(C) Under common law a burglary was the trespassory breaking and entering of the dwelling of another person in the night with intent to commit a felony. Here there could be no attempted common law burglary because the defendant intended to enter a store, not a dwelling. Modernly burglary still requires proof of a trespassory entry, and if that is proven it generally supports a finding of â€œconstructive breakingâ€. A â€œtrespassory entryâ€ is an entry without consent or permission. Some States have â€œcommercial burglaryâ€ statutes that make any entry to any structure with intent to commit a felony or larceny a burglary, but that is not clearly a broadly adopted view. The Model Penal Code, for example, expressly provides the opposite â€“ entry to a building that is open to the public is not a burglary. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, entry for a criminal purpose â€“ statutory â€œcommercial burglaryâ€, p. 54.] (B) and (D) are not clearly correct because the store was open for business, and would not have been â€œtrespassoryâ€ for Lori to enter it. The common law crime of larceny is modernly codified, generally, as the crime of â€œtheftâ€, and an attempted theft is the act of taking a substantial step toward committing the crime of theft.

Then she told him to go into the store, put a bottle of her favorite whiskey in his backpack, run out of the store and meet her in the alley.\r\n\r\nIf Sonny does as Wanda tells him, what crimes has Wanda committed?', '(B) Answer (D) is wrong because a conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to pursue an illegal goal or crime, but under the common law Sonny is too young to have criminal intent. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, defense of infancy, p. 86.] Without Sonny participating in a criminal agreement there can be no â€œconspiracyâ€ at all. (A) is wrong because â€œif Sonny does as Wanda tells himâ€ there is a trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to deprive, a larceny. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, larceny, p. 29.]So the correct answer must be either (B) or (C). The distinction between them is whether or not there was a burglary. For there to be a â€œburglaryâ€ under the common law there must be an entry of a dwelling in the night. That did not happen here, so this could only be a â€œmodern law burglaryâ€. A modern law burglary still requires a â€œtrespassory entryâ€ and here the store is open for business. That means Sonny has permission to enter the store. But Wanda does NOT have permission to enter the store. So she is using Sonny as the â€œinstrumentâ€ of her criminal plan to trespassorily enter the store for her to steal the liquor, in much the same way a burglar might use a trained dog or monkey to effect a burglary. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, legal impossibility and attempt, example with Alfalfa and Spanky, p. 17.] That creates a trespassory entry for the intent of larceny, and that is a burglary under the modern law.

[See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, with intent to commit a felony, p. 56.] At common law burglary required entry with intent to commit a felony at the time of entry, and larceny was a felony at common law.

At both common law and modernly trespassory entry of an interior room or compartment large enough for a person to enter is sufficient to support a charge of burglary.

(B) is wrong because stealing a credit card number is not larceny. Larceny is a taking and carrying away of personal property of another, so it only applies to the theft of tangible things that can be â€œcarriedâ€. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, carrying away, p. 35.] A credit card number is an intangible thing.

The police arrested Tom, Dick and Harry.\r\n\r\nDick and Harry can both be charged with:', '(B) Answers (A) and (C) are wrong because Harry did not steal or attempt to steal the TV. He bought it from Dick for $150. Whether he knew Tom stole the TV is irrelevant to that fact. His purchase of the TV does not make him an â€œaccessory after the fact.â€ (B) is correct and (D) is wrong because the TV was not stolen when Harry bought it. Larceny requires a â€œtrespassory takingâ€ of personal property from another. That means the property must be taken without consent of the person who possesses it. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, trespassory taking of possession, p. 29.] Here Pablo let Dick take the TV, so there was no trespassory taking, no larceny, and the TV was not stolen goods at the time Harry received it.

Then Lou made Bud give him a share of the loot under threat that otherwise he would turn him in to the police.\r\n\r\nLou can be charged with:', '(C) Answer (A) and (B) are wrong because Lou did not help Bud rob the Brinks car, and his act of taking part of the loot afterward did not make him an â€œaccessory after the factâ€. [See â€œSimple Crimes Outlineâ€, distinction between accomplice and receiver, p. 45.] Lou did receive stolen property, but that is not an offered choice. (D) is wrong and â€œmisprision of a felonyâ€ will always be wrong on every exam. Under the very, very old common law in England this was the crime of â€œfailing to prevent or report a felonyâ€. Modernly (for several hundred years) there has been no â€œgeneral legal dutyâ€ to prevent or report crimes by others.

But on Saturday morning Victor called him and said someone had broken into his house on Friday night and stole his TV.\r\n\r\nBernie can be charged with:', '(D) Answers (A) and (B) are wrong because burglary requires a breaking â€œinâ€ or an attempt to break â€œinâ€ to the structure.

It was merely â€œplanning and preparationâ€ for committing the crimes of burglary and larceny at a later time.

After shooting he discovered he has shot Farmerâ€™s $500 cow.\r\n\r\nIf the cow had wandered into the National Forest from Farmerâ€™s farm.', '(C) The key to this question is to realize that the facts do not say whether Hunter saw Farmerâ€™s cow and thought it was a deer, or if he saw something else that he thought was a deer. Maybe he actually saw a real deer and shot the cow by accident. Conversion is an intentional interference with chattel of plaintiffs that substantially deprives the plaintiffs of the use of their property. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, conversion, p. 30.] Here if Hunter deliberately shot Farmerâ€™s cow, thinking it was a deer, it would amount to conversion and (A) would be true. But if Hunter was shooting at something else, whether it was a real deer or not, missed and hit Farmerâ€™s cow by accident it would not be an intentional tort. In that case it would be negligence and (B) would be true. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligence, p. 44.] Since both (A) and (B) could be true, neither is the best answer and you have to choose between (C) and (D). Answer (D) is bad for several reasons. First, it would not be true if Hunter deliberately shot the cow (whether he thought it was a deer or not). Second, it would not be true if the National Forest was a â€œfree rangeâ€ area where cows are legally allowed to roam. And it would not be a good answer if the jurisdiction had adopted the â€œlast clear chanceâ€ doctrine, because even if Farmer was negligent, Hunter had the last clear chance to avoid shooting it.

(A) is wrong because both actual and proximate causation must be proven.

The plastic wrap clogged up the toilet system and none of the toilets would work. The plane had to make an unscheduled stop in Bangor, Maine to unclog the toilet system, and it skidded off the icy runway, badly injuring Cheech.\r\n\r\nIf Cheech sues Chong:', '(C) Answers (A) and (B) are wrong because the accident was not caused by Chong smoking in violation of the FAA rule. Rather it was caused by him flushing the plastic wrap down the toilet after he finished smoking. If Chong had done the same thing (flushing the plastic) without ever smoking at all, Cheech still would have been injured. Therefore, Chongâ€™s breach of the FAA rule was not the actual cause of Cheechâ€™s injury. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, actual cause, p. 3.] (C) is correct because if he could not reasonably foresee his actions were putting anyone in danger he had no duty based on peril. . [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, duties created by peril, p. 49.] It could be argued that he assumed a duty to obey Agony Air rules when he bought his ticket. But even so, that would only make him liable to Agony Air, not to Cheech, under the generally accepted view. [See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, duties created by assumption, p. 49 and the foreseeable plaintiff, p. 51.] (D) is wrong because it assumes Chong had a â€œgeneral duty to act reasonablyâ€. That is wrong. He had no â€œgeneral duty to be reasonableâ€ and can only be liable if a duty was created based on peril, statute or some other legally recognized reason.

(775, 1, 38, '16. Cheech and Chong were flying to Paris on Agony Air. Before the plane left San Francisco the flight attendants announced FAA regulations prohibited smoking, including smoking in the restrooms, and that it was illegal to disable or tamper with the smoke detectors in the restrooms. Chong went into the restroom during the flight and smoked a joint (i.e. a marijuana cigarette). To keep the smoke alarm from going off he put plastic wrap over it. When he was done he flushed the joint and the plastic wrap down the toilet despite a warning sign that said â€œDo not put any foreign objects in the toiletsâ€. The plastic wrap clogged up the toilet system and none of the toilets would work. The plane had to make an unscheduled stop in Bangor, Maine to unclog the toilet system, and it skidded off the icy runway, badly injuring Cheech.\r\n\r\nSuppose that instead of flushing his joint down the toilet, Chong put it in the waste basket, it started a fire, and the plane had to make an emergency landing injuring Cheech. If Cheech sues Chong:', '(C) Answers (A), (B) and (C) are wrong because they all assume the only reason Chong could possibly be liable is because of negligence per se basis (breach of the FAA rule) while he is obviously going to also be liable because he created peril to Cheech and everyone else on the airplane. (C) is correct because putting burning materials into the waste basket on the airplane created reasonably foreseeable perils to others, and that would be true whether there was an FAA rule against it or not. [Note: A few courts have limited â€œnegligence per seâ€ to only those statutes that establish â€œcriminal penaltiesâ€, but courts vary widely on this and it does not seem to be a broadly adopted idea.

(783, 1, 38, '24. Pablo was an internationally famous movie star. He flew all over the world to act in movies, appear at debuts, appear on talk shows and rub elbows with the rich and famous. He booked a flight on Agony Airlines to fly to an appearance in New York City. When he arrived at the airport he found out that he had been booked to a coach seat when his agent had expressly requested a first-class seat in the first three rows.\r\n\r\nPablo was reluctant to be seen in coach because it would hurt his image to be seen with common people. And he wanted to be in the first three rows of first-class because it gave him a buzz to see the looks he got from the coach passengers as they filed down the aisle past him to their decidedly inferior locations. He called his agent and had his agent negotiate with Agony to get him a first-class seat in the first three rows. His agent told him he was only able to get him a seat in row 5. Pablo reluctantly agreed because he really needed to get to New York to push his latest film, â€œEscape from Arizonaâ€.\r\n\r\nAfter Pablo was seated the remaining passengers filed past him. One of them was Wesley Snipes, passenger 57.\r\n\r\nThere were no problems with the flight until it approached La Guardia. A mutant strain of killer geese had invaded Long Island Sound from Canada and there was a danger they might attack the planeâ€™s jet engines as they landed. For passenger safety the plane was diverted to JFK. As the plane landed an alarm went off indicating that one of the landing gear devices had malfunctioned and the plane might crash on landing. The plane circled until there was no choice but to land.\r\n\r\nThe captain told the passengers and crew about the problem and everyone was warned to assume the normal position for a crash landing. When the plane touched down the landing gear collapsed and several passengers in first-class were injured, but Snipes and the rest of the passengers in coach were not injured.\r\n\r\nAfter the crash Agony Airlines admitted flying an airplane is an abnormally dangerous activity. Then it filed for bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIf Pablo was injured, Agony admits airline travel is an abnormally dangerous activity, and there is no statutory provision governing his claim against Agony, Pablo will most likely:\r\n', '(D) The lesson to be learned here is that multiple-choice exams may present single questions based on exceedingly long fact patterns. These use up a lot of your time, yet you can only score â€œone pointâ€ if you get it right. So if you are running behind on time or even running out of time mark these long questions with a big â€œXâ€ and simply select one of the possible answers at random. You have a 25% chance of getting the answer right anyway. And there is no penalty for wrong answers. Then if you have some extra time after you have completed the rest of the exam come back to these few questions and reconsider them. The same strategy can be used when you are stumped between two possible answers for a question. Simply mark the question (e.g. if you canâ€™t decide between (A) and (B) mark it â€œA-B???â€), select one of the possible answers on the answer sheet, and move on!

(A) and (B) are wrong because they assume the airline will be liable simply because strict liability applies.

[See â€œSimple Torts Outlineâ€, negligent entrustment, p. 62 and negligent contracting, p. 63.] (C) is wrong because parents are not responsible for the acts of their children.

(D) is wrong because there is no basis on which to find the Parentis owed Farmer a duty.

There is no evidence they knew the children had trespassed into Farmerâ€™s shed, or that it posed any danger to Farmer, even if they did. (B) is correct because the children had gone into his shed before, so there is no basis to conclude they would not have gone into the shed again even if the Parentis had not hired Barbara.

Under common law a contract offer is a manifestation of present contractual intent, communicated to an offeree, that is sufficiently certain in terms that an objective observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, the OK rule, p. 3.] Owen may have told Paul he wanted his house painted, how much he was willing to pay, and when the work was to be done, but critical details still had to be settled. No reasonable person would believe that a contract existed until the parties talked about those details.

You were not told whether Owen got the rejection first, the acceptance first, or if he got either at all. You are not told if Owen changed position in reliance on the rejection.

Bill gutted the space and discovered a supporting pier in the center of one of the walls prevented him from implementing the plans unless he installed an engineered beam that would cost him $4,500 he had not anticipated.

Obviously if inability to pay was a legal defense we would all be using it. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, supervening impossibility, p. 27.] (B) is wrong because it is irrelevant. Bill is not claiming there was no contract to begin with because Daddy concealed or misrepresented the facts. (A) would be a good defense if the modification agreement were enforceable, but it is not. (C) is the right answer because Bill agreed to do the work for the original contract price and that gave him a pre-existing duty to do the work, and Daddyâ€™s promise to pay him $4,500 more was unsupported by any exchange of consideration. As a result, Daddyâ€™s promise to pay more is legally unenforceable. Bill could try to enforce it in equity pleading â€œdetrimental relianceâ€ or â€œpromissory estoppelâ€ but he would fail because he got Daddy to promise to pay him that extra money by threatening to breach the contract and walk away.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, accord and satisfaction, p. 56.] Therefore, (D) is clearly wrong. And the Statute of Frauds does not require a writing here, so (B) is wrong. (A) is correct because Bill had a pre- existing duty to paint the house for $4,000 and Owenâ€™s promise to pay him another $600 is not supported by consideration (something in exchange from Bill). Under the common law of contract their modification agreement is not legally enforceable for that reason. [Ignore Restatement of Contracts, 2nd which has never been broadly adopted. Instead, see â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, supporting consideration required, p. 54.] Therefore (A) is correct. (C) is wrong because it suggests Bill could recover in equity by pleading â€œpromissory estoppelâ€. But Bill made Owen promise to pay $600 more by threatening to breach the contract, and that gave him unclean hands.

The only UCC requirement is that quantity must be stated. Everything else can be imputed from past course of dealing and industry standards. But the English words â€œcanâ€ and â€œcouldâ€ only manifest ability, not â€œwillingnessâ€. The English words â€œwillâ€ and â€œwouldâ€ manifest willingness.

Ken agreed so a contract formed. But the performance of both parties is subject to the condition that Barbie must return with Bunny.

Then he abandoned the land and repudiated the contract.\r\n\r\nWill Farmer succeed in a breach of contract action against Tom?', '(C) Under the Statute of Frauds a lease of land for more than a year must be in writing to be legally enforced. So, if the agreement between Farmer and Tom was oral, it is not enforceable, and Farmer could not recover the entire amount of $7,200. But month-to-month lease agreements can always be legally enforced, and since Tom agreed to pay $300 each month and had possession for over 5 months he would owe Farmer $1,800 whether the agreement was written or not. (A) is wrong because it says Farmer will â€œonlyâ€ recover if the lease agreement was in writing, and that is not true as to the $1,800 Tom owes. (D) is wrong because making â€œvaluable improvementsâ€ is only a requirement for enforcing oral land sales contracts under the Part Performance Doctrine, not enforcing land leases. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, contracts conveying interests in land / part performance doctrine, p. 35.] (B) is wrong because Tom would have been obligated to Farmer for at least the first monthâ€™s rent even if he never took physical possession on January 1.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, legal restitution, p. 90.] Here Homer would have been obligated to pay Bill $100,000 when he completed the house. (A) is wrong because Bill has not finished the house so he has no right to be paid the full contract price. (B) is correct because if Homer pays Bill $90,000 and someone else $10,000 to complete the house his total expenditures would be $100,000, the amount that he was obligated to pay under the contract. That way he is not reaping a benefit from breaching the contract. (C) is wrong because if Homer pays Bill $100,000 and someone else $10,000 his total expenditures would exceed the amount he was obligated to pay under the contract.

(A) is correct because if Fries â€œreasonably expected to be paidâ€ a Court of equity could grant Fries a judgment based on implied-in-law contract theory.

Finally, (C) is wrong because Paulâ€™s notice to Thomas on 2/26 that he could not get the paint on time is clearly an anticipatory repudiation, a major breach.

That is what makes them â€œexpressâ€ rather than â€œimpliedâ€. It is simply nonsense to say, â€œThe express conditions implied that...â€ Implied conditions are simply implied by the purposes of the parties and the circumstances within which the contract forms, not the express provisions of the agreement. (B) is correct. The term â€œconstructive conditionâ€ means a condition that is implied by the circumstances of the contract. Usually it means the circumstances imply one party has a duty to perform in some manner before the other party is bound, but it can also mean the circumstances imply some â€œorder of performanceâ€ is necessary to bind a party. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, constructive conditions, p. 46.] Here the circumstances show the parties did not intend for Ann to be bound until after she was licensed to practice law.

On Wednesday Sid sold his horse to Charley for $19,000 and did not tell Bob. Charley had no idea Bobâ€™s option on the horse existed. On Thursday Bob called Sid and said he could not pay more than $10,000 for the horse.

That means that Sid could not say or do anything to revoke the offer for that time period, and that includes selling the horse, so (A) is wrong. Nothing Sid does can terminate Bobâ€™s option under Restatement Second Â§ 37, the only clear law on this, so (B) is wrong. Bobâ€™s discovery of what Sid has done also cannot terminate his option, so (C) is wrong. And the only possible answer left is (D). His option continued in effect to Monday because he paid for that.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, distinguishing express conditions from covenants, p. 43.] (A) is wrong because the term â€œSatisfaction Guaranteed!â€ does not make â€œpersonal satisfactionâ€ an express material condition of the contract because neither that term nor the circumstances of the contract suggest that Bill ever intended to go unpaid if Homer was dissatisfied.

(B) is wrong because even if the brakes were not faulty the accord and satisfaction is binding as long as Rambo reasonably thought they were faulty. (C) is wrong because the accord and satisfaction would not be binding if Rambo did not reasonably believe the brakes were faulty.

Since Bill breached that promise Owenâ€™s promise to pay did not ripen into a duty to pay.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, distinguishing express conditions from covenants, p. 43.] (C) is wrong because the contract here required modifications to be in writing, and here the oral modification would not be an effective modification.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, waivers of condition, p. 56 and promissory estoppel, p. 96.] (D) is wrong because this is at the discretion of the court, and there is no such thing as â€œlegal estoppelâ€. Estoppel is always an equitable concept. (A) is wrong because if Owen retracts his waiver Bill would be in major breach because use of Standard Brands paint was an express contract condition.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, unclean hands, p. 100.] (B) is the best answer because even though Bill has unclean hands a court of equity would probably order Owen to pay him something less than the contract amount, and that offset would probably be the amount Owen saved, if any, by substituting a cheaper brand of paint.', '2017-10-14 00:02:20', 1, '[\"Owen owes Bill $200,000.\",\"Owen owes Bill less than $200,000 if Kelly-Moore paint is cheaper or of lower quality than Standard Brands.\",\"Owen is in breach because he agreed Bill could use a different paint.\",\"Owen is legally estopped from objecting to the brand of paint.\"]', 1, 'Unclean hands, p. 100.'),

If both Wayne and City know Garth is an intended beneficiary of the assignment, it becomes a third-party beneficiary contract.

But assignments in exchange for consideration are irrevocable. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, revocation of gratuitous assignments, p. 64.] When irrevocable assignments conflict, the first in time prevails.

She gave up a lease she held on another office and worked for days with Interior Design on the plans for her exciting new office. Bill discovered a supporting pier in the center of one of the walls prevented him from implementing Interior Designâ€™s plans unless he installed an engineered beam that would cost him $4,500. Bill and Daddy decided to substantially change the plans so the supporting pier did not have to be removed.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, third-party beneficiary contracts, p. 58.] (B) is wrong because Nancy is an intended beneficiary, not an incidental beneficiary. When Daddy and Bill agreed to modify the construction it was effectively a modification of their contract so that Bill would do the work differently and in exchange Daddy would waive his rights to demand that the construction do as originally promised. (D) is wrong because that is an exchange of consideration. Nancy is a donee beneficiary, and donee beneficiaries have no legal rights to enforce third-party beneficiary contracts against promisees (Daddy is the promisee of Bill here). Donee beneficiaries can legally enforce contracts against breaching promisors (Bill here). But Bill performed the contract as it had been modified, so he was not in breach. Therefore (C) is wrong as Nancy has no legal cause of action against either Daddy or Bill.

You simply have to eliminate the worst answers, try to narrow your choices down to two possible answers and pick one of them. Here the question asks if Cliff was a third-party beneficiary of Ronâ€™s â€œworkâ€. That must mean â€œcontract with Anneâ€ because the only â€œworkâ€ Ron did that concerned Cliff was under that contract. (A) is wrong because Cliffâ€™s rights under the Anne-Ron agreement do not depend on the Anne-Cliff agreement referred to. And even if the writer of the question meant to say â€œunder the agreement between Anne and Ronâ€ this would still be a wrong answer. (B) is wrong because Cliff could not be a â€œthird-party beneficiaryâ€ of the Anne-Cliff agreement because he is a party to that same contract. (C) is wrong because it does not respond to the CALL. (D) is wrong because Cliff is a third- party beneficiary of the Anne-Ron contract. So all 4 answers are wrong and are going to have to guess which of them was supposed to be the â€œrightâ€ answer before someone at the Bar screwed it up.

(A) is wrong because it suggests Harry might claim he entered into the Tom-Harry contract as a result of a â€œunilateral mistakeâ€ that Tom knew or should have known of. But a claim of â€œunilateral mistakeâ€ is not allowed as a defense when the partiesâ€™ â€œmistakeâ€ is simply about what the properties bought or sold are worth.

But claims that items for sale are â€œgreatâ€, â€œdependableâ€, â€œreliableâ€, etc. are merely â€œpufferyâ€ and not misrepresentation of material facts. (C) is correct because Dick could claim Tom is trying to enforce an illegal contract, and illegal contracts are void ab initio as a matter of law. Therefore Harry can raise the same defense.

Under that modification some unspecified motorcycle dealer was going to benefit, so that unnamed dealer was an intended third-party beneficiary. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, third-party beneficiary contracts, p. 58.] Butch ended up being that dealer, and this illustrates why the â€œintended third-party beneficiaryâ€ never has to be identified by name or even known with certainty when a third-party beneficiary contract forms.

First, Owen is promising Carl he will pay Carlâ€™s debt, not promising Butch that he will pay Carlâ€™s debt.

They agreed escrow would close on September 1. On August 1 Tom called Dick and told him he was having some trouble qualifying for the loan. Dick offered to carry a second (to loan Tom part of the price as a subordinated claim against the property) for $30,000 at 7%. Tom agreed to that and succeeded in getting a loan for $290,000 at 5.5%. On September 1 Tom tendered payment of $370,000. Dick refused to accept the money. The next year Dick entered into a contract to sell Blackacre to Harry.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following is the most accurate statement?', '(B) The equitable defense of laches can be raised against both equitable and legal actions when the party seeking a remedy (the movant) has unreasonably delayed seeking a remedy, and as a result the defending party (the respondent) would suffer unjust prejudice or result. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, laches, p. 100.] (A) is wrong because even though Tom may have been able to have a Court equitably estop Dick from refusing to accept his payment on September 1, Tom took no action at that time. (B) is correct because Tom did not act to seek a remedy against Dick within a reasonable period of time, and for Tom to block the sale to Harry the â€œnext yearâ€ would unjustly prejudice Dickâ€™s position. (C) is correct but it is not the best answer because even though Tom could plea for promissory estoppel, Dick would counter that plea with the defense of laches. (D) is wrong because the oral agreement between Tom and Dick, that Dick would accept less than $400,000, was not in writing, and this was a contract for the sale of land. As a result, the agreement (a modification of their contract) was not legally enforceable, and could only be considered a â€œwaiver of conditionâ€. And waivers of conditions are always revocable at law. So when Dick refused to accept $370,000, he was merely revoking his waiver of the contract condition that Tom could pay $370,000 instead.

Breaching a contract is illegal (that is why the law provides a remedy), and threatening to breach a contract is just as illegal. (B) is wrong because Bill did not raise a â€œgood faith, reasonable contract dispute.â€ (C) is the best answer because Bill cannot win at law in a breach of contract action since the modification was not supported by consideration. Therefore, he can only plead in equity, and he cannot obtain a remedy in equity because he has unclean hands.

Mowenâ€™s mower broke down and he was not able to finish mowing until Saturday.\r\n\r\nIf Farmer has suffered no damages as a result of the delay but refuses to pay Mowen anyway:', '(C) Answer (A) is wrong because Farmerâ€™s promise to pay was subject to the constructive condition precedent that Mowen had to perform as promised. Mowen did not perform as promised because he was late finishing the job. As a result Mowen was in breach, and Farmerâ€™s promise did not become a duty to pay. Therefore, it is logically impossible for Farmer to be in breach, whether major or minor until and unless it is determined Mowen substantially performed. If he did, the constructive condition would be excused, and Farmerâ€™s promise to pay would ripen into a duty to pay. But that is a fact for the Court to decide, and until it is decided, Farmer cannot be in breach. (B) is wrong because Mowen is the breaching party and as such cannot have suffered any â€œdamagesâ€. (C) is correct because the only possible remedy that can be awarded to a breaching party is restitution. If the breach was minor, the award of a money judgment is legal restitution. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, restitution to breaching party, p. 91.] If a money judgment is awarded to a party that has committed a major breach or for some other reason has no right to a remedy at law, the remedy is equitable restitution.

As a result, when Coats breached the contract, it was a major breach, and he no longer has any legal right to be paid at all.

Dick accepted Tomâ€™s $200,000 bid first, and then Harry accepted Tomâ€™s $300,000 bid. Tom had to decline Harryâ€™s job, so Harry engaged the services of a different contractor. Tom spent $150,000 on labor and materials building Dickâ€™s house. Then Dick repudiated the contract and ordered Tom off his land.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, damages, p. 85.] Here Tom had expectation damages of $20,000, reliance damages of $150,000, and incidental damages of $1,000. The fact that Tom did not make the profit he â€œexpectedâ€ from entering into a contract with Harry was not caused by Dickâ€™s later breach, so it did not constitute either reliance or consequential damages. As a result, Tomâ€™s total damages caused by the breach were $171,000. But Tom has a right to an award measured by legal restitution, the amount of benefit his efforts conveyed upon Dick. Since the contract amount was $200,000 and Dick only had to spend $25,000 more to complete the house, Tom has conveyed $175,000 in benefits on Dick. (A) is wrong because even though Tomâ€™s damages were $171,000, he has a right to be paid $175,000 in legal restitution.

But the CALL here asks about Tammyâ€™s â€œrightsâ€, and that concerns the remedies she would have at law, not in equity. The contract here cannot be performed within a year from the date of execution because it was created in May, and Tammy was to perform contract duties until the end of May of the next year. So it is not legally enforceable for the entire period specified. But that does not mean it is void entirely. It would not be unenforceable for the period that Tammy has already performed.

Bob asserts that Pacific breached the lease because it had promised to return the land to the â€œoriginal conditionâ€ as it was in 2000.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, resolving contradicting provisions, p. 42.] (D) is wrong because interpretation disputes are not â€œmutual mistakesâ€ that would void all contracts. If it were so, every contract could be voided after the fact by simply disputing the meanings of the words used.

It allows a Court to legally enforce an oral agreement for the sale of land in certain circumstances even though the Statute of Frauds has not been satisfied, if the buyer has taken exclusive possession of the land, paid all or almost all of the purchase price or otherwise has made valuable improvements, and the acts of the parties can only be explained by the conclusion that the land was sold under an oral agreement. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, contracts conveying interests in land / part performance doctrine, p. 35.] (A) and (B) are wrong because Jose took exclusive possession, paid the entire sale price, and a mere â€œrenterâ€ would not have paid White $40,000 at the beginning of the transaction. Under these circumstances the Part Performance Doctrine, at least in some States, would give Jose a legal right to the land, and he would not have to depend on an equitable argument. (D) is wrong for the same reason. Detrimental reliance is an equitable argument and the Part Performance Doctrine, at least when adopted by statute, provides legal rights.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, waiver of major breach, p. 78.] Consequently, if the performing parties otherwise are found to have substantially performed, constructive conditions will be excused and the non-breaching parties promise to pay for performance will ripen into a duty to pay, with an offset for damages caused by the breaches of the performing parties. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, restitution to breaching party, p. 91.] (B) and (C) are wrong because Sam allowed Max to continue performance after discovering he had violated an express condition of the contract. That â€œwaived the breachâ€ and left Max with a legal right to be paid. (D) is wrong because Samâ€™s promise to pay Max was subject to the constructive condition that Max had to perform as promised. He did not, and because of that breach Samâ€™s promise to pay him never ripened into a duty to pay. Consequently, it was logically impossible for Sam to breach the contract at all. (A) is correct because Max would be held to have substantially performed, and that will excuse the constructive conditions leaving Sam with a duty to pay him the contract price less any damages caused by the breach.

That means that if the offeree says, â€œOk!â€ an observer would believe that both parties are legally bound to a clear and complete agreement. [See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, the OK rule, p. 3.] Under the UCC there are â€œgap fillersâ€ that will allow a Court to impute many missing terms based on past dealings between the parties and standards in the trade.

[See â€œSimple Contracts & UCC Outlineâ€, reasonable certainty of terms, p. 2.] So ask yourself, if Bob had sent Sam a fax on 2/6 saying â€œOk!â€ what would Sam have thought it meant? (A) is wrong because Samâ€™s initial message did not say how many chokes he was offering to sell to Bob. In fact he asked Bob to tell him how many chokes he wanted to order.

The terms of a contract for the sale of goods are established upon acceptance of an offer. Under Uniform Commercial Code Â§ 2-206, an offer to buy goods for prompt shipment is accepted when the seller ships the goods. Because the bottling company\'s acceptance (shipment of the bottles) occurred PRIOR to the receipt of the acknowledgment form, the acknowledgement form was an ineffective attempt to modify the parties\' contract.

This answer correctly concludes that the bottling company will recover consequential damages, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. While disclaimers of consequential damages might sometimes be found unconscionable, the mere existence of such a disclaimer is not enough to establish unconscionability, and there is no evidence in this case that would otherwise suggest that the contract was unconscionable.

The effect of the mistake was material to the value of the exchange in this case, as it reduced the boar\'s value from $800 to $100.

The fugitive testified and was released. The authorities refused to pay the reward to the private detective on the ground that the fugitive was never convicted.\r\n\r\nWould the private detective be likely to prevail in a breach of contract action against the authorities?', 'Answer D is correct. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the condition occurs or its nonoccurrence is excused.

The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: \"I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.\" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.\r\n\r\nThe son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries.\r\n\r\nWhich of the following provides most significant information in determining whether or not there was bargained-for consideration to support the father\'s promise to the physician?', 'Answer C is correct. When a preexisting duty was owed to a third party, courts may hold that a new promise to do the same action is not sufficient as consideration. If the father had a contract with the woman to pay for all losses, then he had a preexisting duty to pay the physician. Therefore, the father\'s subsequent promise to the physician to pay the bill may not constitute consideration as he was already obligated to pay under his contract with the woman. Thus, the father\'s promise to pay was not bargained-for in exchange for the physician\'s promise to treat the woman. Both the timing of the father\'s call and the existence of a contract between the woman and the father are significant in determining whether there was bargained-for consideration to support the father\'s promise to pay the physician. If an action was already performed before the promise was made, it will not qualify as consideration because it was not \"bargained-for.\" Therefore, if the father\'s promise to pay the physician was made after the physician began treating the woman, then the physician\'s treatment of the woman will not constitute consideration.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. The sole fact that the physician had not started treating the woman before the father called him is not enough information to determine if there was bargained-for consideration.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect. We do not know if the physician had begun treating the woman before or after the father\'s promise to pay. As stated above, the timing is significant in determining whether there was bargained-for consideration to support the father\'s promise to pay the physician. Therefore, the fact that there was a contract between the father and the woman is not enough information.\r\n\r\nD is incorrect. The sonâ€™s death does not impact the agreement made between the father and the physician. The timing of any promise made between the father and the woman compared with any promise made between the father and the physician is what is at issue.

(973, 1, 22, 'A borrower asked a lender to lend her $1,000. The lender replied that he would do so only if the borrower\'s father would guarantee the loan.

The father died on September 16.

A unilateral contract is a contract created by an offer that can only be accepted by performance. Here, the father\'s letter could only be accepted by the lender lending $1,000 to the borrower. Generally the offeree is not required to give the offeror notice that he has begun the requested performance, but is required to notify the offeror within a reasonable time after performance has been completed. Therefore, when the lender made the loan to the borrower on the 15th, the contract was effectively accepted even if the father had not yet been notified. Thus, the father\'s death on the 16th does nothing to render the promise made in his letter to the lender ineffective.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect. In order to constitute consideration (i) there must be a bargained-for-exchange between the parties; and (ii) there must be a benefit to the promisor or detriment to the promisee. Here, the father wanted the lender to lend the $1,000 to his daughter. The loan was to his benefit. Therefore, there was consideration.\r\n\r\nB is incorrect because the father died on September 16th. The lender accepted the father\'s offer on September 15th, when he lent $1,000 to the borrower.\r\n\r\nC is incorrect.

The offeree must give notice within a reasonable time after performance has begun. Here, the lender mailed a letter on September 16th, the day after he had lent the $1,000 to the borrower.

The only provision in the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company relating to the outlet\'s contract with the bank stated that the outlet \"hereby assigns all of its computer service contracts to [the computer service company].\" \r\n\r\nThe computer service company performed the monthly maintenance required under the service contract. Its performance was defective, however, and caused damage to the bank\'s operations. \r\n\r\nWhom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company\'s defective performance?', 'Answer B is correct. The retail outlet effectively delegated to the computer service company the outlet\'s duty of performance owed to the bank. However, absent consent by the obligee (the bank) or performance by the delegatee (the computer service company), an effective delegation does not relieve the delegating party (the retail outlet) of its duty to the obligee. When the computer service company purchased the service contracts, the bank also became an intended beneficiary of the computer service company\'s promise to the retail outlet. The computer service company expressly agreed with the retail outlet to perform the outlet\'s obligation to the bank, making the bank an intended beneficiary of that obligation. Thus, both the retail outlet and the computer service company remain liable to the bank.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. The computer service company expressly agreed with the retail outlet to perform the outlet\'s obligation to the bank, thus imposing a duty on the computer service company of which the bank was an intended beneficiary. Therefore, the bank is also entitled to sue the computer service company for its defective performance.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. Assuming an effective assignment, the right of the retail outlet to the bank\'s performance was extinguished.

Normally, promises made in recognition of a past benefit conferred (such as the girl\'s promise to pay the seller $75) are not enforceable because any benefit received by the girl was not bargained-for (the telescope was not given in exchange for the $75). As an exception to the rule, courts will enforce such a promise if the promise reaffirms a promise made pursuant to an earlier bargained-for exchange that was not enforceable at the time because of infancy. Although the girl\'s earlier promise to pay $100 for the telescope was not enforceable because the girl lacked capacity to contract, her later promise to pay $75 for the telescope is enforceable: first, because the girl no longer lacks capacity to contract; and second, because her subsequent promise falls within the exception to the rule and is enforceable notwithstanding the lack of consideration.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because the issue is not the enforceability of the original contract, but rather that of the subsequent promise.

Under the UCC, any trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity in a place, vocation, or trade so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can be introduced to interpret the parties\' agreement, so long as the usage can be reasonably construed as being consistent with the express terms of the contract. Indeed, the UCC defines \"agreement\" as including the parties\' express terms as well as those that are implied by applicable trade usage. Although the written contract between the computer company and the bank called for delivery \"on or before July 31,\" the trade usage that the computer company seeks to introduce suggests that buyers should allow for up to 30-days\' leeway beyond that date. If the contract were construed in light of this usage, then the August 15 delivery would not be a breach of the contract and the bank would be in breach for refusing to take delivery on that date. The fact that buyers and sellers typically negate the usage with express language if the delivery date is to be construed strictly suggests that the trade usage is fairly persuasive evidence of the parties\' intent.\r\n\r\nA is incorrect because even an immaterial delay in delivery would entitle the bank to reject delivery of the computer. B is incorrect because such an inference would not be reasonable if the contract is literally construed as requiring delivery \"on or before July 31.\" C is incorrect because a truckers\' strike would not justify excuse on grounds of impracticability, because the facts do not suggest that the availability of ground shipment is a basic assumption on which the contract was made.', '2017-10-16 07:07:11', 1, '[\"The delay did not materially harm the bank.\",\"The computer company believed, on the assumption that the bank was getting a \\\"super deal\\\" for its money, that the bank would not reject because of the late tender of delivery.\",\"The computer company\'s delay in tender was caused by a truckers\' strike.\",\"A usage in the relevant trade allows computer sellers a 30-day leeway in a specified time of delivery, unless the usage is expressly negated by the contract.\"]', 3, 'Contract Content and Meaning'),

(C) is wrong because Yamahaâ€™s 10/1 offer lapsed on 10/15 pursuant to the terms of the offer. The use of a fax to transmit an offer implies a need for promptness, and a statement as to the date acceptance should be made by clearly establishes the â€œreasonable period of timeâ€ in which the offer must be accepted.

Tom told Dick that Harryâ€™s Art Gallery was offering an oil painting called â€œThree Sistersâ€ by Goldberg for $3,000 which was worth far more because Goldberg had recently died in very scandalous circumstances in a convent.

In response to an action by Dick, Harry denies they had an enforceable contract.\r\n\r\nDid Dickâ€™s telegram satisfy the Statute of Frauds?', ' (C) This is a deliberately garbled question to teach you how to deal with these situations when they confront you. If someone tells you that the Statute of Frauds requires contracts for the sale of goods over $500 to be in writing, or that the mnemonic for the Statute of Frauds is â€œMY LEGSâ€ with â€œGâ€ or â€œSâ€ standing for â€œsales of goodsâ€, you are dealing with a person who does not really understand the current state of contract law. Contracts for the sale of goods have been governed by UCC 2-201 and not by the â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ under the broadly adopted law in the United States since the last century (Louisiana is the only State that has not adopted UCC Article 2). People who say â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ to mean â€œthe need for a writingâ€ merely cause confusion. So when the CALL of the question asks if the telegram satisfies â€œthe Statute of Fraudsâ€ you have to ask yourself, â€œDo they mean UCC 2-201?â€ Consider the question writer might be saying â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ to mean â€œneed for a writingâ€. If ALL the possible answers are wrong otherwise, you must assume the writer of the question was blind to the fact they wrote a UCC question or else expects you to apply UCC 2-201 as if that were â€œthe Statute of Fraudsâ€. Here, if you assume the term â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ is used to mean â€œneed for a writing as set forth in UCC 2-201â€, that UCC section requires â€œsufficient writingsâ€ to prove a contract formed and it must be signed by the party to be bound UNLESS the contract was for â€œspecial made goodsâ€, or its existence is legally admitted by the party to be bound (in pleadings - an answer to a complaint or a motion or in court or deposition testimony), or to the extent goods or payment for them is accepted, or between merchants when there is a â€œsales confirmationâ€ stating quantity. Here Harry accepted $3,000 in cash, so he is bound to a contract for that amount, $3,000, under UCC 2-201. That $3,000 was the price of the painting he wanted to buy anyway, so no writing is needed. That makes (C) the correct answer and (A), (B) and (D) all wrong answers. (D) is also wrong because the paintings were not â€œspecial madeâ€ by Goldberg to specifications provided by Dick. Even if they had been that still would be a wrong answer because then no writing would be needed either.

If you assume the question writer means the phrase â€œStatute of Fraudsâ€ to mean â€œthe need for a writingâ€ as set forth in the Statute of Frauds before UCC 2- 201 was adopted only (D) is remotely correct. (A) and (B) are not correct because the telegram is in writing and it clearly shows an offer was made by Dick, but that alone does not provide written proof Harry accepted that offer. (C) is wrong because mistakes by Harry do not eliminate the old Statute of Frauds requirement of sufficient writings to prove there was a contract. (D) becomes the only plausible answer because if UCC 2-201 did not exist, the shipment by Harry would not create the exception to the rule that exists today and Harry would not be bound to a contract under the old Statute of Frauds unless he somehow â€œsigned the telegramâ€ to create a written acceptance which turned the telegram into a written contract signed by both parties.

(5, 1, 'Bhagavad Gita', 'To properly illustrate the consistency in the conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa has quoted the first 27 verses in chapter one beginning dharma-ksetra kuru- ksetra refering to Kuruksetra as the land of righteousness.\r\n\r\nNow when King Dhritarastra learned that Lord Krishna had accepted the position of chariot driver for Arjuna, he immediately was suspicious and became doubtful of his son, Duryodhana\'s chances for victory. At that time he asked his minister Sanjaya a redundant question as what did his sons and the son of his brother do in the first verse of chapter one.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood in the correct context that the revelatory instructions given by Lord Krishna to Arjuna in the 700 verses of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita that is revealed within Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa\'s monumental, historical epic, Mahabharata; as to what was being told by Sanjaya to Dhritarastra is actually a conversation described to Arjunas great, grandson, Emperor Janamejaya by Vaisampayana Muni and it is he who is expressing the words dhritarastra uvaca meaning Dhritarastra said.\r\n\r\nSrimad Bhagavad-Gita begins with Dhritarastra asking Sanjaya: What did my sons and the sons of Pandu, assembled at the righteous land of Kuruksetra desirious of battle do? Now the question which arises, is what was the necessity of Dhritarastra asking Sanjaya what did they do; when he himself in the same verse says: they are assembled desirous of battle. The reason he is asking is because Kuruksetra is the land of righteousness.\r\n\r\nDhritarastra was thinking: Kuruksetra is famous as the land of sacrifice for the demigods and also the abode of brahma-jnana, knowledge of the Ultimate Truth for all living entities. He was worried that under the potent influence of Kuruksetra\'s righteous land, his sons would have decided to return half of the kingdom back unto the sons of Pandu now being free from all jealously? Or is it that the sons of Pandu fearing that the destruction of a dynasty is an unrighteous act in a holy place like Kuruksetra and have decided that it\'s best to retire to the forest and live as renunciates for the rest of their lives?\r\n\r\nBy addressing Sanjaya, Dhritarastra means that by the mercy of Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa, Sanjaya has become free from attachment and aversion and thus he will certainly speak the truth. By using the word mamakah and pandavah in referring to his sons and the sons of Pandu indicates disparity and shows that Dhritarastra did not accept the sons of his deceased brother Pandu as he did his own sons and this reveals his enmity towards them.\r\n\r\nKsetra also means field of cultivation. Just as in a rice field there are unwanted grasses looking exactly like the rice paddy which must be uprooted. Similarly the use of the word dharma-ksetra is indicative that the unrighteous sons of Dhritarastra will also be uprooted.', '2017-09-14 06:04:34', 1, 'public', 'https://www.bhagavad-gita.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/gita-01.jpg', NULL),
