Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is the\r\nfailure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same\r\ncircumstances. To establish a prima facie case Paula must generally prove DUTY, BREACH,\r\nACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSATION and DAMAGES.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">1) DUTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Generally a person owes no duty to others.

But she was not in the CLASS OF PEOPLE the statute was intended to protect\r\nbecause it was to protect people â€œon national landsâ€ and she was â€œoutside the National Forest\r\nboundariesâ€. Further, she did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent\r\nbecause it was to â€œprevent forest fires and injuryâ€ while her injury was getting wet and having her\r\nmoney stolen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Paula would be unable to prove Tom was negligent per se.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">DUTY BASED ON PERIL?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the zone of danger\r\ncaused by the defendant\'s acts.

And once there he threw the firecrackers â€œcarefullyâ€.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Paula could only argue that a reasonably observant person would have seen the â€œlogâ€ floating\r\ndown the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any\r\nmore careful than Tom.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">3) ACTUAL CAUSE of injury to Paula?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law an act ACTUALLY CAUSES injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured but\r\nfor the act.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if Tom had not thrown the\r\nfirecracker.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom was the actual cause of Paula\'s injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">4) PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury to Paula?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable, close\r\nin time and place to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a chain of causation unbroken\r\nby unforeseeable intervening events.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Generally when there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the last, unforeseeable,\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">intentional act will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole\r\nproximate cause, cutting off all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and\r\nintentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent additional specific facts.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula was rather far away from Tom in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she\r\ncould be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further a reasonable person could not foresee\r\nthat a firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if Tom was the proximate cause\r\nof Paula falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because\r\nHarryâ€™s criminal act was an unforeseeable intervening event.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;TimesNewRoman,Italic&quot;; font-size: 12pt;\">Therefore, Paula probably could not prove Tom was the proximate cause of her fall into the river,\r\nand she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</span></p><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 74\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">5) DAMAGES?\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and\r\nsuffering).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula had SPECIAL damages because she lost \"two dollars\" and she had GENERAL\r\ndamages because she was \"hurt and upset.\" But she got out of the river â€œlaughinglyâ€ and was not\r\nâ€œhurt and upsetâ€ until after she discovered the purse was stolen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore Paula suffered actual damages, but Tom was not the cause of those damages.\r\n6) CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was\r\nresponsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY\r\napproach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiffâ€™s recovery based on\r\nthe degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own\r\ninjuries is completely barred from recovery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">NEGLIGENCE PER SE is defined above. Tom might argue Paula was NEGLIGENT PER SE\r\nbecause she was fishing on the bridge where that is prohibited by statute. But Paula did not suffer\r\nthe TYPE OF INJURY the statute was to prevent/ The purpose of the statute was â€œtraffic safetyâ€\r\nand she was not injured in a traffic accident.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore any â€œnegligence per seâ€ argument by Tom would fail.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Tomâ€™s better argument is that Paula was contributorily (comparatively) negligent because she sat\r\nâ€œcarelesslyâ€ and that placed her in PERIL of falling.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom could easily prove Paula was â€œcarelessâ€ and partly responsible for her own\r\ninjury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">7) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?<br>\r\nUnder tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete defense when plaintiffs 1) put\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">themselves at risk, 2) with a full awareness of the risks, and 3) a conscious acceptance of the risks.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula put herself at risk because she â€œsat carelesslyâ€. She had a full awareness of the risks\r\nthat she could fall. And she appears to have consciously accepted those risks because the river\r\nwas only a few â€œfeetâ€ below her, â€œshe could swimâ€ and it was a â€œnice dayâ€.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore Tom may be able to prove assumption of the risks.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n		\r\n	\r\n	\r\n		<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 75\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">PAULA V.

The County would argue that the\r\nnoise was insufficient interference to prevent Ken from enjoying his land because Ken \"didn\'t\r\nthink the noise was so bad\" when he bought the house. He in effect CAME TO THE NUISANCE,\r\nand that fact suggests the situation was not as bad as Ken claims.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">But Ken would try to prove that the interference was unreasonable because the County let flights\r\nincrease â€œten percent\" in only \"four years.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">The County would also argue it did not cause the nuisance, and had not acted irresponsibly. The\r\nCounty might argue it was not responsible because the increase in noise was caused by \"military\r\nuse\" beyond their control. Alternatively, the County would argue that it acted reasonably because\r\nthe flights were in response to the \"Romaria crisis.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Ken would argue he suffered damages because the value of his home was less that it otherwise\r\nwould be. But the County would argue there was no proof of financial loss because the home had\r\ngone up in value and the claim of loss was speculative. Further, the County would argue there was\r\nno proof the birds did not sing as much as before.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, the County might be liable for private nuisance depending on whether Ken could prove\r\nthese legal elements.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">2) PUBLIC NUISANCE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law PUBLIC NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff\'s use and\r\nenjoyment of public resources causing her particular injury that is different or greater than the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here the noise interferes with the enjoyment of public land because it prevents Ken from \"hearing\r\nthe birds sing\" on the \"public river parkway.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">The County may argue that Ken lacks standing because he does not suffer any injury that is\r\ndifferent from any other member of the public.

If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive\r\nrelief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy,\r\nand the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the\r\ninterests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive\r\nrelief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property\r\nvalue caused by the nuisance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here the nuisance is a permanent condition, so the Court would consider injunctive relief. But the\r\ninterest of third parties, people who use the airport, the military, and the County residents would\r\nbe so significant the Court is unlikely to issue an injunction stopping the airport from continuing\r\noperations.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore the Court would most likely award Ken money damages to reflect the loss of market\r\nvalue of his property caused by the increase in airport traffic.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman\'\">[</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Bold\'\">ANSWER EXPLANATION: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman\'\">This question is roughly based on true events.

Sam counterclaimed against Windco for damages resulting from the delayed installation and unmerchantable quality of the windows.</p><p>How should the court rule on Windcoâ€™s and Samâ€™s actions? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>Answer A to Question 1</p><p>1. Windco v. Sam â€“ Full Price</p><p>Windco is suing on the contract (K) and must first show that all enforceable K was formed, i.e., mutual assent, consideration &amp; no defenses to K formation.</p><p>A. Mutual assent. 1. Offer.</p><p>a. Advertisement. An advertisement is generally not an offer absent an identified group of offerees to which the ad is communicated, quantity &amp; subject matter. Here, the ad is likely not the offer.</p><p>2. Samâ€™s writing. An offer is a manifestation of present interest to be bound to sufficiently definite essential terms. Samâ€™s writing contained quantity (30), subject matter (window frames), price ($100 each) and his identity. His note to have installation within 15 days manifested his intent to be bound. This was an offer.</p><p>2. Acceptance.</p><p>a. Governing law. Acceptance and terms included turn on governing law. Here 85%, or the main purpose of the K, involved the sale of goods. Goods are moveable personal property; here, window frames. Sale of goods are governed by UCC.</p><p>b. Acknowledgment of Order. An acceptance is a manifestation by the offeror of present intent to be bound to the terms of the offer. Here, Windco sent an acknowledgment of order. Typically, an acknowledgment of receipt of order is not sufficient manifestation to be bound, so this was not necessarily an acceptance. However, UCC permits acceptance by any reasonable means.</p><p>c. Installing. Therefore, the fact that Windco performed and installed the frames will be Windcoâ€™s acceptance, because acceptance can be made by conduct.</p><p>3. Terms.</p><p>a. Merchants. A merchant is one who deals in the course of business with goods of the kind or holds himself out as having special skills in the area. Here, Windco was in the business of</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-2-</p><p><br></p><p>window frames, i.e., a merchant, and Sam was a commercial builder. Sam was a merchant, because he regularly dealt with and had skills in the area of windows. UCCâ€™s merchant-to- merchant rules will apply.</p><p>b. New terms between merchants. Between merchants, new and additional terms are included in the agreement unless: the offer was expressly conditional upon the offerorâ€™s terms, or acceptance was limited to the terms of the acceptance or the offeree objects to the new terms within 10 days.</p><p>(i) Samâ€™s written note - Time for performance.</p><p>Here, Sam will argu e that his â€œmust have guarantee - - - within 15 days...â€ was a term on which his offer was expressly conditioned, and that therefore Windcoâ€™s change to â€œwithin 60 daysâ€ is not included. However, Windco will argue that Samâ€™s wording did not say: â€œexpressly conditional uponâ€ or â€œoffer limited to . . .â€ &amp; that Samâ€™s words were only a desire, not an express condition. Windco will likely prevail &amp; the term is 60 days for installation.</p><p>(ii) Shipping charge &amp; parol evidence.</p><p>Windco will argue that its additional term â€œ$200 shipping chargeâ€ was included, because Sam didnâ€™t object within 10 days. In support, Windco will offer parol evidence of the custom in the industry that shipping is borne by the buyer (here: Sam).</p><p>Sam will say that oral evidence of prior or contemporaneous terms are not admissible if the writing was fully integrated. Sam will also argue that the additional $200 is material &amp; onerous &amp; changed the bargain &amp; that therefore the $200 is not included.</p><p>Windco will however be able to introduce oral evidence</p><p>to explain &amp; clarify what the shipping term was intended to be and what is customary in the trade, as such explanatory evidence is not barred by the parol evidence rule. Also, $200 on top of $3,000 total is not a material additional charge, so Windco will likely prevail &amp; the $200 term is included.</p><p>B. Consideration is the bargained-for exchange of acts or promises incurring a benefit as well as new legal detriment to both parties. Here, Sam obtained goods (benefit) in exchange for having to pay Windco (new detriment). Vice versa for Windco.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-3-</p><p><br></p><p>1. Promissory estoppel. If for any reason an enforceable K is not found, promissory estoppel is a substitute where one party has reasonably relied to his detriment on the otherâ€™s promise. Here, Windco went ahead with the installation &amp; supplied the frames. Doing so, it detrimentally relied on Samâ€™s promise.</p><p>Consideration or its substitute existed. C. Defenses to Formation</p><p>1. Statute of Frauds (SOF). SOF requires Ks for goods valued at $500 or more to be in a sufficient writing. Here, the K was for a total of $3,000 and had to be in writing. Since Sam is the one to be charged the $200 in dispute, his signature was required by SOF, but the â€œAck of Orderâ€ was on Windco letterhead.</p><p>a. Merchantâ€™s confirming memo. Where one merchant sends the other a memo confirming an agreement that the other has reason to know of and understand, the memo suffices as a writing under SOF even if not signed by the one to be charged. Here, since the Ack of Order contained subject matter (windows), identity of the parties, price &amp; Windcoâ€™s signature (or on Windcoâ€™s letterhead), SOF is satisfied.</p><p>b. Divisible K. It can also be argued that the contract was a sequence of contracts, each for $100, and that each such K therefore was not within SOF. The $200 would then be for installation services (governed by common law; not UCC) which do not fall within the SOF goods provision. Since the services were to be provided within one year (here: within 60 days), that SOF provision also doesnâ€™t require a writing signed by Sam.</p><p>An enforceable K was formed with terms $200 shipping &amp; installation within 60 days.</p><p>D. Recovery.</p><p>1. Expectation interest. Windco will recover its expectation interest, i.e., the price it expected to obtain under the contract, which was $3,000 + $200 shipping. Even if the court decides the $200 term was not part of the K, Windco will get $3,000.</p><p>2. Consequential &amp; Delay damages. It W can show that it suffered damages as a consequence of not receiving Samâ€™s payment on time, it will be awarded also consequential damages, i.e., those amounts reasonably foreseeable to flow from Samâ€™s breach at K formation time. Here, since Sam is refusing only to pay the $200 (not the $3,000), consequentials shouldnâ€™t apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-4-</p><p><br></p><p>II. Sam v. Windco. A. Recovery</p><p>1. Consequentials. If the court finds that the time to performance was within 15 days, then Sam will recover consequentials (defined supra). Delay damages that both parties knew or should have known would result from Windcoâ€™s failure to install timely would be recoverable.</p><p>B. Breach of implied warranty.</p><p>Each product put into the stream of commerce carries an implied warranty that the goods are suited for their ordinary use. Here, window frames should be suited for use when itâ€™s raining, i.e., not leak[ing].</p><p>1. Parties. Plaintiff must be a purchaser or user. Here, Sam was the purchaser of the windows. Defendant must be one generally in the commercial supply chain. Here, Windco was (see supra under merchants). The parties are proper.</p><p>2. Merchantable. Defined supra. The product was defective due to a manufacturing defect in that the glass didnâ€™t fit properly; thus not fit for ordinary use (not merchantable).</p><p>3. Defenses. Windco will assert that it disclaimed all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Such a disclaimer is effective if conspicuous, as here printed in bold. Sam will however argue his purpose for entering into the K was to obtain windows that were functional and that Windco will be unjustly enriched if allowed to not compensate him so he can obtain other substitute goods (to â€œcoverâ€) &amp; be reimbursed by Windco for his expenses therefor.</p><p>4. Perfect tender rule. Under the UCC, where goods are to be delivered in a single delivery, the buyer (here: Sam) has a right to obtain perfectly conforming goods. Even though Sam didnâ€™t discover the defect (non-conformity) of the goods until later, he can still reject the lot, accept the lot or any portion thereof, upon timely notice to Windco. If Windco still has time under the contract (5 days left from 55 to 60 days) to perform it has a right to cure by replacing the windows.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-5-</p><p><br></p><p>WINDCO v. SAM</p><p>Does the UCC Apply?</p><p>Answer B to Question 1</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼The UCC applies to all contracts for the sale of goods. Goods are moveable, tangible property.</p><p>Here, the subject matter is shown to [be] predominately goods because â€œinstallation comprises 15% of Windcoâ€™s total price.â€</p><p>Therefore, the UCC applies. Merchants?</p><p>A merchant is one who regularly deals in goods of this kind or who, by his occupation, has some special skill or knowledge as to this type of goods.</p><p>Here, â€œWindco manufactures and installs insulated window-frame unitsâ€ and Sam, â€œa commercial dealer,â€ likely has special knowledge of windows.</p><p>Therefore, both parties are merchants.</p><p>Valid Contract</p><p>In order to determine if any rights exist we first must determine if there is a valid, enforceable contract. A contract consists of an offer, acceptance, consideration and lack of formation defenses.</p><p>Offer</p><p>An offer is manifestation of present contractual intent, communicated to an identified offeree, containing definite and certain terms.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s ad will be considered only an invitation to accept offers. When Sam mailed this order form he made an offer to Windco, containing terms (30 window frames @$100/frame). A reasonable person would believe Sam made a commitment to enter a contract because of this information.</p><p>Therefore, there is a valid offer.</p><p>Acceptance and Acceptance With Addition[al] Terms UCC2-207</p><p>An acceptance is an unequivocal assent to the terms of a[n] offer, unlike common law, where the acceptance must be the â€œmirror image.â€ The UCC allows additional terms.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-6-</p><p><br></p><p>At issue here are the terms Sam first added to his offer guaranteeing installation within 15 days. Windcoâ€™s acknowledgment of order altered this term guaranteeing installation â€œwithin 60 days.â€ As between merchants any additional term will become part of the contract unless the contract limits it to its own terms, there is an objection within 10 days, or the term materially alters the contract.</p><p>Here, while Sam wanted installation within 15 days, the question arises if this qualifies as a time is of the essence condition. Because Sam did not object upon receiving Windcoâ€™s acceptance with additional terms, it likely will be held that this is not a material term. And this term will become part of the contract.</p><p>Shipping cost language will not be a material term as â€œshipping costs are customarily borne by the buyer.â€</p><p>Warranty disclaimers are valid if conspicuous and use the term merchantability.</p><p>Therefore, unless a court finds the installation date guaranty to be a material term, all of these terms will become part of the contract.</p><p>Consideration</p><p>Consideration is a legally sufficient, bargained-for exchange.</p><p>Here, there appear to be no consideration issues as Sam is to pay money, Windco is to provide window frames which neither were legally obligated to do.</p><p>Defenses-Statute of Frauds (SOF)</p><p>Under the statute of frauds certain contracts must be evidenced by a writing to be enforceable. Contracts for goods of $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds.</p><p>Such contracts can be taken out of the statute of frauds by performance. Facts here state â€œWindco installed the windo[ws].â€ Therefore, this contract can be taken out of the SOF.</p><p>In any case, because there are documents authenticated by both parties (mail order form by Sam &amp; acknowledgment of order by Windco) that are writings sufficient to bring the contract within the statute of frauds.</p><p>Therefore, the statute of frauds will no[t] prevent this contract from being enforceable.</p><p>Unconscionability</p><p>Unconscionability arises if there can be shown both procedural and substantive unconsc ionabili ty.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s form stated â€œcontract of sale subject to terms herein.â€ Sam may attempt to claim this is substantively unconscionable, however to be procedurally</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-7-</p><p><br></p><p>unconscionable a party must show a lack of bargaining power. Nothing in the facts indicates that Sam could not have purchased window frames elsewhere. Further, to be substantively unconscionable the term must be one-sided. On these facts there is no indication Windco was greatly or significantly in a position to make such a windfall.</p><p>Therefore, unconscionability will fail as a defense. There is a valid enforceable contract.</p><p>Terms and Conditions</p><p>As shown above Windco performed by installing the windows. This condition precedent was fulfilled. It therefore falls upon Sam to meet his obligation or be in breach.</p><p>Breach</p><p>When one does not fulfill their obligation under a contract or excuse a condition they are in breach.</p><p>Here, Samâ€™s refusal to pay the $200 shipping fee is a breach. As noted above, this term became part of the contract because as shown by the usage in trade such a cost is â€œborne by the buyer.â€ Sam must pay the $200.</p><p>At issue here is the disclaimer of warranty discussed above. Often disclaimers of warranty can be material. However, as shown above, this disclaimer met the requirement of â€œbold &amp; conspicuousâ€ type and expressly mentioned â€œmerchantability and fitness.â€</p><p>Therefore, Sam will have no claim under either warranty or merchantability claim or a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. In fact, Sam did not indicate a particular purpose at time of contracting so as to become a basis of the bargain.</p><p>Remedies</p><p>As discussed above, Windco will receive the full contract price plus the $200 shipping fee.</p><p>However, if Sam can demonstrate that the late installation did cause the â€œseveral delay-related expensesâ€ th[at] he claims this will be considered a minor breach (usually timely performance is not a major breach and, as shown above, this contract does not qualify as a â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ contract).</p><p>Therefore, Sam will be able to offset the delay-related costs against the contract price, thus reducing his payment by that amount, because Windco will be found to have substantially performed. The court abhors a waste and will reduce Samâ€™s debt by the difference between what the building now is worth and what it would have been worth if the contract was fulfilled as expected.</p>', NULL, '<p>Windco Vs Sam</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);\">The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract.

He builds the house facing the wrong direction. The error does not cause the house to have any less market value, but lifting the house and turning it the right direction would cost $25,000.

Jon had seen and admired Debbieâ€™s â€œon locationâ€ photography work. He called Debbie to arrange for photography as part of his promotional plan for the spa. Jon told her that he planned to trim 50 pounds from his own considerably hefty frame by participating in the program of diet, exercise and strength training offered at the spa. He wanted to have â€œbefore and afterâ€ pictures taken of himself eating at the spa, working out on the spa exercise equipment and hiking along one of the spaâ€™s scenic trails. The photographs were to be displayed in strategic locations throughout the spa and would be included in the spaâ€™s brochure. Debbie stated that the total charge for the photography (which would consist of five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures and five â€œafterâ€ pictures) would be $1,000. The parties agreed that the â€œbeforeâ€ pictures would be taken on the following day.</p><p>When Debbie arrived at the spa, she learned for the first time that it was a health spa for nudists. Debbie was extremely uncomfortable, but the naked Jon persuaded her to stay and take the first set of pictures.</p><p>On the next day, Jon received the five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures and a letter from Debbie requesting immediate payment of $500, and stating that the five â€œafterâ€ pictures would be taken by her assistant upon notification that Jon had lost 50 pounds.</p><p>Jon consults you and asks the following questions:</p><p>1. Does an enforceable contract exist between Debbie and Jon? Discuss.</p><p>2. Assuming that an enforceable contract exists, can Jon require Debbie to take the â€œafterâ€ pictures personally? Discuss.</p><p>3. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>Answer A to Question 3</p><p>ï¿¼This is a contract primarily for services and will be analyzed using common law principles. Debbie is a photographer and contract is for services - taking the photographs (not for the photos themselves) for common law. UCC rules discussed when they apply only. (Uniform Commercial Code).</p><p>I. Don v. Debbie - Enforceable Contract? A. Formation</p><p>1. Mutual Assent</p><p>a. Offer must contain subject matter, definite terms, and intention to be bound. Here, Jon called Debbie and discussed the 10 photos and their purpose, the terms, and expressed intention to be bound. Offer is valid.</p><p>b. Acceptance. Must be a mirror image agreement to the offer and express the intention to be bound. Here, Debbie accepts Jonâ€™s offer, and both agree to the specific terms.</p><p>c. Consideration. Is a bargained fo r exchange of legal detriment. Here, Debbie agrees to take pictures in exchange for Jonâ€™s payment of money. Consideration is adequate.</p><p>II. Defenses</p><p>A. Statute of Frauds - (SOF) valuable and easily misunderstood contracts must be in writing.</p><p>1) UCC $500 Rule - In order for the contract to be enforceable, it must be in writing if the value of the goods is more than $500 (valuable). Here, under UCC, a writing is necessary. But because this contract is primarily a services contract, it would be enforceable without a writing.</p><p>a. One year rule - Both UCC and Non-UCC. If a contract, at time at formation, cannot be performed within one year, a writing is necessaryforthecontracttobeenforceable. Here,(hopefully) Jon can lose 50# in less than one year, and this rule does not apply. The contract is valid without a written contract.</p><p>b. Impossibility/Impracticability</p><p>If there are intervening events that occur which are unforeseeable, the performance is excused (leg. [sic] illegality destruction of subject matter, death/incapacity of the parties).</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-22-</p><p><br></p><p>Here, Debbie became uncomfortable when she found out that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp. She would try to assert that being uncomfortable once was enough; the second time was impossible for her.</p><p>c. Mistake</p><p>When Ã¢Debbie did not know that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp, Ã£Jon did not tell her that it was a nudist camp, and Ã¤neither party knew (at formation) that Debbie was not comfortable in the nudist camp, there was a mutual mistake. The contract is voidable by either party.</p><p>Unilateral mistake - If Jon could argue that Debbie should ha ve known or asked about certain circumstances that precluded her work, he can prevail on this issue.</p><p>If Debbie can show that Jon should have told her that his spa was a nudist camp, Debbie would prevail. The mistake is chargeable to the more unreasonable party.</p><p>d. Detrimental Reliance - Promissory Estoppel</p><p>Partial performance - Jon would argue that there was a partial performance by Debbie and that he relied reasonably and detrimentally that Debbie would finish the job.</p><p>e. Modification</p><p>At common law, modification requires additional consideration. At UCC, only good faith is necessary. Consideration substitutes can be used, e.g. detrimental reliance, supra. Here, Debbie wishes to modify contract from $1,000 for 10 photos to $500 for 5 photos. She can prevail at common law if she can show additional consideration, or, at UCC, good faith. But Jon has no consideration. This modification is not valid.</p><p>III. Can Jon require Debbie to take â€œafterâ€ pictures?</p><p>A. Delegation of Duty - Courts favor assignment and delegation. The delegation must be with the consent of the obligee or must not be to his detriment. Here, if Jon does not want to give consent for delegation of duty to Debbieâ€™s assistant, he must show that there is diminution in value of the services.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-23-</p><p><br></p><p>B. Personal Services - Contracts are not assignable. If Jon can assert that Debbieâ€™s services were so personal that her duties cannot be delegated, he would prevail. Debbie would argue that photography is not like a portrait and that an equally qualified photographer (such as her assistant) could perform just as well. However, courts are reluctant to enforce specific performance on personal service contracts. Damages would likely be in expectation damages.</p><p>IV. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time?</p><p>A. Express v. Constructive Conditions</p><p>All express conditions must be completely performed to avoid breach. Constructive conditions must be substantially performed to avoid breach. Here, the question would be whether there was an express (v. constructive) condition that the total job would need to be completed before payment in order to avoid breach. The courts wonâ€™t likely construe this to mean the entire contract.</p><p>B. Divisible Contract?</p><p>If Debbie can successfully argue that the contract consisted of 2 parts (before and after) she would be entitled to partial payment for partial performance. This is not a divisible contract and Jon would prevail.</p><p>C. Modification valid?</p><p>No, for inadequate consideration, supra.</p><p>D. Quasi - Contract Recovery</p><p>In order to avoid unjust enrichment the court considers recovery in Quasi-Contracts. Traditionally, only the non-breaching party could recover. In modern law, the breaching party could also recover if the breach were not willful and in good faith. Here, Debbie would be able to recover $500 for value of the before photographs, because her breach was in good faith.</p><p>V. Damages under UCC</p><p>1. Sellerâ€™s breach - When seller breaches, the buyer is entitled to market price minus contract price. Alternatively, buyer can â€œcover.â€</p><p>A buyer is entitled to seek replacement from another buyer and sue the seller for the difference.</p><p>ï¿¼-24-</p><p><br></p><p>Answer B to Question 3</p><p>Enforceable Contract Between Debbie and Jon? Since this is not a contract for goods common law will be the authority. 1. Contract?</p><p>A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty and the breach of which the law will provide a remedy [sic]. It consists of mutual assent and [is] supported by consideration.</p><p>2. Was There an Offer by Debbie?</p><p>An offer is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree such that a reasonable person would conclude that a bargain had been formed. Under common law an offer must include: parties, subject matter, price, and time and quantity. Here the parties are implied because she is â€œstatingâ€ this to Jon.</p><p>The quantity is stated as â€œ5 before pic[ture]s and 5 afterâ€ pictures. The price is â€œ$1,000 dollars and the time is the next dayâ€. Therefore there is a valid offer here.</p><p>3. Acceptance?</p><p>An acceptance is an affirmative assent communicated to the offeror in the manner requested, if not requested then in a reasonable manner. An acceptance to a bilateral offer may be by return promise or by performance.</p><p>Here there is an acceptance because â€œthe parties agreedâ€ that the before pictures would be taken the following day. Therefore Jon assented to the onset of Debbieâ€™s performance.</p><p>4. Consideration?</p><p>Is a bargained-for exchange that causes legal detriment. Here there is consideration because Debbie is promising to take photographs (using her professional skills and time) and Jon is promising to pay Debbie $1,000.</p><p>5. Statute of Frauds?</p><p>The statute requires that certain contracts be reduced to writing to be enforceable. One of these is for goods $500 and over. Although this seems like a contract for Debbieâ€™s services as a photographer, she is also producing tangible moveable goods. The goods were not moveable at the time the contract was formed, however, and therefore the statute would not apply. Therefore a contract exists and</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-26-</p><p><br></p><p>it is enforceable.</p><p>Contract?</p><p>Jon v. Debbie</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Assuming a contract exists, supra, what are the rights Jon may assert?</p><p>Was there an enforceable delegation from Debbie to assistant?</p><p>The law favors delegations. A delegation occurs when one party delegates his duties under an existing contract to a third party.</p><p>Here there is a delegation because Debbie says â€œthe after pictures would be taken by the assistant.â€</p><p>Is the delegation binding on the assistant? A delegation is binding on the delegatee only if they knowingly consent; usually consideration is involved. There are no facts stating whether the assistant consented. One could reasonably assume she was being compensated and consideration would exist.</p><p>Debbie would remain liable for performance as the delegator. Are there exceptions to an enforceable delegation? Exceptions -</p><p>1. Prohibited by contract;</p><p>2. Prohibited by statute;</p><p>3. Too personal in nature.</p><p>Here there may be a valid exception because it could be argued that the artistry of a â€œwell known photographerâ€ is too personal in nature to delegate.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be able to delegate her services. Can Jon demand that Debbie take the pictures?</p><p>Where specific performance would require one to personally perform it will not be enforced based on a prohibition on involuntary servitude.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be forced to perform. She may, however, be enjoined from performing elsewhere during that time.</p><p>Her discomfort may be a factor to rebut based on impracticability. Debbie v. Jon</p><p>If Debbie doesnâ€™t perform is she entitled to partial compensation?</p><p>ï¿¼-27-</p><p><br></p><p>If Debbieâ€™s â€œextreme discomfortâ€ can be shown to make performance impracticable she may be entitled to services already rendered.</p><p>Impracticability exists where a reasonably unforeseeable intervening event, the risk of which was not assumed by either party, makes performance extremely difficult; the duties of the parties may be discharged. Here may be reasonably unforeseeable because â€œit was a nudist camp and Debbie didnâ€™t find out about it until that day. There is no indication she assumed this risk. In order to be successful, she would have to [show] that it would be very difficult to perform the contract. Since â€œJon persuaded her to stayâ€ the first time, it may be difficult.</p><p>She may be able to recover quantum meruit for the services already provided.</p><p>She may argue that there was a divisible contract and recover under this theory. â€œJon received the 5 before picturesâ€ and Debbieâ€™s demand for payment. There is nothing in the contract telling us there is a separate delivery for a separate payment.</p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:26', 1),

Rather than inflicting the intended leg wound, the bullet ricocheted off the sidewalk and hit Vic in the heart, killing him instantly.</p><p>1. With what crime or crimes should Dan be charged? Discuss. </p><p>2. What defense or defenses might Dan assert? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>AGGRAVATED ASSAULT</p><p>Answer A to Question 2 STATE V. DAN (D)</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Assault is either a substantial step toward an intended battery or the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm. Modernly, an aggravated assault is an assault committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D shot at Vic (V), intending to wound him. If V was apprehensive of being shot, D will be guilty of assault. Additionally, because D shot at V with a deadly weapon, a gun, D will modernly be guilty of aggravated assault.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated assault. However, the assault will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>AGGRAVATED BATTERY</p><p>Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another. Modernly, a battery is aggravated if it is committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, D intended to wound V by shooting V in the leg. However, the bullet actually killed V by striking him elsewhere. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, D will be guilty of the battery because the intended harm was criminal, and there is great similarity between the intended harm and the harm that actually occurred. Furthermore, because D used a gun to batter V, D will be guilty of aggravated battery.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated battery, though it will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>HOMICIDE OF V</p><p>HOMICIDE is the killing of a human being by another human being. Here, the facts indicate that D killed V by shooting at V with a gun. There is a homicide.</p><p>CAUSATION - ACTUAL CAUSE</p><p>But for D shooting at V, V would not have died.</p><p>CAUSATION - PROXIMATE CAUSE</p><p>It is foreseeable that shooting to someone with intent to injure could result in a death.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼MURDER</p><p>ï¿¼-12-</p><p><br></p><p>Murder is an unlawful homicide committed with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought may be proven under any of four theories.</p><p>1) INTENT TO KILL - Intent requires the conscious desire to cause the criminal result. The facts indicate that D only intended to wound V, not kill V. Thus, D did not have the specific intent to kill.</p><p>2) INTENT TO INFLICT SERIOUS BODILY HARM - Here, the facts indicate that D shot at V with the intent to hitting [sic] V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg is likely to cause serious bodily harm and the facts indicate that D intended to wound V. Under this theory, then, D intended to cause serious bodily harm.</p><p>3) DEPRAVED HEART ACT - A depraved heart act is a wanton and reckless disregard for the value of human life. Here, D shot at V in a public place with an intent to wound V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg present[s] numerous, dangerous risk[s] to his welfare and court[s] normally hold that any act that [is] likely to cause serious harm to others is a depraved heart act if the risk is disregarded.</p><p>4) APPLICATION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE - A killing will be felony if it 1) occurs during the res gestae of a dangerous felony or a felony committed in a dangerous way, 2) is foreseeable, and 3) is independent of the target crime. Here, the State will not bring a charge of felony murder, because the only predicate felonies would merge with the crime. Because of public policy reasons, courts refuse to apply felony murder to felonious assaults and batteries, otherwise, strict liability for first degree murder would result from each killing.</p><p>Having found malice under the theories of 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, the State will proceed as follows.</p><p>FIRST DEGREE MURDER</p><p>First degree murder is an unlawful homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation and specific intent to kill. Premeditation and deliberation may be proven by application of the felony murder rule, or a killing by poison, bomb, torture, or ambush.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D lacked the specific intent to kill and the felony murder rule will not apply. The State will not bring a charge of first degree murder.</p><p>SECOND DEGREE MURDER</p><p>All murder not raised to the first degree shall be second degree murder.</p><p>Here, because the State proved malice under two theories, but did not raise the charge to first degree murder, the State will bring a charge of second degree murder. Because the State established malice under 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, D will be guilty of second degree murder absent a defense.</p><p>D will be guilty of second degree murder.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-13-</p><p><br></p><p>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional homicide committed with malice, but with mitigation. Mitigation may be proven by adequate provocation or mistaken justification.</p><p>Here, D may try to claim that he was provoked into shooting V. However, the first element of adequate provocation requires that a reasonable person be provoked by the conduct. Here, a reasonable person would not have been provoked by Vâ€™s approach, so V may not claim provocation. Additionally, D may claim that his defense of self-defense is imperfect and results in a charge of voluntary manslaughter. As discussed infra, D will raise a defense of self-defense, and this defense will be imperfect. A court may apply this rule of mitigation to lessen the offense to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>The State may bring a charge of voluntary manslaughter. D will be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he succeeds in mitigating his crime by an imperfect self- defense claim.</p><p>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide that results from 1) application of the misdemeanor manslaughter rule, 2) intent to inflict non-serious bodily harm, 3) criminal negligence.</p><p>Here, D will try to mitigate his charge by claiming that the homicide was only involuntary manslaughter. D will claim that he only intended non-serious bodily harm and the killing was accidental. However, court[s] consistently hold that any intent to harm with a deadly weapon infers an intent to inflict serious bodily harm.</p><p>Additionally, D may claim that he was only criminally negligent, not reckless. Dâ€™s claim may work depending on the surrounding situation of the terrain.</p><p>The State may charge D with the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>DEFENSES TO HOMICIDE</p><p>SELF-DEFENSE</p><p>Self-defense [is] the actual and reasonable apprehensions of bodily harm.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he believed V would harm him. However, this belief is not reasonable, because a reasonable person would not have assumed Vâ€™s approach</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-14-</p><p><br></p><p>meant V intended to do harm. Furthermore, D used unreasonable force because V was not threatening any harm.</p><p>Dâ€™s claim of self-defense will fail, but may constitute an imperfect self-defense that mitigates the homicide, as discussed supra.</p><p>INSANITY - Mâ€™NAUGHTEN RULE</p><p>The defendant is entitled to acquittal, if at the time of the crimes and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) did not know the nature or quality of his act, 2) or that his act was wrong.</p><p>Under this rule, D may claim that he believed V was going to attack D and kill D. If D subjectively held this belief, then he would have been permitted to defend himself. Even though this believe was unreasonable, in jurisdictions applying the Mâ€™Naughten rule, D may not have believed his act was wrong.</p><p>D may be able to escape guilt under the Mâ€™Naughten rule.</p><p>INSANITY - MODEL PENAL CODE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if at the time of the crime and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, or 2) did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>Even though D was capable of conforming to the requirements of the law, he may claim that he did not know his act was wrong, because he believed he needed to defend himself. In jurisdictions holding to the MPC insanity position, D would need to prove he did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>D may avoid guilt under the MPC test for insanity.</p><p>IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TEST</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the result of an irresistible impulse that overcame his will.</p><p>Under this test, D would need to prove he was unable to control himself when he shot V. This test would p robably no t provide a defens e becaus e D could h ave controlled himself, he just thought he needed to defend himself.</p><p>D will probably be guilty in jurisdictions applying the irresistible impulse test.</p><p>DURHAM RULE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the product of a mental defect.</p><p>Here, Dâ€™s crime appears to be the product of a mental defect. That is, D believed V would kill D because of a delusion.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-15-</p><p><br></p><p>In the minority of jurisdictions that apply the Durham Rule, D may avoid guilt because the crime was the product of mental defect.</p><p>WELLS-GORSHEN RULE</p><p>Under the Wells-Gorshen rule, insanity defenses that do not give rise to absolute defenses may negate the mens rea requirement of a crime.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he lacked the mens rea to commit murder because he thought V was going to do harm to D. However, under the malice theories, the State proved that D intended to harm V. Even though D thought he was acting in self-defense, he still intended this harm.</p><p>The Wells-Gorshen rule will not apply here.</p><p>DIMINISHED CAPACITY</p><p>Here, D may try to argue that his delusions diminished his capacity to form the intent to commit murder. This rule only applies in a small minority of jurisdictions and usually is applicable only to negate the mens rea of a crime. Here, D is not seeking to negate the mens rea.</p><p>Diminished capacity will not apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-16-</p><p><br></p><p>CHARLES V. DAN</p><p>HOMICIDE CHARGES.</p><p>Answer B to Question 2</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Murder: Murder is the voluntary taking of the life of another with malice. Malice can be shown by perpetratorâ€™s intent to kill, by his being responsible for death during commission of a dangerous felony (â€œfelony murderâ€), by acting in a manner demonstrating a wanton disregard for human life, or by intending to inflict serious injury.</p><p>Here, Dan is on a busy street and is approached by someone he imagines intends to hurt him. Dan is carrying a concealed weapon, a gun, with which he shoots in Vicâ€™s direction intending, he says, â€œonly to wound him,â€ but a ricochet bullet kills Vic.</p><p>-There is clearly a homicide and Dan is clearly the cause. But for Danâ€™s firing, voluntarily, the gun, Vic would not be dead.</p><p>-Intent: First degree murder is a specific intent crime, usually shown by evidence of premeditation and deliberation, or by felony murder. Felony murder is not likely to apply here. Though crimes of carrying [a] concealed weapon and criminal assault might be felonies, the shooting did not occur in furtherance of these crimes. So, premeditation and deliberation are the focus [sic]. A case can be made that Dan premeditated this crime by the fact that he was carrying a concealed gun. Moreover, deliberation can occur in a very short time; even a momentâ€™s deliberation can be enough to sustain the charges. Here Dan thought about his act long enough to consider Vicâ€™s â€œscruffyâ€ appearance to be a threat to him, and to decide to shoot.</p><p>Second Degree Murder</p><p>Intent to inflict serious bodily harm satisfies the malice requirement. Vic shot â€œto wound Vic in the legs.â€ A bullet to the legs is surely serious bodily harm, so Vic can be found to have malice on this basis.</p><p>Likewise, Vicâ€™s shooting a gun on a â€œbusy streetâ€ is likely â€œwanton disregard for human lifeâ€ so that Vicâ€™s malice can be shown to be based upon â€œdepraved heart.â€</p><p>Finally, the killing of a person by â€œdangerous meansâ€ as a lethal weapon, here, a gun, is sufficient to establish intent.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Prosecutor can charge Dan with first degree murder based upon his intent, shown by carrying and firing [a] gun on [a] busy street and his premeditation. Second degree murder included.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Assault and Battery</p><p>ï¿¼-17-</p><p><br></p><p>Criminal assault merges into battery where the threat which constitutes assault occurs simultaneously with the harmful touching required for battery.</p><p>Criminal battery is the harmful or offensive touching of another without consent. The touching may be indirect so long as a physical touching occurs and the object which touches was set in motion by the perpetrator. Here Dan clearly caused the bullet to â€œtouchâ€ Vic in harmful manner.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Vic can be charged with criminal assault and battery. N.B. Legal statutes may result in a gun charge v. Dan. Defenses For Dan</p><p>Justification</p><p>A justification excuses the crime and results in â€œno crime.â€ Here, Dan will argue self- defense as justification. Self-defense excuses a killing if the perpetrator acted reasonably (general intent) and in good faith (specific and general intent crimes) to protect self from serious bodily injury or death and if the actions in defense were proportionate to the threat.</p><p>Here, Dan will argue he only acted to save himself from Vic, whom he believed intended to kill him, and that deadly force was proportionate and justified.</p><p>However, since Vic made no threatening gestures toward Dan and there are facts suggesting Vic was brandishing a weapon, a reasonable person in Danâ€™s position would not have concluded his life was in jeopardy. So Danâ€™s excuse falls in the majority. His â€œgood faithâ€ alone is irrelevant to second degree murder, a general intent crime. In a minority of jurisdictions, if his mistake is found to be in â€œhonestâ€ or in â€œgood faith,â€ the crime may be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Self-defense is not likely available to Dan.</p><p>Excuses:</p><p>Dan will defend saying he did not have the requisite intent for murder.</p><p>He will say he only intended to wound Vic. However, as discussed above, both the specific intent for first degree murder and general intent for second degree are supported by his acts. His intent to do serious bodily harm by wounding Vic with a bullet, the use of a gun, [and] the thinking he did before firing all support Vicâ€™s having requisite intent for murder, arguably first degree.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-18-</p><p><br></p><p>Insanity</p><p>In majority the defense of insanity is established if, at the time of the offense, the perpetrator was suffering from a serious mental defect or disease such that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act or to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law (A.L.I).</p><p>Here, while Dan is described as having a â€œpathological fearâ€ of long -haired persons, we do not know if he has had an established diagnosis of serious mental illness. If he does have such a defect or disease, Dan will have to show that his delusional state was of the kind that anyone believing as he did would have acted in the manner he did or that his disease caused him to lack substantial capacity to understand that he was shooting someone or that it is a crime to do so.</p><p>Involuntary Manslaughter</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another in a state of passion or high emotional arousal caused by a provocation, more than mere words, that would have aroused such emotion in any reasonable person in that position, and that th ere was no time for the person to â€œcool offâ€, and that he did not, in fact, cool off.</p><p>Here Dan will argue that Vicâ€™s coming toward him looking as he did caused Dan to be so afraid that he acted in a state of high emotion.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Danâ€™s arousal is not that which a reasonable person in his situation would experience. Danâ€™s mental illness is not considered in this formulation.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Charges of murder in first degree will lie against Dan, though they may be dropped to second degree murder. Danâ€™s defenses will fail, except possibly the insanity defense, for which we have insufficient information to decide.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:27:41', 1),

Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p><br></p><p>I. Child vs. Zoo</p><p>Answer A to Question 4</p><p>ï¿¼Strict Liability. For the child to recover against zoo in strict liability she must simply show that the wild animal causing her injury was owned by or under the care of the zoo and that she suffered injury that were [sic] of the type consistent with foreseeable harm by the wild animal. This is because owners/caretakers of wild animals are strictly liable for the reasonable and foreseeable harm caused by the wild animal.</p><p>Here, the zebra was clearly under the care/control of the zoo when it escaped from its cage. As such, zoo would be strictly liable for any reasonable/foreseeable harm the animal causes.</p><p>Zoo will argue that the child assumed the risk when it petted the zebra and offered itastickofcandy. However,giventhefactthatthezebraisgenerallyconsidered to be a wild animal, and that it is foreseeable that it could bite if in close proximity to a person, this would not relieve zooâ€™s liability.</p><p>II. Child vs. Zoo</p><p>Negligence. For child to recover against zoo in negligence, she must show duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages.</p><p>[Note: Zooâ€™s liability would be based on various liability under the theory of respondeat superior as the zooâ€™s employer (Maintenance Man), and the performance of his duty, set into motion the series of events that resulted in childâ€™s injury.]</p><p>Duty. Dutyariseswhenthereisalegallyrecognizedrelationshipbetweenplaintiff and defendant that results in defendant having to act is [sic] some fashion other than arbitrarily towards plaintiff. The duty owed is one of reasonable care towards all foreseeable plaintiffs in the zone of danger created by defendantâ€™s negligence.</p><p>At common law, duty was largely based on oneâ€™s status in relationship to defendant. One could be an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser. Here the child plaintiff was not on defendantâ€™s property at the time of the accident, but rather was in a residential area â€œnearbyâ€ the zoo. As zoo is in the business of housing, caring for, and maintaining wild animals, it should be reasonably foreseeable that an accident could arise that would result in an animal being left loose in the nearby community, and because of the nature of a wild animalâ€™s behavior, harm could have resulted to a person in the nearby community. This is particularly true where children are around.</p><p>BreachofDuty. Breachofdutyariseswhendefendantâ€™sactionsdonotrisetothe standard of care required by the law. Here, Learned Handâ€™s approach would note that the zoo breached its duty if the cost incurred with avoiding the harm causing incident was less than the product of the probability of the harm causing incident</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-30-</p><p><br></p><p>arising and the magnitude of loss should the harm causing event occur.</p><p>Here, a fire caused a large water main to break with the ensuing rush of water washing away a portion of the zebraâ€™s pen fence. When considering a pen fence, (as opposed to a sturdy cage), itâ€™s entirely foreseeable that a sudden deluge of water could wash away a portion of the â€œfence.â€ As such, the zoo should have ensured construction of a caged facility that would be sturdy enough to withstand this type of accident.</p><p>The cost involved with the construction of a pen of this nature would be significantly less than the potential danger that a wild animal could cause to men, women, and children in a nearby area should that animal escape. As such, it could be argued that the zoo breached its duty.</p><p>Causation. For liability to arise, the zoo (or in this case, the zooâ€™s employee) would have to be both actual and primary cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Actual Cause. Actual cause arises when â€œbut forâ€ defendantâ€™s actions, plaintiff would not have been injured. Here, the zooâ€™s maintenance employee threw a pile of cleaning rags saturated with a flammable cleaning fluid into a hot, enclosed room. The mainten ance man should ha ve known that there was the potential for the rags igniting resulting in a fire. When this happened, the fire set into motion a series of events that resulted in the zebra getting free and the child being bitten. As such, â€œbut forâ€ the maintenance manâ€™s action, the childâ€™s injury would not have occurred.</p><p>Proximate Cause. Arises when a result is the natur[al] and probable/reasonable and foreseeable consequences of defendantâ€™s actions. Here, we look to see if the injury is of the type reasonably expected, or was significantly more severe than reasonably expected. Here, there was a fire, that resulted in a water main bursting, that resulted in a fence being washed away, that led to a zebra escaping, that resulted in a child being bitten by the zebra. The zoo could reasonably argue that the type of injury resulting to the child was not of the type that would be the foreseeable natural consequence of a fire that caused a water main to break. As such, they could avoid liability as the maintenance manâ€™s actions would not be the proximate cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Defenses. Atcommonlaw,contributingnegligencewasacompletebartorecovery. Here, the zoo could argue that the child was contributorily negligent when she petted the zebra and fed it candy. If the court argued, child would be barred from recovery.</p><p>Comparative Fault. Today, most jurisdictions have adopted comparative fault. Here, the could [sic] would weight [sic] the percentage of responsibility on each of the parties and assess damages accordingly. If child was less at fault than zoo, she could recover accordingly.</p><p>Assumption of Risk. If it can be shown that the child knew the consequences of her actions and knowingly embraced the danger, this could bar her from recovery. This would be a matter of fact for the court to decide.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-31-</p><p><br></p><p>Child v. Zoo Strict Liability</p><p>Answer B to Question 4</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Owners of trespassing wild animals will be held strictly liable (no fault need be shown) for damages proximately caused by the animals.</p><p>Zebra a Wild Animal?</p><p>A wild animal is one that is not domesticated (does not serve man). A zebra is a wild animal because its only use is to be displayed in a zoo. This zebra is from a zoo and thus is considered wild.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>The damage to the child was both actually (BUT-FOR TEST) and proximately (LEGALLY) caused by the zebra because the zebra bit off the childâ€™s fingers [sic]. But for this biting, the child would not have lost his fingers [sic]. There are no superseding causes.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>The child lost his fingers [sic].</p><p>Defense.</p><p>Because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability, the only question is whether Child assumed the risk.</p><p>ASSUMPTION OF RISK requires plaintiff to understand the nature and extent of the risk and to disregard that risk. Here there is no evidence that Child apprehended a risk when approaching the Zebra. Indeed, Childâ€™s offer of candy was a friendly gesture that showed Child probably was comfortable and had no idea that his fingers were in danger.</p><p>Therefore Child did not assume the risk of injury.</p><p>Domestic Animal?</p><p>Zoo could try to claim that, like a horse, a Zebra is a domestic animal, and as such, Zoo would not be strictly liable unless the zebra had known dangerous tendencies. However, this claim should be dismissed because a zebra only looks like a horse; they [sic] are not, however, domesticated.</p><p>Under the facts Child should be able to recover from Zoo in Strict Liability. Negligence?</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-33-</p><p><br></p><p>Negligence is conduct that falls below the standard of care set by law to protect others from unreasonable risk of harm.</p><p>Here Child may also assert a claim in negligence if he can show that Zoo breached an owed duty to him, actually and proximately causing Childâ€™s damages.</p><p>Vicarious Liability</p><p>Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR Zoo will be liable for torts committed by its employees if they act within the scope of their duties.</p><p>Here the maintenance employee was doing his duties, cleaning up, when he threw the rag into the hot room. Zoo will be liable for any tort arising from this act if it is tortious.</p><p>Duty.</p><p>Zoo owes a duty to act as a reasonable zoo. In addition, as possessor of land, they owe a duty not to harm others outside their land by activities on the land.</p><p>Breach.</p><p>Under Cardozo from the Palsgraf decision a duty is owed to all foreseeable plaintiffs, generally within the zone of the activity. Here it is foreseeable that an escaped Zebra would run into civilians and so Zoo was under a duty to be very careful this wouldnâ€™t happen.</p><p>Here Zoo breached this duty in possibly several ways.</p><p>1. First, Child could argue that Zooâ€™s employee was negligent in not realizing that a rag soaked with a flammable liquid could spontaneously combust in a hot enclosed room. This, however, is a poor argument because most maintenance men do not have that understanding of physics and chemistry.</p><p>2. Second, Child could claim that Zoo did not build a strong enough fence to keep the zebras penned in. This is not so strong either because the force from the broken water main probably exceeded any natural force that could reasonably be foreseen. But if the fence was not strong for normal wear and tear Child could show breach here.</p><p>3. A third argument, much better, is that Zoo has a duty to notice when wild animals escape and has ready plans to round them up or tranquilize them if they do escape. Here it seems Zoo did nothing while the zebra ran away.</p><p>Therefore Zoo has breached its duty to control its animals.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>Zoo might claim that the Childâ€™s offer of candy was superseding cause that breaks</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-34-</p><p><br></p><p>the chain of proximate causation. However, Child would have to be doing something independent and unforeseeable for Zoo to prevail. While carrying candy is not a response to an escaped zebra, it is not unforeseeable that a child should have candy, nor is it unforeseeable that such a child might offer it to the zebra.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>Discussed supra.</p><p>Defenses.</p><p>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is conduct by the plaintiff that fails to conform to the standard of care set by law for the plaintiffâ€™s own protection.</p><p>Here a CHILD STANDARD OF CARE applies. Child will be expected to act as a reasonable child of similar age, experience, and education will act in similar circumstances.</p><p>Here Childâ€™s behavior is typical of a â€œyoung childâ€ and is therefore not negligent. ASSUMPTION OF RISK fails for the similar reason as discussed supra. Therefore Child could also recover for his damages under Negligence theory.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:57', 1),

Otherwise the varying terms are considered only â€œproposed modificationsâ€.</p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>8.&nbsp;Had the OFFER LAPSED before acceptance was attempted?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition: </b>Under common law an offer <b>LAPSES AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED</b> unless it is accepted in a <b>reasonable period</b> of time. Oral offers are deemed to lapse at the end of the conversation, and written offers are deemed to lapse within the timeframe implied by the means of dispatch, absent contrary agreement or implication.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>9.&nbsp;Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Definition: Under the MAILBOX RULES of the common law an acceptance is effective when dispatched, if dispatched in the <b>manner specified</b> in the offer, or by the <b>same or faster </b>means the offer was transmitted where the offer does not specify a means of communication.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>10.&nbsp;Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REJECTION?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b> Under the MAILBOX RULES of contract law a rejection is effective upon receipt while an acceptance may be effective upon dispatch. An EXCEPTION is made if the <b>OFFEROR CHANGES POSITION</b> in reliance upon a communication of rejection, not knowing that an acceptance was dispatched prior to receipt of the rejection. In that case the rejection is effective upon receipt regardless of the fact an acceptance was also dispatched.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>11.&nbsp;Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REVOCATION?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b>&nbsp;Under the MAILBOX RULES revocation of a contract offer is usually <b>effective upon receipt</b> by the offeree.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">For an unequivocal unilateral offer also say, as appropriate, Under common law a unilateral offer could be revoked at any time, and revocation of GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, was effective when published in the same manner the offer was first announced. But modernly SAVING DOCTRINES prevent the revocation of a unilateral contract offer if the offeror is <b>aware the offeree has commenced the requested act </b>for a reasonable period during which the offeree will be allowed to complete acceptance by performance.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>12.&nbsp;Was there an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b> Under contract law an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT will be deemed to have existed, even if there is no express agreement between the parties, if <b>one party acts to bestow benefits </b>on the other party <b>reasonably expecting to be compensated</b>, and the other party <b>knowingly accepts those benefits</b> knowing that the other party expects to be compensated.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">An implied-in-fact contract is an actual, legal contract. The party that knowingly receives the benefits is liable for a reasonable contract amount to the other party.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>13.&nbsp;Is a WRITING needed?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If ONLY common law governs say,</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition: </b>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be written in order to be legally enforced, and one type is a contract for (pick one if it applies here -- MARRIAGE, more than a YEAR, LAND, EXECUTOR of an estate, GUARANTEE of a debt).</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Remember:</b> My Leg</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If UCC say,<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition: </b>Under UCC 2-201, a contract for <b>sale</b> of <b>goods</b> worth <b>$500 or more</b> must evidenced by a writing sufficient to show the existence of a contract and <b>signed</b> by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. But between merchants a SALES CONFIRMATION by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Furthermore, the UCC provides exceptions for <b>SPECIAL MADE</b> GOODS, where there is an <b>ADMISSION</b> by the party to be bound that there had been an agreement, or where there has been <b>PARTIAL PERFORMANCE</b> of the contract (i.e. acceptance of some or all goods or payment).<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under UCC 2-209 contract modifications must be written to be legally enforceable if the contract, as modified, is for over $500. Otherwise modification agreements will be treated as waivers of conditions that can be always be retracted, unless the Court estops retraction to prevent injustice.</font></p><hr><p><b style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">B. Contract Terms</b></p><p><b style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">14.&nbsp;What were the CONTRACT TERMS?</b><br></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If an acceptance forms a contract, for common law say, </font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under common law enforceable contracts generally must indicate <b>PARTIES</b>, <b>PRICE</b>, <b>SUBJECT</b> <b>MATTER</b>, <b>TIME OF PERFORMANCE</b> and <b>QUANTITY</b>. Most express terms and promises are considered to be EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS, <b>except for TIME</b> of performance, buyer <b>SATISFACTION</b>, and <b>promises NOT TO ASSIGN</b> the contract which are generally considered mere â€œcovenantsâ€.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If an acceptance forms a contract, for UCC say, </font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under the UCC a contract is enforceable if the <b>QUANTITY</b> and <b>PARTIES</b> are specified. Other terms will be provided by the GAP FILLER provisions of the UCC. All express terms and promises are treated as material terms under the PERFECT TENDER RULE.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>15.&nbsp;Was TIMELY PERFORMANCE a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law the parties may <b>agree at the time of contract execution</b> that <b>timely performance</b>&nbsp;is a MATERIAL CONDITION. Then the condition is called an EXPRESS CONDITION, and typically the contract says, â€œTime is of the essenceâ€.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">But material conditions may also be or <b>implied</b> when the <b>parties knew at the time of execution </b>that <b>tardy performance would deny the non-performing party the BENEFIT OF THE&nbsp;BARGAIN</b>, the benefit expected when they entered into the agreement. In that case the condition is called an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION.</font><br></p><p><b>16.&nbsp;Was Buyer SATISFACTION a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>Under contract law reasonably satisfactory performance by the parties is ALWAYS AN IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract. However, the parties may agree that buyer SATISFACTION is a MATERIAL CONDITION so buyers who are <b>not actually satisfied</b> have no legal duty to pay. </p><p>But if the terms of the agreement do not expressly and unequivocally state that the parties intended for <b>personal</b> satisfaction to be a material condition, the Court will generally hold that a promise of â€œsatisfactionâ€ was merely a â€œcovenantâ€ to perform in a manner that would be satisfactory to a â€œreasonable personâ€ and NOT a material condition UNLESS the service to be performed was one that is highly subject to personal tastes.</p><p><b>17.&nbsp;Does the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE bar evidence of other covenants and terms?</b></p><p>Under the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE evidence of PRIOR or CONTEMPORANEOUS agreements may not be introduced to VARY or CONTRADICT the terms of a <b>FULLY INTEGRATED WRITING</b> unless it is to show evidence of [DAM FOIL] Duress, Ambiguity,&nbsp;Mistake, Fraud, Oral condition precedent, Illegality, or Lack of consideration. The Court may determine the â€œcompletenessâ€ of a written contract by examining the comprehensiveness of its contents.</p><hr><p><b>C. Defenses</b></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>18.

However, the modification may be viewed by the Court as a WAIVER OF CONDITION that the waiving party has a legal right to retract, but the Court may estop the retraction of the waiver of condition to prevent injustice.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>21.&nbsp;Was the contract UNCONSCIONABLE?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b>&nbsp;Under contract law an unconscionable contract will not be enforceable because there is NO REASONABLE FINDING OF INTENT to enter into such a contract. An ADHESION CONTRACT is a â€œtake it or leave itâ€ contract that a party is <b>forced to agree</b> to, and it will often be found unenforceable.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>22.&nbsp;Is DURESS a defense?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law only <b>good faith agreements</b> are enforceable. No contract agreement induced by<b> illegal threats </b>is valid. Likewise, agreements induced by <b>deliberate acts to create threats of economic harm</b> are not enforceable.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">You are unlikely to ever see a question that suggests threats of physical harm because the answer is too easy. But remember that a contract creates legal duties to perform so a threat to breach a contract is an illegal threat. Any agreement that results is the result of â€œeconomic duressâ€ and is unenforceable.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>23.

Is ILLEGALITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law, a contract generally cannot be enforced by a party who knowingly entered into it for an<b> illegal purpose</b>.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>26. Is IMPOSSIBILITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law a material condition of every contract is that performance of contract duties must be objectively possible to perform. The inability of a contract party to perform is irrelevant, as long as performance, in general, is possible. But if performance becomes impossible because of events beyond the control of the parties the contract becomes void.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">27. </span><b>Is COMMERCIAL IMPRACTICABILITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">A Court (a judge, in equity) has the authority to declare a contract void if <b>performance by a party</b> would be so <b>financially burdensome</b>, because of events beyond the control of the parties, that it would cause an injustice.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>28. Is FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law, if the parties enter into a contract <b>knowing</b> that the <b>failure of some condition</b> beyond their control will <b>deny one of the parties</b> the <b>benefit of the bargain</b>, that condition is an <b>implied material condition </b>of the contract, the failure of which excuses both parties from the agreement .</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>29. Is MUTUAL MISTAKE a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under PEERLESS when both parties enter into a contract because of a <b>misunderstanding as to a material fact</b>, there is <b>no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€</b> and the contract is <b>void</b> from the beginning.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>30. Is UNILATERAL MISTAKE a defense?</b><br></font>Under contract law, when <b>one party</b> enters into a contract because of a <b>misunderstanding</b> as to a <b>material fact</b> the <b>majority</b> view is that the <b>parties are legally bound</b> to the contract <b>unless</b> the <b>other party knew</b> or should have known of the mistake, and in that case the contract is <b>voidable</b> by the mistaken party. Under a <b>minority</b> view the contract is <b>legally voidable</b> by the <b>mistaken party</b> in any event if they 1) <b>discover the mistake quickly</b> before the other party substantially relies on the contract, 2) give <b>prompt notice</b> of the mistake, and 3) <b>reimburse the other party</b> for any expenses caused by the mistake.</p><hr><p><b>D. Breach</b></p><p><b>31.&nbsp;Was there an ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</b></p><p>(If there is also a WAIVER of the breach, discuss both issues together.)</p><p>Under contract law an anticipatory breach (or anticipatory repudiation) is a <b>CLEAR STATEMENT OR INDICATION</b> that a party <b>WILL NOT PERFORM</b> future contractual duties when they become due. This is a major breach as to those duties, the non-breaching party is EXCUSED from performance of all remaining contractual duties, and the future duties of the breaching party are ACCELERATED to the present.</p><p>If a party has a <b>REASONABLE BASIS</b> to believe the other party may not perform future contractual duties, the party may demand <b>REASONABLE ASSURANCES</b> and <b>REFUSE TO PERFORM</b> until they are provided. Reasonable assurances generally means a <b>financial guarantee </b>or payment into escrow.</p><p> If reasonable assurances are properly demanded and not provided, the <b>failure to respond</b> constitutes an anticipatory breach.<br></p><p><b>32.&nbsp;WAIVER of the breach?</b></p><p>(Discuss if anticipatory breach is ignored by non-breaching party.)</p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under contract law if a non-breaching party lets the breaching party continue performance after a major breach it WAIVES THE BREACH.</p><p>The waiver cannot be revoked, and the non-breaching party is forever ESTOPPED from citing the breach as major and can only cite it as a minor breach.</p><p><b>33.&nbsp;Was there a BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT?</b></p><p>An IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract is that the parties must act in good faith and are bound by an IMPLIED COVENANT that they will <b>act as reasonably necessary to help the other parties enjoy the benefits of the contract</b> and <b>that they will not act in any way to prevent that from occurring</b>.</p><p>A breach of GOOD FAITH or acting in â€œbad faithâ€ means either deceit, concealment or fraud at the time of execution or else the breach of an implied covenant. The mere breach of an express contract promise, even if done deliberately, is not a breach of good faith.</p><p><b>34.&nbsp;BREACH? MAJOR OR MINOR? </b></p><p>(Realize the first party to breach a contract is the breaching party and after that the other party is the non-breaching party no matter what they do later.)</p><p><b>For COMMON LAW say, </b></p><p>Under contract law a BREACH is a failure to perform a contractual duty when it becomes due. A MAJOR BREACH is either an act which deprives the other party of the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN or the violation of an EXPRESS OR IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION by a party, regardless of its effect on the other party. A major breach EXCUSES the non-breaching party from all further performance of contractual duties and ACCELERATES the future contractual duties of the breaching party to the present so the non-breaching party can seek IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES.</p><p><b>For UCC say, </b></p><p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC any shipment of non-conforming goods is a breach of contract. There is no distinction between â€œmajorâ€ and â€œminorâ€ breaches.<br></p><p><b>For UCC DIVISIBLE CONTRACT SITUATION say, </b></p><p>Under the UCC a breach with respect to any shipment of goods under a DIVISIBLE CONTRACT does not constitute a breach of the entire contract. A DIVISIBLE contract is one under which goods are to be delivered in separate shipments which can each be evaluated separately under the contract.</p><p><b>35.&nbsp;EFFECT OF BREACH ON A DIVISIBLE CONTRACT? </b></p><p>Under the UCC a breach with respect to any shipment of goods under a DIVISIBLE CONTRACT does not constitute a breach of the entire contract.

But after a condition has been waived the waiving party has a legal right to retract the waiver. 39 Nevertheless, a Court of EQUITY may estop the retraction based on considerations of equitable estoppel.

Duty?</b></p><p>Generally a person owes no duty to others. But a duty may be based on a <b>Statute</b>, a <b>Contract</b>, a <b>Relationship</b>, the <b>Assumption</b> of a duty, or <b>Peril</b> caused by the defendant.</p><p><b>Negligence Per Se?</b></p><p>If a <b>Statute</b> creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute <b>Negligence Per Se</b> if the purpose of the statute was to protect the <b>Class of People</b> to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent.</p><p>Here D violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused P to suffer injury. But she was not in the <b>Class of People</b> the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people \"on national lands\" and she was \"outside the National Forest boundaries\". Further she did not suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent because it was to \"prevent forest fires and injury\" while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.</p><p>Therefore, P would be unable to prove D was negligent per se.</p><p><b>Duty Based on Peril?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under <b>Palsgraf</b>, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the<b> zone of danger</b> caused by the defendant\'s acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant\'s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.</p><p><b>Definition:</b> Andrews held that if the defendant owes a <b>duty to anyone</b> and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.</p><p>Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because \"no one else was around\" and there was \"nothing that could burn\".</p><p>P appeared to be outside the <b>zone of danger </b>caused by D\'s activities because she was a \"half mile downstream\". P might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the \"gravel bar\" because D should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for P to prove that D had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.</p><p><b>3. Breach?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law a <b>Breach</b> is the failure to exercise <b>Due Care</b>. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances.</p><p>Here D went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone because he went to a \"gravel bar\" in the \"middle of the river\" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers \"carefully\".</p><p>P could only argue that a reasonable observant person would have seen the \"log\" floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than D.</p><p><b>4. Actual Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition:</b> Under tort law an act Actually Causes injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured <b>but for </b>the act.</p><p>Here P would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if D had not thrown the firecracker.</p><p>Therefore, D was the actual cause of P\'s injury.</p><p><b>5. Proximate Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law Proximate cause means that the injury to the plaintiff was <b>foreseeable</b>, <b>close in time and place</b> to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a <b>chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events</b>.</p><p>Generally when there are tow or more actual causes of an injury, <b>the last, unforeseeable intentional act </b>will be an <b>Unforeseeable intervening event </b>that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting of all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are <b>presumed to be unforeseeable</b> absent additional specific facts.</p><p>Here P was rather far away form D in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further, a reasonable person would not foresee that&nbsp; firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if D was the proximate cause of P falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harry\'s criminal act was an <b>unforeseeable intervening event</b>.</p><p>Therefore, P probably could not prove D was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-09-28 01:34:38', 1),

However, through the backyard window, Tom was surprised to see\r\nHeather kissing another man.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Tom felt queasy and left. He went to the drug store and bought Anxiety-Fix, an\r\nover-the-counter anti-anxiety medication that he had never used before, and headed\r\nhome. Tom took three Anxiety-Fix pills, even though the instructions on the box stated\r\nthat a person should take no more than two pills every eight hours. Two hours later, still\r\nfeeling anxious, Tom took four more Anxiety-Fix pills, and fell asleep. Tom awoke in the\r\nmiddle of the night due to a nightmare he had about Heather.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Tom then lit several firecrackers in his yard, and threw them at Heatherâ€™s house. He\r\nwanted to wake her up to discuss what he had seen. Two of the firecrackers landed in\r\nthe toolshed, setting it afire. The sound of the firecrackers awakened Heather and,\r\nupon seeing flames, she grabbed a can of lighter fluid, opened some windows on the\r\nside of the house near the shed, and squirted the flammable fluid on the windowsills.\r\nHeather had been having a hard time selling her house and thought that, as long as the\r\nshed was going to burn down, the house could just as well burn with it since her\r\ninsurance would cover the loss.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Meanwhile, Tom used a garden hose to extinguish the fire in the toolshed before it\r\nspread.

The throwing of firecrackers,\r\nwhich are essentially a flammable and explosive device, should be known to a\r\nreasonable person of being capable of starting a fire. Therefore, the throwing of the\r\nfirecrackers themselves is dangerous, especially when thrown on someone\'s lawn,\r\nwhich may be flammable. Further, T was well aware that there were devices that used\r\ngasoline in H\'s shed, because T had frequently used them. Therefore, not only did T\r\nact recklessly, but he knew that there was even more reason to use caution because\r\nthere was flammable liquid, gasoline, contained in the shed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Therefore, T acted maliciously when throwing the fire crackers.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic\">Dwelling House/Structure\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law, the burning was required to be of a dwelling house.

The tools within the shed did burn, but the structure itself only suffered\r\nsmoke damage. Smoke damage does not constitute a burning because it does not\r\nactually char the building and further, this indicates that the open flame of the fire never\r\nactually touched the shed. Thus, T should be found not guilty of the charge of arson.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The state will argue, however, that the smoke damage is sufficient. Further, the fire\r\nmay have actually burned the floor of the shed, depending on how the shed was built.\r\nHowever, there are no facts that indicate that the shed had a floor to it. Therefore, it is\r\nunlikely that the state would be able to counter T\'s argument that the smoke damage is\r\ninsufficient to show a burning.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Arson is an inherently dangerous felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">However, for argument\'s sake, assuming the court found smoke damage sufficient to\r\nshow a burning, then T would be guilty', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-10-14 01:38:52', 1);

Since the offer did\r\nnot include a specified means of acceptance, the method of acceptance must be\r\nreasonable, and there are no facts that would indicate that a handshake was\r\nunreasonable. Indeed, since both offeror and offeree participated in the handshake,\r\nand offeror made no objection, it would seem that the offeror consented to that method\r\nof acceptance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The offer was accepted by the offeree.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Consideration\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Consideration is bargained-for legal detriment; \"an agreement to do what one needn\'t,\r\nor to refrain from doing what one may.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the facts show that Dealer was going to transfer ownership of the handgun to\r\nBuyer, which she had no obligation to do but for the contract. Likewise, Buyer was to\r\ntransfer money to Dealer, which he had no obligation to do but for the contract. These\r\nobligations arose out of a negotiating, or bargaining, process, and constitute legal\r\ndetriment.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">There was mutual consideration.

First, a request to have the item inspected\r\nbefore purchase may not be sufficiently definite and unequivocal of a manifestation that\r\none intends to fail to perform their duties. Dealer will argue that Buyer\'s statement that\r\nhe \"will not pay ... unless\" Dealer did something he was under no obligation to do is\r\nsufficiently clear as to Dealer\'s intent to breach. Buyer will argue that his statement is\r\nmere grumbling and does not rise to the definiteness required to be an anticipatory\r\nrepudiation. Dealer probably has the better of these arguments. However, it seems\r\nDealer elected to demand assurances rather than treat this as an immediate breach by\r\ntelling Buyer that he \"expect[s]\" the Buyer to go through with the deal. Buyer then\r\nprovided assurance that he would perform, </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic\">before </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">he gave any notice of intent to treat\r\nthe anticipatory repudiation as a breach.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">To the extent that Buyer repudiated the contract, he cured that repudiation with his letter\r\nassuring performance, and Dealer will not be able to escape liability under a theory of\r\nanticipatory repudiation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defense - Mistake\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A mutual mistake is when, at the formation of the contract, the parties are mistaken as\r\nto a fact that goes to the essence of the bargain, and the risk of such a mistake was not\r\nplaced on the parties under the express or implied terms. Such a contract is voidable\r\nby either party.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, it seems that neither party knew the value of the handgun at contract formation.\r\nDealer was originally going to sell it for one tenth of what it should have been, while\r\nBuyer almost backed out of the deal. The mistake in the value of the handgun is\r\ntherefore mutual.

Buyer will argue that the risk of an antique being more or less valuable as a\r\nresult of learning more about the history of that antique is inherent in the transaction and\r\nnot a risk that the parties should not bear. Or, being that Dealer is a merchant, Buyer\r\nmay argue that the risk he created for himself by failing to exercise caution by\r\nresearching before selling, as he should have known to do as a merchant of antiques, is\r\nDealer\'s fault and Dealer\'s to bear. Further, Buyer could argue that Dealer\'s mistake\r\nwas not reasonable, as Dealer could have learned of the issue by doing some basic\r\nInternet searching as he later did.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Due to the nature of antiques and the Dealer\'s failure to research before selling, it is\r\nunlikely Dealer will be able to escape liability under a theory of mutual mistake.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Specific Performance\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Specific performance is an equitable remedy reserved for when money damages are\r\ninsufficient to make a plaintiff whole.

No amount of\r\nmoney can purchase a replacement of it, as the item\'s value is not in the metal the\r\nhandgun contains, nor in the cost to turn metal into a handgun, but in the historical\r\nnature of the item, and history cannot be bought.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The court should grant Buyer\'s request for specific performance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Other Remedy\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If the court refuses to exercise its discretion to issue equitable relief, Buyer may seek\r\nexpectation damages.

The facts suggest that the market value may be $20,000 due to the\r\nlisting price by the dealer and the 10x enhancement of value from the $2,000 original\r\nprice.

Modernly, acts for\r\nconspiracy are limited to crimes, and many jurisdictions require an overt act in\r\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1. The agreement: Here, it appears that we have two agreements: One between Arthur\r\nand Cassie to sell art from the gallery and then sell it, and one between Arthur and\r\nWoody to take and move the wrapped package from the gallery and put in into the\r\nbuilding next door.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a.

The facts\r\ntell us that Arthur and Cassie both \"wanted to make some extra money by selling art\r\nfrom the gallery.â€ Thus, it appears that both\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b.

Arthur paid Woody $500\r\nto take the wrapped package from the gallery, but it is not clear whether Woody knew\r\nthat such an act was intended to help Arthur and Cassie commit any crime. Since\r\nArthur and Cassie were art gallery employees, it may not have been immediately\r\napparent to Woody that they were working to commit any crime. Under majority rules, a\r\nConspiracy requires two guilty minds. Only if Woody shared Arthur and Cassie\'s intent\r\nthat a theft crime be committed, not merely acting as an innocent agent, will there be\r\ntwo guilty minds in this case. Under the Minority Model Penal Code (MPC) rules, one\r\ncan be guilty of a Unilateral Conspiracy with only one guilty mind. In this case, Arthur\r\ncould still be guilty under these facts. It appears likely, therefore, that a conspiracy will\r\nnot be found in these circumstances.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 13\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2.

This act would count under either above noted agreement.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4.

Trespassory Taking and Carrying Away: Arthur took and carried away (asportation)\r\nthe wrapped art when he handed it to Woody. Here, it appears most likely that Arthur, if\r\nhe had any possessory right to art at all, only had mere custody from his employer, the\r\nart gallery, to handle the art. This would make the taking trespassory. It does not\r\nappear that Arthur had any lawful possession of the art, but, if he did, the crime would\r\nbe Embezzlement as noted below.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. Personal Property of Another: The Wrapped Art was clearly the personal property of\r\nthe art gallery and not Arthur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. With the Intent to Permanently Deprive: Arthur had the intent to sell the art later on\r\neBay. Even if the art gallery could get it back later, the high risk that they would not be\r\nable to would still constitute the intent to permanently deprive.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Conclusion: It appears most likely that Arthur will be guilty of Larceny since all of the\r\nelements appear to be established.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">C.

Burglary: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At Common Law, Burglary was the trespassory breaking and entering of\r\nthe dwelling house of another at night with the intent to commit a felony. In Modern\r\njurisdictions, the dwelling house requirement has been expanded to cover all protected\r\nstructures (structures with a roof), the nighttime requirement has been eliminated, and\r\nthe Breaking requirement has been limited in favor of an expansion of the Trespassory\r\nEntry.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1. Trespassory Breaking and Entering: Here, it appears that Arthur waited inside the art\r\ngallery until it closed for the evening. At Common Law, this would not have constituted\r\na trespassory breaking and entering since Arthur appears to have lawfully entered the\r\ngallery when he came to work that day. By remaining inside after closing, however,\r\nArthur may have committed a \"Constructive Breaking\" in many jurisdictions.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Additionally, assuming that Woody is Arthur\'s innocent agent, the acts of Woody can be\r\nimputed to Arthur. Here, Woody climbed through an opening in the roof. Since the roof\r\nwas already open, at Common Law, this could not constitute a breaking. In Modern\r\njurisdictions, the breaking requirement has often been eliminated or severely limited\r\nsuch that a Burglary might still be found here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. Dwelling House of Another: At Common Law, the art gallery could not be considered\r\nthe dwelling house of another. Under Modern Law, this has been expanded to cover all\r\nprotected structures, structures with a roof, so this requirement would be satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. At Night: It appears that this event occurred \"after the gallery had closed for the\r\nevening,\" so most likely the Common Law nighttime requirement (after sundown) would\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 15\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Intent to Commit a Felony: At Common Law, a larceny was a felony, but under\r\nmodern law it is often not. In this situation, however, most modern jurisdictions expand\r\nthe felony requirement to include larceny and other theft crimes, so this requirement\r\ncould still be satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">5. Conclusion: It appears most likely that in a modern jurisdiction, but not in a Common\r\nLaw jurisdiction, a Burglary would be found. Arthur would also vicariously liable for the\r\ncrimes of Cassie in taking the painting directly after Woody did not show up. Depending\r\non the value of the paintings stolen, some jurisdictions would also consider Grand v.\r\nPetty larceny for this crime.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">E. Murder:\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Murder is a homicide committed with Malice.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homicide: A homicide is the killing of another human being.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Causation: Here, it appears that the acts of Arthur may not have directly caused the\r\ndeath of Woody; however, Arthur did set the events in motion that eventually lead to\r\nWoody\'s death and could be liable for his death here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Malice: Malice can be established in any of four ways: 1. Intent to Kill, 2. Intent to Cause\r\nSerious Bodily Injury, 3. Wanton or Willful Conduct., and 4. Felony Murder. Only the\r\nlast two could apply here since there is no evidence of any intent to kill or seriously\r\ninjure on the part of Arthur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. Wanton or Willful Conduct: In order to have Wanton or Willful Conduct, the defendant\r\nmust 1. Create the risk, 2. Know of the Risk, and 3. Consciously disregard the high risk\r\nof serious bodily injury or death resulting from these actions. It is not clearly that Arthur\r\nwas aware of any risk to Woody as a result of his actions in carrying the package across\r\nthe roof to the other building, but it is clear that walking across a roof at night and\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 16\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">crossing between buildings possesses some risk of serious harm. In addition, Arthur\r\ndid not create the gap; however, he could still be said to have created the risk based on\r\nhis agreement with Woody to carry the art. Based on the above, it is also not perfectly\r\nclear whether Arthur could have consciously disregarded any risk he was not aware of;\r\nhowever, if he was aware, he seems to have disregarded it. It appears most likely,\r\ntherefore, that the actions of Arthur rose to the level of Wanton or Willful Conduct.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Felony Murder: The Felony Murder Rule states that one who kills during the\r\ncommission of an inherently dangerous felony is guilty of murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a. Inherently Dangerous Felony: In most jurisdictions and at Common Law, Burglary is\r\nconsidered an inherently dangerous felony. See above for a consideration of whether a\r\nBurglary occurred. No other crime noted could generally satisfy this requirement.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Some jurisdictions also consider the manner in which the crime was committed but even\r\nthere it would be clear that walking across a roof at night and crossing between\r\nbuildings possesses some risk of harm and might still constitute an inherently\r\ndangerous felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b. During the Perpetration: Woody clearly died as he was carrying the art to the other\r\nbuilding, which was during the perpetration of (flight from) the Burglary if the did in fact\r\noccur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Degree: If a Felony Murder was found to have been committed, the Murder would be\r\nFirst-Degree. If only Wanton and Willful Conduct can be established, the Murder will be\r\nsecond-degree.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Conclusion</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">It appears most likely here that a Felony Murder occurred, and Arthur will\r\nbe charged with First-Degree Murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 17\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">F.

Additionally, Cassie will be liable for Larceny/Embezzlement for the\r\ntaking of the paintings in the gallery directly after Woody did not arrive with the\r\npackages. We are also not told how Cassie \"went back into the gallery.\" If such an\r\nentry could constitute a Burglary, especially under Modern Law as noted above, Cassie\r\ncould also be independently liable for Burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">III.

Walter\'s\r\ninitial question is likely not an offer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">However, Betsy\'s reply to Walter\'s inquiry may be considered a valid offer if it is found to\r\ncontain the requisite terms. Her statement \"of course,\" in reply to Walter\'s inquiry likely\r\nindicates a manifestation of present intent to be bound as a clear and unambiguous\r\nstatement. It was made in conversation with Walter, so it is clearly communicated to an\r\nofferee. \"Get down here as soon as possible\" indicates a time for performance (as soon\r\nas possible). \"We can see where you would fit in\" likely indicates the subject matter\r\n(employment at Betsy\'s business). However there are two significant missing terms:\r\nprice and duration.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Modern courts are split on how to treat offers of at-will employment such as this.\r\nFollowing traditional common law rules, Betsy has indicated an intent to contract but\r\nhas not made a fully valid offer, lacking the essential terms of price and duration.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Acceptance\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A valid acceptance is an unambiguous manifestation of assent communicated in a\r\ntimely manner.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The facts state that Walter \"agreed\" to the offer, and further, that he would take\r\nimmediate steps to perform by giving notice at his current job and moving to South City\r\nby the end of the month. This is both an unambiguous statement of assent, and a timely\r\nresponse.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Therefore there is likely a valid acceptance if there has been a valid offer.<br>\r\nConsideration<br>\r\nConsideration is evidence of a bargained-for exchange of legal detriment or legal\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 27\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">benefit.

Depending on how a court views at-will employment promises,\r\nthere may be valid consideration.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Detrimental Reliance - Promissory Estoppel\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">This scenario is a clear case of detrimental reliance, a theory that allows a court to\r\nenforce promises that have not created a valid and legally enforceable contract.\r\nDetrimental reliance requires that i) one makes a promise with the intent to induce\r\nreasonable reliance on the other party, ii) the other party foreseeably and justifiably\r\nrelies on that promise to his detriment, and iii) unenforcement of the promise would\r\ncreate injustice.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The theory of promissory estoppel is often invoked to estop one party from claiming no\r\ncontract exists as an excuse to perform where there has been clear detrimental\r\nreliance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Walter will argue that Betsy\'s specific offer of employment, coupled with her repeated\r\nsuggestions over the years that Walter move to South City and work for her, were\r\npromises made with the intent to reasonably induce reliance. Indeed, it was\r\nforeseeable that Betsy\'s repeated suggestions and clear offer would foreseeably induce\r\nreliance on the part of Walter. Thus this element is met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Walter did in fact reasonably and justifiably rely to his detriment on Betsy\'s promise\r\nwhen he i) gave notice at work, ii) shipped his furniture to South City, iii) spent $5,250\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 28\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">on shipping and plane tickets, and iv) moved to South City. Thus, the element of actual\r\nreliance is met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If a court finds that there was no valid offer made by Betsy to Walter, a theory of\r\ndetrimental reliance can be used to prevent injustice and either enforce the promise as\r\nif a contract existed or provide Walter with reliance damages.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Statute of Frauds\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Certain contracts, including ones that will take over a year to perform, must be\r\ncontained in a signed writing to be enforceable. Since this agreement was for at-will\r\nemployment, which theoretically could be completed at any time if either party decides\r\nto quit or cancel the contract in good faith, this agreement is not covered by the statute\r\nof frauds.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Breach\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A material breach is found where one party has been substantially deprived of the\r\nbenefit of the bargain, has had commercially reasonable expectations frustrated, or has\r\nsuffered significant economic loss as a result of one party\'s failure to perform.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Walter will argue that he has been substantially deprived of the benefit of the bargain\r\nand suffered a loss of reasonable expectations and economic benefit when Betsy\r\nchanged her position and said she could no longer employ him since he took substantial\r\nsteps and made significant expenditures expecting to be hired. Betsy\'s refusal to hire\r\nWalter strikes to the essence of the agreement and therefore will be considered a\r\nmaterial breach if there is a valid and enforceable contract in existence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Excuses to Performance - Unforeseeable Event\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Betsy may argue that her failure to perform is excusable based on unforeseeable\r\nchange in circumstances.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 29\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Commercial Impracticability\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Commercial impracticability requires that circumstances not contemplated or reasonably\r\nforeseeable at the time of contracting have occurred, causing severe economic\r\nhardship to one party.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">As a businessperson, Betsy will likely be held responsible for reasonably foreseeing that\r\nshe might lose a major customer.

However, the current trend is to allow suits between spouses especially\r\nwhen intentional torts are involved. Thus, whether Wanda can sue Homer would\r\nessentially be a jurisdictional issue and a matter of law which the judge would\r\ndetermine. If the judge rules that no, spouses cannot sue in tort, Homer\'s liability will\r\nterminate and the directed verdict will be granted. However, this is unlikely\r\nconsidering the current trends allowing suits between spouses. Here, we will\r\nassume that spouses are allowed to sue each other in tort of both intentional tort and\r\nnegligence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">II. IS HOMER NEGLIGENT?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the question of negligence would relate to the burning of the house and\r\nwhether Homer\'s actions were sufficiently negligent in causing the\r\nburning. Negligence requires the finding of a duty imposed upon the Plaintiff\r\n(Homer), a breach of that duty, causation of the injury and an actual injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1.

A duty of care between husband and\r\nwife, as immediate family, is higher than the duty imposed regarding an average\r\nunrelated citizen. The duty to protect from harm is greater because of the\r\nrelationship between Homer and Wanda. Because the duty to not harm Wanda is\r\ngreater than the reasonable person standard a duty can be assignable to Homer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. DID HOMER BREACH THAT DUTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A breach of duty requires actions be committed by the Plaintiff (Homer) that\r\nplace others in unreasonable danger or heightened risk. Breach can be established\r\nvia statute (negligence per se) where a violation of civil or criminal statute imposes\r\nautomatic fault (which then, if the violation is a civil statute, constitutes a rebuttable\r\npresumption by the Plaintiff). Here, there is no negligence per se because there is\r\nno mention of a statute being violated. Breach can also be established through clear\r\nexplicit facts and/or the definable overt actions of the Plaintiff (Homer). However,\r\nthe facts here are murky. Thus, a third method of determining breach must be\r\nused--the method of res ipsa loquitor.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Res ipsa loquitor allows an inference of breach when clear facts supporting\r\nbreach do not exist. Res ipsa requires that the defendant be in clear control of the\r\ninstrumentality that caused the injury, that the injury would not have occurred without\r\nsome sort of negligence by the defendant, that no possible superseding acts occur\r\nthat would remove the defendant from the chain of control over the instrumentality,\r\nand that the plaintiff (Wanda) not have participated in their own injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 20\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">RES IPSA LOQUITOR AS VEHICLE FOR FINDING BREACH OF DUTY\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a. DID HOMER HAVE CLEAR CONTROL OVER THE FURNACE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the instrumentality that caused the injury (the destruction of the\r\nproperty, the \"house\") appears to be the \"furnace in their home\" that had \"stopped\r\nworking\". It states that Homer \"insist[ed] on attempting to fix it himself\" instead of\r\n\"call[ing] a licensed repair person\". There is no mention of any other person or thing\r\ninteracting with the furnace between the time Homer \"attempt[ed] to fix it himself\"\r\nand the \"burning\" of the house. This means Homer was ostensibly the last person to\r\ninteract with the furnace and a reasonable person could conclude that Homer had a\r\nclear control over the physical object of the \"furnace\" which ostensibly caused the\r\ninjury, \"burning\". This element is most likely met on its face since the \"furnace\" was\r\nwithin the purview of the \"home\" which would be interpreted to be under Homer\'s\r\ncontrol (dominion).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b. WOULD THE INJURY HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT SOME SORT\r\nOF NEGLIGENCE BY THE DEFENDANT?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">This is a more sticky issue than the clear control issue, supra, which\r\nseems to be a straight physical-control-over-the-object question. This element\r\nfocuses more on the interaction the defendant had on the object in question.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">On first glance, it seems that since Homer \"having no knowledge of how\r\nthe furnace worked\" but yet \"attempting to fix it himself\" would infer that his lack of\r\nexperience likely caused improper repair on the furnace which then, according to the\r\nfirefighter at the scene, seemed to be the cause of the fire that \"appeared to have\r\noriginated in the furnace\". It appears on its face that Homer\'s repair led to the\r\nfire. However, could the furnace have posed a fire risk prior to Homer\'s repair\r\nefforts? Perhaps. Did Homer\'s repair in fact actually place the furnace in a condition\r\nthat would cause a fire risk when his attempt at repair would not? This is\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 21\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">unknown. The facts state that \"the furnace in their home stopped working\" but it\r\ndoesn\'t state what stopped working or why. There is also no mention of a defect to\r\nthe furnace prior to repair that would pose a fire risk.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Surface review would appear to assign Homer\'s actions as a direct cause\r\nof the fire. But, the fact that a firefighter (although ostensibly an expert in the field of\r\nfighting fires) making the statement that the fire \"appeared\" to have \"originated in the\r\nfurnace\" is not a direct statement of \"the furnace started the fire because it had been\r\nrepaired incorrectly\". This is probably a matter for an expert witness to determine at\r\ntrial. If Homer\'s actions did not cause the fire because the furnace was already\r\ndamaged and at a fire risk and Homer\'s \"repairs\" did not place that furnace in a\r\nhigher state of unreasonable unsafety then the injury of \"the burning of the house\"\r\nmay not be attributable to Homer\'s act of trying to fix the furnace and negate this\r\nelement of res ipsa loquitor resulting in no negligence. However, if this element is\r\nmet the other elements of negligence must also be met to find liability on the part of\r\nHomer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">c.

Intervening acts are those that occur that are foreseeable\r\nconsequences of defendant\'s acts and do not relieve defendant of\r\nliability. Superseding acts are those that are outside the realm of foreseeability and\r\nwould be those so out of the ordinary that they would relieve the defendant of\r\nliability. Intentional torts and criminal acts are considered superseding.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 22\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, we don\'t know what acts may or may have occurred between the\r\n\"attempt[ed]...fix\" by Homer and the \"home...destroyed by fire\" that may or may not\r\nhave \"originated in the furnace\". As discussed above, the exact cause of the fire is\r\nonly an assumption at this point, not a definitive statement of fact. Further analysis\r\noutside the fact pattern will be needed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">It is to be noted that the acts of the fire department in attempting to stop\r\nthe fire may have contributed to the \"destruction\" of the home. However, acts done\r\nduring attempts to rescue are foreseeable results of a \"fire\" by those public servants\r\ntasked with protecting the public, \"firefighters\". Even if actions by the fire\r\ndepartment are found to be negligent that will not release Homer from any potential\r\nliability since intervening acts of negligence are always considered foreseeable.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">d. DID PLAINTIFF CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OWN INJURY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">It is unlikely Wanda will be considered to have contributed to her own\r\ninjury, the \"destruction\" of the \"house\" by \"fire\". However, she did want to call a\r\n\"licensed repair person\" but was persuaded to let Homer fix the furnace instead\r\ndespite the fact that she (likely) knew Homer had \"no knowledge of how the furnace\r\nworked\". Was this enough to place some responsibility of \"destruction\" of the\r\n\"home\" by \"fire\" on Wanda? Perhaps. Again, additional facts will be needed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Assuming the elements of res ipsa loquitor are met, there will be a finding of\r\nbreach on the part of Homer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3.

WAS THERE AN INJURY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">An injury here would be the destruction of the \"house\" by \"fire\" which\r\nwould constitute property damage and thus qualify as \"injury\" for negligence. Pure\r\neconomic damages are not recoverable but personal injury and property damages\r\ndo qualify as \"injury\" for the purposes of negligence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">DEFENSES TO BREACH\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homer may have several defenses to breach that would negate his liability\r\nand thus allow a directed verdict. The only two potential defenses are comparative\r\nnegligence and assumption of risk. Comparative negligence jurisdictions allow a\r\ncomplete bar to plaintiff recovery if that plaintiff contributed in any manner to their\r\nown injury. As above, assignment of responsibility to Wanda will be necessary to\r\ntrigger comparative negligence and bar her from recovery. A bar to recovery would\r\nallow a directed verdict for Homer regarding the negligence claim. Contributory\r\nnegligence, while a defense more often available in a majority of jurisdictions,\r\nassigns risk to plaintiffs based on their percentage of fault and reduces their\r\nrecovery accordingly. Here, only a finding of fault in excess of 50% on Wanda\'s\r\nbehalf (in Pure Comparative Negligence jurisdictions) or 50% or higher (Modified\r\nComparative Negligence jurisdictions) would bar her from complete\r\nrecovery. Finding Wanda at fault in excess of 50% or 50% or higher is unlikely and\r\nthus comparative negligence in both its forms would only serve to reduce damages\r\nwhich would then prohibit Homer from receiving his directed verdict. Assumption of\r\nthe risk is a defense that states a plaintiff is barred from recovery if they knew of the\r\nrisk and voluntarily assumed it. Here, there is no clear assumption of the risk of\r\n\"destruction of the home by fire\" by Wanda and thus she did not voluntarily assume\r\nit. This is not a defense.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 24\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">III. DID HOMER COMMIT A BATTERY AGAINST WANDA?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Battery is the intentional volitional act of the defendant against the plaintiff\r\ncausing an offensive or harmful touching of the plaintiff\'s body or person (a\r\nconnected object suffices). The reasonable person standard applies when\r\nevaluating what is \"harmful\" or \"offensive\" contact.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the defendant \"Homer\" intentionally and volitionally \"slapped [the plaintiff]\r\n[[Wanda] to calm her down\" which would be considered a harmful and offensive\r\ntouching of the body of \"Wanda\" when evaluated by a reasonable person. There is\r\na battery because Homer intended to touch her and caused a harmful and offensive\r\ntouching.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">DEFENSES TO BATTERY\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homer poses a defense to battery that his intent was \"to calm Wanda down\" and\r\nnot \"cause her alarm\". However, the reason behind the battery is not relevant, only\r\nthe intent to touch and a resulting harmful or offensive contact is needed to establish\r\nbattery. There is no defense to battery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">CONCLUSION: There is likely standing for the parties to sue; negligence on the\r\npart of Homer has not been clearly established with the facts at hand; Homer did\r\ncommit a battery.

(Flowers) built a large greenhouse facility in a rural\r\narea twenty miles outside of the city of Urbania at a cost of $20 million. Flowers\r\nemploys 20 workers. Because many of the plants grown in the greenhouse require\r\nmore light than is naturally available, Flowers installed a system to provide needed light\r\nduring normally dark periods. The light was extremely bright, casting a glow far beyond\r\nFlowersâ€™ property.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Flowers was successful in its business, but became concerned as the suburban area\r\naround Urbania expanded and as houses were built closer and closer to its greenhouse.\r\nFlowers decided to put up signs all around its property warning prospective residents of\r\nthe light created by the business.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry saw Flowersâ€™ signs when he was thinking about buying one of the nearby\r\nresidences, but figured that the light could not be that bad. He subsequently purchased\r\nand moved into an expensive new home, much like all the others in the area, on the\r\nstreet directly facing Flowersâ€™ greenhouse. After having lived there three months, Harry\r\ndecided that he could not tolerate the light coming in his windows 24 hours a day. He\r\nhas asked Flowers to turn off the lights, and Flowers has refused, arguing that its facility\r\nis completely up to industry standards, that there is no way to continue the business\r\nwithout the light, and that Harry knew about the issue when he bought the house.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\r\n						<li style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">\r\n							<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">What tort claims can Harry reasonably bring against Flowers?

There is\r\nextremely bright light streaming into his home \"24 hours a day\" and he asserts that he\r\ncan no longer tolerate it after enduring it for three months. He will claim that it is\r\nunreasonable because the neighborhood has become fairly residential and as a\r\nresidential neighborhood it is not reasonable to have light shining at hours that are\r\nnormally dark and that any reasonable person would be bothered by the intrusion.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry will argue that the extremely bright light interferes with the use and enjoyment of\r\nhis property.

The nuisance is not unreasonable, that the\r\nplaintiff came to the nuisance, and that there are measures that he can take to limit his\r\ndamages such as heavy curtains or shutters.

Nuisance is a type of harm where the D\r\ncauses substantial interference with the P\'s quiet enjoyment of their real property. That\r\nproperty must be in the P\'s possession or immediate right to possession.

The quality of substantial is not\r\nmeasured by D\'s conduct, but by how great the impact would be on a reasonable, not\r\nhypersensitive person. Would a reasonable person find this to be highly objectionable?\r\nHarry will argue that not only are the lights extremely bright and disruptive to the\r\nenjoyment of the property when they are on, but he would point out that their light is\r\n\"coming in his windows 24 hours a day\"!

In a rural area, as such,\r\nthat is an income to 20 people/families who live nearby which means employment for an\r\narea that will less likely have high employment opportunities such as a larger city.\r\nThose 20 jobs are important.

Furthermore, although there is a harm in the\r\nconstancy of the lights, Flowers will show that the lights are bright at the greenhouse,\r\nbut only put out a glow beyond their property. D will make known that they conform to\r\nindustry standards in their operation. P could always shut their curtains at night and\r\navoid the light. There is a value to the community which will likely outweigh the harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Alternatives\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Although, there is a value to the community P will argue that perhaps the company can\r\nmake modifications or adjustments that would allow the social utility, but help to\r\neliminate the harm. P is requesting that the lights be turned off. D could also turn the\r\nlights another direction or create barriers between the greenhouse and the residential\r\nareas of the town to minimize the impact on the P. D should show reasonable efforts to\r\nminimize the harm in order to continue.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">DEFENSES\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Coming to the harm\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Generally, D may argue that P came to the harm if the harm existed before P\r\nencountered it. This is a type of assumption of the risk analysis. Here, Flowers had\r\nbuilt the greenhouse facility in an area appropriate for the factory. They built \"in a rural\r\narea twenty miles outside of the city\". As the town expanded and grew closer, Flowers\r\nthen put up signs to warn \"prospective residents\" of the light created by the business.\r\nGiven the efforts to build away from a town and the warning that Flowers put forth, then\r\nprospective residents, such as Harry who saw the signs, cannot say that he did not\r\nhave knowledge and awareness of the harm. He was warned and chose to voluntarily\r\nencounter the interference anyway.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">P will argue that although he saw the signs he did not fully understand the scope of the\r\nharm.

An injunction is an equitable remedy in which the\r\ncourt orders the D to stop doing something. In this case, P will request that the courts\r\nhave D shut off the lights that are causing the substantial interference. D will again\r\nargue that the lights are pertinent to their operation. Many of the plants grown require\r\nmore light than is naturally available and will not grow without it, which will impact the\r\nbusiness. They meet industry standards and should not be required to shut down or\r\nsuffer impacts to their operation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">D will likely prevail here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Perhaps, alternatives may be sought as mentioned above in which D can help to\r\nremedy the situation by putting up lighting.

It was his\r\nintent to kill Adam. There is also the fact that Steve is a professional assassin. This\r\nmeans that he kills people for a living. He has done it before.

It is true that Adam\r\nresisted and put Steve\'s life at risk. However, because Steve was the initial aggressor\r\nand because his intent was to kill Adam, this defense would not be allowed.

Here Will certainly\r\nhad knowledge of Adam\'s murder because he requested Steve to do it. He also had to\r\neither solicit or assist in the target crime. Here Will solicited. He gave Steve the idea in\r\nthe first place. Lastly, some courts require intent that the target crime be accomplished,\r\nindicated often by a corrupt stake in the venture. In this case, Will initially had the intent\r\nbecause he asked Steve to do it. Also he had a corrupt goal, to put a business\r\ncompetitor out of business. At least at the moment of solicitation, Will had the\r\nknowledge of the target crime and the intent that it would be accomplished.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Merger--solicitation merges with either the attempt, the commission of the target crime\r\nor with conspiracy. In this case, Will will be found to be an accomplice, thus liable for\r\nthe target crime which was successfully accomplished. He will also likely be found\r\nliable for conspiracy (infra). So solicitation in his case merges.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Conspiracy--see definition supra--Will agreed with Steve that Steve would kill Adam. A\r\nmodern court may look for some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.

The murder of Adam\r\nwas the clear and unique goal of the conspiracy, therefore, Will will be found liable for\r\nthe first-degree murder of Adam, unless he has some valid defense.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 27\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defenses:\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Withdrawal\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Will would argue that he withdrew from the conspiracy before the actual target crime\r\nwas attempted and accomplished. In order for a withdrawal to be valid and to excuse a\r\ncoconspirator from the future crimes of the conspiracy, it is necessary that, one, the\r\ncoconspirator notify the other conspirators of their withdrawal. In this case, Will notified\r\nSteve. He said that he had changed his mind and that he no longer wanted Steve to kill\r\nAdam. However, in addition most courts will require that the defendant have thwarted\r\nthe success of the conspiracy in circumstances indicating a complete and voluntary\r\nwithdrawal from the criminal purpose. In other words, Will would have had to either\r\nsomehow stop Steve himself, or notify the legal authorities so that Steve would be\r\nstopped from killing Adam.

ALMA\'SCRIMES<br>\r\nAlma\'s Solicitation of Burglary, or In the Alternative Larceny, and Extortion, Merges with\r\nthe Target Crimes.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Solicitation is the act of requesting, demanding, or encouraging the commission of a\r\nspecific crime not already planned by another, whether they agree or not. If the target\r\ncrime is committed, it merges with that charge. Actual and proximate causation must be\r\nmet.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Alma \"asked her friend, Bob, a locksmith, to open a locked drawer in Ed\'s desk\" in\r\nEd\'s office for purposes of stealing confidential documents to use for her planned\r\nextortion. Causation is met because had she not requested Bob\'s help, the solicitation\r\nwould not have occurred. Alma is guilty of solicitation, but because the target crimes\r\nwere committed, it merges, and she will not be charged with solicitation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma\'s Conspiracy to Commit Burglary, or In the Alternative Larceny, and Extortion,\r\nDoes not Merge with the Target Crimes.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Conspiracy is the act of agreeing with one or more other people to commit a specific\r\ncrime or series of crimes with the intent to make such agreement where at least one\r\nparty believes there is an agreement (in most jurisdictions) and a co-conspirator has\r\nmade an overt act, including minor preparation, in furtherance of the conspiracy (again\r\nin most jurisdictions).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Bob agreed with Alma to break into Ed\'s drawer for Alma\'s extortion purposes when he\r\n\"said he would help her\"; Alma intended to make an agreement to commit a crime, did\r\nmake such agreement, and her actions when she took Bob to Ed\'s office meet the overt\r\nact and show she believed there was such agreement. Causation is met because she\r\nwould not have entered the agreement had she not asked Bob for help in the\r\ncommission of a crime. Alma is guilty of conspiracy.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 31\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma May be Guilty of Burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Burglary at common law was the breaking and entering of the dwelling of another at\r\nnight with intent to commit a felony. Today it is the entering of any structure of another\r\nwithout license with intent to commit a crime at any time of day, whether breaking or\r\nnot, in most jurisdictions. Both actual and proximate causation must be met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Alma and Bob entered Ed\'s office, a structure, without license, with the intent to\r\nsteal confidential documents, a crime. Causation is met because the entering of Ed\'s\r\noffice with such intent would not have occurred but for Alma taking Bob there, and the\r\nresult is not too remote or accidental, meeting both actual and proximate causation (as\r\ndefined by the MPC).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma May be Guilty of Larceny, a Lesser Included Offense of Burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Larceny is the taking away by trespass of the personal property of another with intent to\r\npermanently deprive them of possession. Actual and proximate causation must be met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If not all the elements of Burglary are met, Alma may be charged with larceny, because\r\nshe and Bob removed the documents from Bob\'s desk. This analysis may be\r\nnecessary because Ed is Alma\'s employer, so entering his office may not have qualified\r\nfor burglary, if she had license to do so. Causation for larceny is met because the\r\ndocuments would not have been taken had Alma not asked Bob to help her take them\r\nand brought him to the scene where they were then taken. However, she certainly did\r\nnot have license to do so for the purpose of stealing documents, so the license should\r\nnot be recognized, and burglary most likely will be charged.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 32\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma May be Guilty of Attempted Extortion.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Extortion is a modern crime where possession or title of personal property or money is\r\ntransferred to the defendant by means of threat. Here, Alma intends to use the\r\nconfidential documents to threaten Ed with embarrassment, resulting in him paying her\r\nmoney. It is irrelevant that she believes he owes her overtime pay because she is still\r\nguilty of the attempt to extort payment by threat of embarrassment. Causation is met\r\nbecause she would not have taken the substantial step toward threatening Ed with\r\nembarrassment to get him to give her money if she hadn\'t entered his office with the\r\nintent to steal the documents for this purpose.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma is Guilty of Felony Murder if She is Guilty of Burglary, Because Diane\'s Death is\r\nForeseeable.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homicide is the act or omission resulting in the death of another human.

Intent is either the conscious desire to bring\r\nabout the result or the substantial certainty that such a result will occur. Here, Abe,\r\nwhile holding his saw in front of him, took two steps towards Bill. Abe may have simply\r\nbeen proceeding with his plan to cut down the tree, and may not have had any intention\r\nwhatsoever to cause Bill any apprehension. However, because this was a\r\nconfrontational situation, a reasonable person would have had the substantial certainty\r\nthat his act would cause such apprehension in Bill; therefore the intent element is\r\nsatisfied. Bill took steps to avoid Abe, which shows that he likely felt apprehension\r\nbecause of Abe\'s act, and this would be reasonable under the circumstances as this\r\nwas a confrontational situation.

One method to determine if a duty is breached is to\r\ncompare the burden to avoid the harm and the utility of the defendant\'s conduct against\r\nthe gravity of harm combined with the likelihood of the harm. Here, Abe\'s burden to\r\navoid any harm was rather low, since all he needed to do was not cut down the tree.\r\nAdditionally, Abe may have been able to simply contact the local municipality and have\r\nthem address his problem with the tree. The utility of Abe\'s conduct is also rather low,\r\nsince his only benefit was the relief from having to rake leaves. The gravity of the harm\r\nsuffered by Cindy was great as she suffered serious injury. The likelihood of Cindy\r\nsuffering such injury was also relatively high, since Abe knew that Bill was in the tree\r\nand was likely to be injured, which would prompt a passerby to assist Bill. Based on this\r\nanalysis, Abe breached his duty of reasonable care to Cindy, since the gravity of harm\r\nand the likelihood of harm greatly outweigh the burden to avoid the harm and the utility\r\nof Abe\'s conduct.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">17\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 19\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Causation-- In order to be liable for negligence, the defendant must be both the actual\r\ncause and proximate cause of the harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Actual cause-- one test used to determine actual cause is the but for test; but for Abe\'s\r\ncutting down the tree, would Cindy have been injured? Clearly the answer is no, so\r\nunder this test Abe is an actual cause of harm. Another test used to determine actual\r\ncause is the substantial factor test; was Abe a substantial factor in Cindy\'s harm? Again\r\nthe answer is clear; Abe was a substantial factor in Cindy\'s harm. Under either test, Abe\r\nis an actual cause of harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Proximate cause-- Were there any intervening acts which caused Cindy\'s harm? Abe\r\nmay contend that the car which struck Cindy was an intervening act, but this act was\r\nforeseeable since the tree was caused to fall into the street. Therefore, this intervening\r\nact would not cut off liability. Next we ask, was the harm suffered by Cindy foreseeable</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">â€¢\r\n</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Since the tree had fallen in the street, and since Bill was in the tree when it was cut\r\ndown, it was entirely foreseeable that a passerby would stop to render aid to Bill. It is\r\nalso foreseeable that Cindy would suffer both the type of injury suffered and the extent\r\nof the injury. Therefore, Abe is a proximate cause of Cindy\'s harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Damages-- Cindy suffered serious injuries, so this element is obviously satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defenses--<br>\r\nAssumption of the risk occurs when the plaintiff knows of the danger involved and\r\nvoluntarily proceeds anyway.

Cindy can claim that she acted perfectly reasonable under the\r\ncircumstances, because there was an emergency situation. Under emergency\r\nsituations, the actor is to act reasonably under the circumstances at hand, even if in\r\nhindsight it is shown that they did not take the wisest course of action.

In response, Foreman shut down the work site.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Foreman stepped away from the work site to call his wife. Just then Stephen, who was\r\nPatricia\'s ten-year-old son, came home from school and climbed into the excavated\r\nhole. As he reached the bottom, he screamed as soil caved in around him and he was\r\nburied. Hearing the scream, Foreman grabbed a shovel, jumped into the hole, freed\r\nStephen after several minutes of shoveling, found that his heart had stopped, and\r\napplied chest compressions to resuscitate him.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Stephen suffered a sprained ankle as a result of the cave-in and broken ribs as a result\r\nof the chest compressions.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1.

Here, in order for Patricia to bring a reasonable\r\nsuit against Contractor she must be able to show that Foreman was an employee of\r\nContractor and that Foreman was negligent.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">In this case, Foreman worked for Contractor. There are no facts to indicate that\r\nForeman was an independent contractor. Contractor left him in charge of the\r\nconstruction site which included the authority to shut down the work site and make other\r\ndecisions in regards to the work being performed. As such, Foreman would be\r\nconsidered an employee of Contractor. If Patricia can assert that Foreman was\r\nnegligent, as discussed below, she will be able to assert a claim against Contractor for\r\nvicarious liability for the damages suffered by Stephen and recover from Contractor.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">B. Negligence. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Patricia can also assert a direct claim against Contractor for negligence.\r\nWhen one takes an affirmative act and fails to act as a reasonable person and a harm\r\nresults they can be held liable as being negligent. In order to assert her claim she must\r\nshow that there was a duty, that duty was breached, the harm caused was a result of\r\nthe breach, damages were suffered and there are no defenses.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">1. Duty</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">. When one takes an affirmative act they owe a duty of reasonable care to all\r\nforeseeable plaintiffs.

Under the majority\r\nview it is held that a duty of reasonable care is owed to all plaintiffs in the foreseeable\r\nzone of danger. Contractor may argue that Stephen was not in the foreseeable zone of\r\ndanger; however, even though he was at school the excavation was occurring at his\r\nhouse, and as such it is foreseeable that he would be present at some time during the\r\nconstruction as construction of a room addition cannot occur within one day of\r\nbeginning to completion. Therefore, Stephen would have been in the foreseeable zone\r\nof danger and was owed a duty of reasonable care. Under the minority view a duty is\r\nowed to all. Under either view, Contractor by beginning the construction owed a duty of\r\ncare to Stephen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">2. Breach of Duty. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When one owes a duty of care, the breach of such duty must be\r\nshown in order to show that there was negligence. Here, there are two theories under\r\nwhich Patricia can try to establish that Contractor breached his duty.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">a. Negligence per se </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">- When there is a statute in place, that statute can be used to set\r\nthe duty and if that statute is not followed can be used to show that the duty was\r\nbreached. In order to show this Patricia must show that the statute was in place to\r\nprevent the type of harm that was suffered, and that the plaintiff was in the class of\r\npeople the statute was designed to protect.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, that standard was intended to protect workers from cave-ins. Since the statute\r\nwas in place to protect from cave-ins, which is what occurred, it was specifically\r\ninstituted to protect from this type of harm. However, it was specifically put into place to\r\nprotect workers, which is the class of plaintiff it is designed to protect. Since Stephen\r\nwas her son, he is not a worker, he is not in the type of class of people the statute was\r\ndesigned to protect; therefore Patricia would be unable to prove breach through the use\r\nof the statute.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">6\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 7\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">b. Reasonable standard. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When one is shown to have acted unreasonably then they\r\nhave breached their duty. Unreasonableness can be shown when the burden of\r\navoiding the harm causing activity paired with the social utility of that activity is less than\r\nthe likelihood that the harm will occur and the gravity of the harm suffered.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor left his employee, Foreman, in charge of the excavation. However, his\r\nduty was to ensure that his plans were such that did not pose a risk to either his\r\nemployees or the people that may be nearby the construction site. Being a contractor,\r\nhe should be knowledgeable to the statutes within the area and adjust his plans\r\naccordingly. As such, since it would take Contractor very little to be knowledgeable of\r\nthe accepted practices within the industry, as he has been in this industry, he owed a\r\nduty of care and reasonable conduct to ensure that his construction sites were safe,\r\nespecially since he left other employees in charge of the sites. If he can show that\r\nForeman acted outside of his scope and therefore did not comply with his instructions\r\nthen he can show that he did not act unreasonably and there was no breach of duty.\r\nHowever, if it is found that Contractor should have known of the risk and did not instill\r\npractices to prevent harm, such as here, setting up an excavation that is clearly against\r\nstatute, then he acted unreasonably and breached his duty of care.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">c. Causation</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">. In order for there to be an appropriate cause of action Patricia must show\r\nthat Contractor\'s breach of duty was both the cause-in-fact of Stephen\'s injuries and the\r\nproximate cause.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">i. Cause-in-fact can be shown here through the but-for test.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, but for the Contractor failing to comply with statute and conduct a reasonable\r\nexcavation that was safe, the hole would not have been in the yard and Stephen would\r\nnot have been able to climb into it and the cave-in would not have occurred.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">ii. Proximate cause. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When there is a foreseeable, intervening and superseding event\r\nthat breaks the chain of causation then the person will not be liable for the harm that\r\nwas caused.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">7\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 8\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor will argue that there was. It is apparent that there was an intervening\r\nsuperseding event; when Foreman shut down the excavation, he left the hole\r\nunattended. This occurred after Contractor\'s breach of duty, which was the improper\r\nexcavation site. However, the question is whether or not this was a foreseeable event\r\nthat occurred. Normally a person will not be held liable for the tortious acts of a third\r\nperson; however, negligence on the part of another person is foreseeable. Therefore, if\r\nit can be shown that Foreman was negligent, as discussed below, then Contractor will\r\nnot be able to argue that he was not the proximate cause of the injury and Patricia will\r\nbe able to prove this element.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">d. Damages. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Damages must be proven in order to be able to recover in a negligence\r\naction. Damages must be legally cognizable. Here, Patricia will be able to meet this\r\nburden since she will be able to show that Stephen suffered a sprained ankle and\r\nbroken ribs.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">e. Defenses. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Under the common law, if a party was contributorily negligent they were\r\nbarred from any recovery. However under the modern majority the theory of\r\ncomparative negligence will be applied and the plaintiff\'s recovery will be reduced by the\r\npercentage of their fault. Depending on the jurisdiction, it will depend on whether they\r\nwill receive recovery no matter the percentage of their fault or if they will be barred if\r\nthey are determined to be more at fault than the defendant.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor will assert that Stephen was negligent when he decided to climb into\r\nan excavated home in a construction area since it is unreasonable to do so. However,\r\nPatricia can assert that Stephen should be held to the standard of a child and not an\r\nadult, so he should be judged as a child of like age, experience and education and as a\r\n10-year old, he was not aware of the risk associated with the hole. A 10-year old boy\r\nnormally enjoys digging holes, climbing into them and exploring. As such, if he is judged\r\non the child standard, he will not be determined to have been negligent and Patricia will\r\nbe able to recover no matter the jurisdiction.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">8\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">II.

Breach. supra\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Foreman had shut down the work site; however he had stepped away from the\r\nwork site to make a phone call to his wife when the injury occurred. Foreman will assert\r\nthat no one was home when he stepped away from the work site to make the call,\r\ntherefore there was no likelihood that any harm would occur and he was not\r\nunreasonable just to be able to make a call since Stephen had just come home from\r\nschool. However, since he was aware by the statute that the excavation site could cave\r\nin which could result in serious harm or death, when he left it unattended, it was\r\npossible for someone he was unaware of to enter the hole, as what happened here\r\nwhen Stephen entered the hole. He could have merely made his phone call by the site,\r\nor left it attended by someone or placed a barrier or warning up to stop people from\r\nentering the whole. This would have required very little effort on his part, and by the use\r\nof a barrier or warning or being present he could have easily prevented Stephen from\r\nentering the hole.

The elements of breaking and entry was satisfied when Ann broke a window in\r\nthe back door and entered the building. The building she entered was a dwelling\r\n(house) and it was not hers, it was possessed by Victor, therefore satisfying the third\r\nand fourth elements. It is stated that this occurred at night, satisfying the fifth element,\r\nand so all that is remaining is that she entered to commit a felony, in this case robbery\r\n(see below). Therefore, she can reasonably be charged with burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Modern statutory changes to burglary often remove the requirement of breaking,\r\nexpand the types of buildings that it applies to, and no longer requires that the offense\r\noccurs at night. However, since this merely expands potential liability, the fact that all\r\nthe common law elements are met means that she would still be liable regardless of\r\nwhether the jurisdiction where this incident occurred had adopted modern changes or\r\nnot. Burglary is a felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(B) Robbery / Attempted Robbery / Aggravated Robbery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Robbery, at common law, required the following elements: (1) obtaining possession; (2)\r\nof personal property; (3) by way of intimidation or force; (4) from another\'s person or\r\npresence; (5) with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. Ann obtained possession\r\nof $500 from Victor\'s home, satisfying the first two elements. While she attempted to\r\nuse intimidation, she eventually succeeded by way of force, satisfying the third element.\r\nVictor was certainly alive at the start of the robbery, and regardless of whether he\r\ntechnically died before or after he died should make little difference because it appears\r\nto all have been in a matter of minutes. Considering that he died from her force and she\r\nimmediately took the $500, the fourth element should be met. She did not intend to\r\nreturn the $500, so the prosecution can contend that she intended to permanently\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">20\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 21\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">deprive him, therefore meeting the fifth element. Therefore she can reasonably be\r\ncharged with robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">In the event that she claims self-defense with regard to the actual shooting and that she\r\ndid not use force to obtain the money (and the intimidation did not accomplish obtaining\r\nthe money either) she could be charged with attempted robbery, because she intended\r\nto use intimidation to obtain the money.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Some jurisdictions have the crime of aggravated robbery which includes robbery with a\r\ndeadly weapon. If this jurisdiction is such, Ann would be charged with aggravated\r\nrobbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(C) First Degree Felony Murder / Homicide\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice\r\naforethought. When a killing occurs during the commission of a felony implied malice\r\nwill be found and the defendant can be charged with felony murder. One requirement is\r\nthat the death must be a foreseeable result of the commission of the felony. A death\r\nthat occurs in the course of a robbery will be found to be foreseeable, especially when\r\nthe defendant uses a deadly weapon to accomplish the robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law there were only a small number of enumerated felonies, any of which\r\ncould serve for felony murder. Modern jurisdictions have many more felonies than at\r\ncommon law and only certain felonies will result in first-degree felony murder (others will\r\nresult in second-degree felony murder). Jurisdictions following the Model Penal Code\r\ninclude kidnapping, robbery, burglary, arson, and rape. If the jurisdiction in which this\r\noccurred follows modern changes Ann could reasonably be charged with first-degree\r\nfelony murder. Regardless she can be reasonably charged with murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann might also be charged with some other form of homicide. She may be charged with\r\nmurder, depending on who pulled the trigger. It is unclear how the trigger went off in the\r\n\"ensuing struggle\" but if she pulled the trigger she may be charged with murder.

Ann struck a bicyclist while\r\nspeeding away from Victor\'s house. It is unclear whether this collision was accidental or\r\nintentional. If it was intentional, then all the elements are met--unlawful physical force\r\nwas applied to the bicyclist resulting in harm while accompanied with the necessary\r\nmens rea of general intent. Even if the contact was accidental, it may be found to have\r\nbeen unlawful because Ann was fleeing from the scene of a felony (assuming one was\r\ncommitted) and had not yet reached a place of temporary safety.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(E) Larceny\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law the elements of larceny are: (1) a taking; (2) and carrying away\r\n(asportation); (3) of property; (4) of another; (5) with intent to permanently deprive them\r\nof it. Larceny could be charged against Ann in the event that Victor\'s death prevents the\r\ncharge of robbery. If robbery cannot be charged, then Ann committed larceny when she\r\ntook the $500 from his house and carried it away with the intent to permanently keep it\r\nfor herself. Even if this property no longer belonged to Victor because he was dead, it\r\ndid belong to someone else (next of kin) and did not, according to the prosecution,\r\nbelong to Ann. Note however, that Ann cannot be convicted of both robbery and\r\nlarceny, as that would be double jeopardy. She can reasonably be charged with both,\r\nbut the jury can only find her guilty of one at most.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(F) Merger\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law, misdemeanors committed in the same act as a felony merged into the\r\nfelony. Depending on how the situation is viewed, it</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">â€™s possible the battery could merge\r\nwith one of the other felonies.

However, when a\r\nperson is convicted of felony murder, the underlying felony merges with the felony\r\nmurder. Therefore, if Ann is convicted of felony murder, the underlying felony (burglary,\r\nrobbery) will merge with it and she can only be convicted of the felony murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Additionally, a lesser included offense merges with a greater offense. If Ann were\r\nconvicted of felony murder she could not also be convicted of another form of criminal\r\nhomicide. If she is convicted of aggravated robbery she cannot also be convicted of\r\nrobbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(2) Ann\'s Defenses\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(A) Defense to Burglary\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann\'s best defense to burglary is that she did not intend to commit a felony in the house\r\nof Victor. Burglary is a specific intent crime which means that Ann must have held the\r\nspecific intention to commit a felony in his home when it was combined with her act of\r\nbreaking and entry. Ann will argue that because the $500 rightfully was hers, she was\r\nnot breaking in to commit robbery. Regardless of whether she did or did not commit\r\nrobbery, she did not believe she was committing robbery, and therefore she did not\r\nhave the requisite intent when breaking into the house.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(B) Defense to Robbery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann\'s first defense to robbery is similar to her defense for burglary. She will argue that\r\nbecause the $500 rightfully belonged to her, she had no intention to permanently\r\ndispossess Victor of any of his property. This is difficult though, because what she was\r\nseeking to reclaim, money, is fungible. She had no way of knowing that the $500 she\r\ntook was her $500. Courts will generally disallow a defense for recovery of fungible\r\nitems. However, she still will argue that she lacked the intent to permanently deprive\r\nhim. Because she did not intend to permanently deprive him, she may be able to negate\r\nthe intent element of robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">23\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 24\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(C) Defense to First Degree Felony Murder / Homicide\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Her best defense to felony murder is that she did not commit the underlying felony of\r\nburglary or robbery. With regard to another form of homicide that she could be charged\r\nwith, her best defense is that she was justified in acting in self-defense. While she was\r\nthe initial aggressor, she is able to regain her right to self-defense if the other party\r\nsuddenly escalates the confrontation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If Victor had pulled out his own gun and she had shot him first, she probably would not\r\nbe able to claim self-defense. However, because Victor disarmed her and turned her\r\nown gun at her while stating an intent to kill her, she was justified in using self-defense.\r\nVictor was only allowed to use necessary force in his own self-defense and shooting her\r\nonce she no longer posed a threat went beyond that. By stating that he was going to\r\nshoot her, while having the apparent ability to do so (point the gun), that allowed Ann to\r\nregain her right of self-defense and to attempt to take the gun back in order to preserve\r\nher own life.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(D) Defense to Battery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Her best defense to battery is that she lacked the necessary intent. Battery requires\r\ngeneral intent which is that the actor knew that they were acting in the proscribed way\r\nand was aware of all attendant circumstances. She was aware she was speeding, but\r\nwas probably unaware of the bicyclist until it was too late to avoid her. Speeding could\r\nbe viewed as negligent or reckless. If it is viewed as recklessness, it must represent a\r\ngross deviation of a risk that a similarly situated person would take given the purpose of\r\ntheir conduct. Her purpose--fleeing the scene--would not be an acceptable purpose.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If it is viewed as negligent, it must be criminally negligent which requires a higher\r\ndegree of fault than criminal negligence. Her ignorance of the risk must have been a\r\ngross deviation from what a normal person in her position would realize. Since many\r\npeople speed, it could be argued that this is not a gross deviation, and fails to rise to the\r\nlevel of criminal negligence or criminal recklessness.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">24\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 25\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">State v.

When\r\nVictor refused to let her inside the house, she broke a window in the back door and let\r\nherself in. This is sufficient to constitute a breaking and entering by Ann. Also, the facts\r\nindicate that the home belonged to Victor; therefore, it was the dwelling of another,\r\nAdditionally, the incident occurred at a time when Ann drove to Victor\'s house in the\r\nnighttime; thus the nighttime requirement is satisfied. Furthermore, prior to Ann arriving\r\nat Victor\'s home, Ann formulated the plan to drive to Victor\'s house with a pistol in order\r\nto scare him into paying her $500.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">However, Ann will argue that because Victor owed her $500, she was simply trying to\r\nrecover what was hers to begin with.

This letter is a communication\r\nthat was sent out, so it is an outward manifestation. Further, Chip said that they \"will\"\r\nbuy the parts from the first manufacturer to commit to the performing according to the\r\nterms. \"Will\" is not equivocal language, it shows that Chip is serious about entering a\r\ncontract with the first to commit to the terms. Further, Chip\'s statement of the specific\r\nterms shows that it is giving the recipients the power to accept because they know what\r\nwill be expected of them - this is not an invitation to negotiate, but an offer to contract.\r\nAs such, this element is met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, re (b), the UCC only requires that the offer contain the quantity term.
