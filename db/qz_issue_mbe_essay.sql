Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is the\r\nfailure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same\r\ncircumstances. To establish a prima facie case Paula must generally prove DUTY, BREACH,\r\nACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSATION and DAMAGES.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">1) DUTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Generally a person owes no duty to others.

But she was not in the CLASS OF PEOPLE the statute was intended to protect\r\nbecause it was to protect people â€œon national landsâ€ and she was â€œoutside the National Forest\r\nboundariesâ€. Further, she did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent\r\nbecause it was to â€œprevent forest fires and injuryâ€ while her injury was getting wet and having her\r\nmoney stolen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Paula would be unable to prove Tom was negligent per se.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">DUTY BASED ON PERIL?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the zone of danger\r\ncaused by the defendant\'s acts.

And once there he threw the firecrackers â€œcarefullyâ€.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Paula could only argue that a reasonably observant person would have seen the â€œlogâ€ floating\r\ndown the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any\r\nmore careful than Tom.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">3) ACTUAL CAUSE of injury to Paula?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law an act ACTUALLY CAUSES injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured but\r\nfor the act.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if Tom had not thrown the\r\nfirecracker.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom was the actual cause of Paula\'s injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">4) PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury to Paula?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable, close\r\nin time and place to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a chain of causation unbroken\r\nby unforeseeable intervening events.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Generally when there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the last, unforeseeable,\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">intentional act will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole\r\nproximate cause, cutting off all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and\r\nintentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent additional specific facts.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula was rather far away from Tom in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she\r\ncould be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further a reasonable person could not foresee\r\nthat a firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if Tom was the proximate cause\r\nof Paula falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because\r\nHarryâ€™s criminal act was an unforeseeable intervening event.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;TimesNewRoman,Italic&quot;; font-size: 12pt;\">Therefore, Paula probably could not prove Tom was the proximate cause of her fall into the river,\r\nand she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</span></p><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 74\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">5) DAMAGES?\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and\r\nsuffering).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula had SPECIAL damages because she lost \"two dollars\" and she had GENERAL\r\ndamages because she was \"hurt and upset.\" But she got out of the river â€œlaughinglyâ€ and was not\r\nâ€œhurt and upsetâ€ until after she discovered the purse was stolen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore Paula suffered actual damages, but Tom was not the cause of those damages.\r\n6) CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was\r\nresponsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY\r\napproach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiffâ€™s recovery based on\r\nthe degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own\r\ninjuries is completely barred from recovery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">NEGLIGENCE PER SE is defined above. Tom might argue Paula was NEGLIGENT PER SE\r\nbecause she was fishing on the bridge where that is prohibited by statute. But Paula did not suffer\r\nthe TYPE OF INJURY the statute was to prevent/ The purpose of the statute was â€œtraffic safetyâ€\r\nand she was not injured in a traffic accident.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore any â€œnegligence per seâ€ argument by Tom would fail.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Tomâ€™s better argument is that Paula was contributorily (comparatively) negligent because she sat\r\nâ€œcarelesslyâ€ and that placed her in PERIL of falling.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, Tom could easily prove Paula was â€œcarelessâ€ and partly responsible for her own\r\ninjury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">7) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?<br>\r\nUnder tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete defense when plaintiffs 1) put\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">themselves at risk, 2) with a full awareness of the risks, and 3) a conscious acceptance of the risks.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here Paula put herself at risk because she â€œsat carelesslyâ€. She had a full awareness of the risks\r\nthat she could fall. And she appears to have consciously accepted those risks because the river\r\nwas only a few â€œfeetâ€ below her, â€œshe could swimâ€ and it was a â€œnice dayâ€.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore Tom may be able to prove assumption of the risks.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n		\r\n	\r\n	\r\n		<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 75\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">PAULA V.

The County would argue that the\r\nnoise was insufficient interference to prevent Ken from enjoying his land because Ken \"didn\'t\r\nthink the noise was so bad\" when he bought the house. He in effect CAME TO THE NUISANCE,\r\nand that fact suggests the situation was not as bad as Ken claims.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">But Ken would try to prove that the interference was unreasonable because the County let flights\r\nincrease â€œten percent\" in only \"four years.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">The County would also argue it did not cause the nuisance, and had not acted irresponsibly. The\r\nCounty might argue it was not responsible because the increase in noise was caused by \"military\r\nuse\" beyond their control. Alternatively, the County would argue that it acted reasonably because\r\nthe flights were in response to the \"Romaria crisis.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Ken would argue he suffered damages because the value of his home was less that it otherwise\r\nwould be. But the County would argue there was no proof of financial loss because the home had\r\ngone up in value and the claim of loss was speculative. Further, the County would argue there was\r\nno proof the birds did not sing as much as before.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore, the County might be liable for private nuisance depending on whether Ken could prove\r\nthese legal elements.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">2) PUBLIC NUISANCE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Under tort law PUBLIC NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff\'s use and\r\nenjoyment of public resources causing her particular injury that is different or greater than the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here the noise interferes with the enjoyment of public land because it prevents Ken from \"hearing\r\nthe birds sing\" on the \"public river parkway.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">The County may argue that Ken lacks standing because he does not suffer any injury that is\r\ndifferent from any other member of the public.

If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive\r\nrelief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy,\r\nand the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the\r\ninterests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive\r\nrelief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property\r\nvalue caused by the nuisance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Here the nuisance is a permanent condition, so the Court would consider injunctive relief. But the\r\ninterest of third parties, people who use the airport, the military, and the County residents would\r\nbe so significant the Court is unlikely to issue an injunction stopping the airport from continuing\r\noperations.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Italic\'\">Therefore the Court would most likely award Ken money damages to reflect the loss of market\r\nvalue of his property caused by the increase in airport traffic.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman\'\">[</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman,Bold\'\">ANSWER EXPLANATION: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'TimesNewRoman\'\">This question is roughly based on true events.

Sam counterclaimed against Windco for damages resulting from the delayed installation and unmerchantable quality of the windows.</p><p>How should the court rule on Windcoâ€™s and Samâ€™s actions? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>Answer A to Question 1</p><p>1. Windco v. Sam â€“ Full Price</p><p>Windco is suing on the contract (K) and must first show that all enforceable K was formed, i.e., mutual assent, consideration &amp; no defenses to K formation.</p><p>A. Mutual assent. 1. Offer.</p><p>a. Advertisement. An advertisement is generally not an offer absent an identified group of offerees to which the ad is communicated, quantity &amp; subject matter. Here, the ad is likely not the offer.</p><p>2. Samâ€™s writing. An offer is a manifestation of present interest to be bound to sufficiently definite essential terms. Samâ€™s writing contained quantity (30), subject matter (window frames), price ($100 each) and his identity. His note to have installation within 15 days manifested his intent to be bound. This was an offer.</p><p>2. Acceptance.</p><p>a. Governing law. Acceptance and terms included turn on governing law. Here 85%, or the main purpose of the K, involved the sale of goods. Goods are moveable personal property; here, window frames. Sale of goods are governed by UCC.</p><p>b. Acknowledgment of Order. An acceptance is a manifestation by the offeror of present intent to be bound to the terms of the offer. Here, Windco sent an acknowledgment of order. Typically, an acknowledgment of receipt of order is not sufficient manifestation to be bound, so this was not necessarily an acceptance. However, UCC permits acceptance by any reasonable means.</p><p>c. Installing. Therefore, the fact that Windco performed and installed the frames will be Windcoâ€™s acceptance, because acceptance can be made by conduct.</p><p>3. Terms.</p><p>a. Merchants. A merchant is one who deals in the course of business with goods of the kind or holds himself out as having special skills in the area. Here, Windco was in the business of</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-2-</p><p><br></p><p>window frames, i.e., a merchant, and Sam was a commercial builder. Sam was a merchant, because he regularly dealt with and had skills in the area of windows. UCCâ€™s merchant-to- merchant rules will apply.</p><p>b. New terms between merchants. Between merchants, new and additional terms are included in the agreement unless: the offer was expressly conditional upon the offerorâ€™s terms, or acceptance was limited to the terms of the acceptance or the offeree objects to the new terms within 10 days.</p><p>(i) Samâ€™s written note - Time for performance.</p><p>Here, Sam will argu e that his â€œmust have guarantee - - - within 15 days...â€ was a term on which his offer was expressly conditioned, and that therefore Windcoâ€™s change to â€œwithin 60 daysâ€ is not included. However, Windco will argue that Samâ€™s wording did not say: â€œexpressly conditional uponâ€ or â€œoffer limited to . . .â€ &amp; that Samâ€™s words were only a desire, not an express condition. Windco will likely prevail &amp; the term is 60 days for installation.</p><p>(ii) Shipping charge &amp; parol evidence.</p><p>Windco will argue that its additional term â€œ$200 shipping chargeâ€ was included, because Sam didnâ€™t object within 10 days. In support, Windco will offer parol evidence of the custom in the industry that shipping is borne by the buyer (here: Sam).</p><p>Sam will say that oral evidence of prior or contemporaneous terms are not admissible if the writing was fully integrated. Sam will also argue that the additional $200 is material &amp; onerous &amp; changed the bargain &amp; that therefore the $200 is not included.</p><p>Windco will however be able to introduce oral evidence</p><p>to explain &amp; clarify what the shipping term was intended to be and what is customary in the trade, as such explanatory evidence is not barred by the parol evidence rule. Also, $200 on top of $3,000 total is not a material additional charge, so Windco will likely prevail &amp; the $200 term is included.</p><p>B. Consideration is the bargained-for exchange of acts or promises incurring a benefit as well as new legal detriment to both parties. Here, Sam obtained goods (benefit) in exchange for having to pay Windco (new detriment). Vice versa for Windco.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-3-</p><p><br></p><p>1. Promissory estoppel. If for any reason an enforceable K is not found, promissory estoppel is a substitute where one party has reasonably relied to his detriment on the otherâ€™s promise. Here, Windco went ahead with the installation &amp; supplied the frames. Doing so, it detrimentally relied on Samâ€™s promise.</p><p>Consideration or its substitute existed. C. Defenses to Formation</p><p>1. Statute of Frauds (SOF). SOF requires Ks for goods valued at $500 or more to be in a sufficient writing. Here, the K was for a total of $3,000 and had to be in writing. Since Sam is the one to be charged the $200 in dispute, his signature was required by SOF, but the â€œAck of Orderâ€ was on Windco letterhead.</p><p>a. Merchantâ€™s confirming memo. Where one merchant sends the other a memo confirming an agreement that the other has reason to know of and understand, the memo suffices as a writing under SOF even if not signed by the one to be charged. Here, since the Ack of Order contained subject matter (windows), identity of the parties, price &amp; Windcoâ€™s signature (or on Windcoâ€™s letterhead), SOF is satisfied.</p><p>b. Divisible K. It can also be argued that the contract was a sequence of contracts, each for $100, and that each such K therefore was not within SOF. The $200 would then be for installation services (governed by common law; not UCC) which do not fall within the SOF goods provision. Since the services were to be provided within one year (here: within 60 days), that SOF provision also doesnâ€™t require a writing signed by Sam.</p><p>An enforceable K was formed with terms $200 shipping &amp; installation within 60 days.</p><p>D. Recovery.</p><p>1. Expectation interest. Windco will recover its expectation interest, i.e., the price it expected to obtain under the contract, which was $3,000 + $200 shipping. Even if the court decides the $200 term was not part of the K, Windco will get $3,000.</p><p>2. Consequential &amp; Delay damages. It W can show that it suffered damages as a consequence of not receiving Samâ€™s payment on time, it will be awarded also consequential damages, i.e., those amounts reasonably foreseeable to flow from Samâ€™s breach at K formation time. Here, since Sam is refusing only to pay the $200 (not the $3,000), consequentials shouldnâ€™t apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-4-</p><p><br></p><p>II. Sam v. Windco. A. Recovery</p><p>1. Consequentials. If the court finds that the time to performance was within 15 days, then Sam will recover consequentials (defined supra). Delay damages that both parties knew or should have known would result from Windcoâ€™s failure to install timely would be recoverable.</p><p>B. Breach of implied warranty.</p><p>Each product put into the stream of commerce carries an implied warranty that the goods are suited for their ordinary use. Here, window frames should be suited for use when itâ€™s raining, i.e., not leak[ing].</p><p>1. Parties. Plaintiff must be a purchaser or user. Here, Sam was the purchaser of the windows. Defendant must be one generally in the commercial supply chain. Here, Windco was (see supra under merchants). The parties are proper.</p><p>2. Merchantable. Defined supra. The product was defective due to a manufacturing defect in that the glass didnâ€™t fit properly; thus not fit for ordinary use (not merchantable).</p><p>3. Defenses. Windco will assert that it disclaimed all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Such a disclaimer is effective if conspicuous, as here printed in bold. Sam will however argue his purpose for entering into the K was to obtain windows that were functional and that Windco will be unjustly enriched if allowed to not compensate him so he can obtain other substitute goods (to â€œcoverâ€) &amp; be reimbursed by Windco for his expenses therefor.</p><p>4. Perfect tender rule. Under the UCC, where goods are to be delivered in a single delivery, the buyer (here: Sam) has a right to obtain perfectly conforming goods. Even though Sam didnâ€™t discover the defect (non-conformity) of the goods until later, he can still reject the lot, accept the lot or any portion thereof, upon timely notice to Windco. If Windco still has time under the contract (5 days left from 55 to 60 days) to perform it has a right to cure by replacing the windows.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-5-</p><p><br></p><p>WINDCO v. SAM</p><p>Does the UCC Apply?</p><p>Answer B to Question 1</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼The UCC applies to all contracts for the sale of goods. Goods are moveable, tangible property.</p><p>Here, the subject matter is shown to [be] predominately goods because â€œinstallation comprises 15% of Windcoâ€™s total price.â€</p><p>Therefore, the UCC applies. Merchants?</p><p>A merchant is one who regularly deals in goods of this kind or who, by his occupation, has some special skill or knowledge as to this type of goods.</p><p>Here, â€œWindco manufactures and installs insulated window-frame unitsâ€ and Sam, â€œa commercial dealer,â€ likely has special knowledge of windows.</p><p>Therefore, both parties are merchants.</p><p>Valid Contract</p><p>In order to determine if any rights exist we first must determine if there is a valid, enforceable contract. A contract consists of an offer, acceptance, consideration and lack of formation defenses.</p><p>Offer</p><p>An offer is manifestation of present contractual intent, communicated to an identified offeree, containing definite and certain terms.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s ad will be considered only an invitation to accept offers. When Sam mailed this order form he made an offer to Windco, containing terms (30 window frames @$100/frame). A reasonable person would believe Sam made a commitment to enter a contract because of this information.</p><p>Therefore, there is a valid offer.</p><p>Acceptance and Acceptance With Addition[al] Terms UCC2-207</p><p>An acceptance is an unequivocal assent to the terms of a[n] offer, unlike common law, where the acceptance must be the â€œmirror image.â€ The UCC allows additional terms.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-6-</p><p><br></p><p>At issue here are the terms Sam first added to his offer guaranteeing installation within 15 days. Windcoâ€™s acknowledgment of order altered this term guaranteeing installation â€œwithin 60 days.â€ As between merchants any additional term will become part of the contract unless the contract limits it to its own terms, there is an objection within 10 days, or the term materially alters the contract.</p><p>Here, while Sam wanted installation within 15 days, the question arises if this qualifies as a time is of the essence condition. Because Sam did not object upon receiving Windcoâ€™s acceptance with additional terms, it likely will be held that this is not a material term. And this term will become part of the contract.</p><p>Shipping cost language will not be a material term as â€œshipping costs are customarily borne by the buyer.â€</p><p>Warranty disclaimers are valid if conspicuous and use the term merchantability.</p><p>Therefore, unless a court finds the installation date guaranty to be a material term, all of these terms will become part of the contract.</p><p>Consideration</p><p>Consideration is a legally sufficient, bargained-for exchange.</p><p>Here, there appear to be no consideration issues as Sam is to pay money, Windco is to provide window frames which neither were legally obligated to do.</p><p>Defenses-Statute of Frauds (SOF)</p><p>Under the statute of frauds certain contracts must be evidenced by a writing to be enforceable. Contracts for goods of $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds.</p><p>Such contracts can be taken out of the statute of frauds by performance. Facts here state â€œWindco installed the windo[ws].â€ Therefore, this contract can be taken out of the SOF.</p><p>In any case, because there are documents authenticated by both parties (mail order form by Sam &amp; acknowledgment of order by Windco) that are writings sufficient to bring the contract within the statute of frauds.</p><p>Therefore, the statute of frauds will no[t] prevent this contract from being enforceable.</p><p>Unconscionability</p><p>Unconscionability arises if there can be shown both procedural and substantive unconsc ionabili ty.</p><p>Here, Windcoâ€™s form stated â€œcontract of sale subject to terms herein.â€ Sam may attempt to claim this is substantively unconscionable, however to be procedurally</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-7-</p><p><br></p><p>unconscionable a party must show a lack of bargaining power. Nothing in the facts indicates that Sam could not have purchased window frames elsewhere. Further, to be substantively unconscionable the term must be one-sided. On these facts there is no indication Windco was greatly or significantly in a position to make such a windfall.</p><p>Therefore, unconscionability will fail as a defense. There is a valid enforceable contract.</p><p>Terms and Conditions</p><p>As shown above Windco performed by installing the windows. This condition precedent was fulfilled. It therefore falls upon Sam to meet his obligation or be in breach.</p><p>Breach</p><p>When one does not fulfill their obligation under a contract or excuse a condition they are in breach.</p><p>Here, Samâ€™s refusal to pay the $200 shipping fee is a breach. As noted above, this term became part of the contract because as shown by the usage in trade such a cost is â€œborne by the buyer.â€ Sam must pay the $200.</p><p>At issue here is the disclaimer of warranty discussed above. Often disclaimers of warranty can be material. However, as shown above, this disclaimer met the requirement of â€œbold &amp; conspicuousâ€ type and expressly mentioned â€œmerchantability and fitness.â€</p><p>Therefore, Sam will have no claim under either warranty or merchantability claim or a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. In fact, Sam did not indicate a particular purpose at time of contracting so as to become a basis of the bargain.</p><p>Remedies</p><p>As discussed above, Windco will receive the full contract price plus the $200 shipping fee.</p><p>However, if Sam can demonstrate that the late installation did cause the â€œseveral delay-related expensesâ€ th[at] he claims this will be considered a minor breach (usually timely performance is not a major breach and, as shown above, this contract does not qualify as a â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ contract).</p><p>Therefore, Sam will be able to offset the delay-related costs against the contract price, thus reducing his payment by that amount, because Windco will be found to have substantially performed. The court abhors a waste and will reduce Samâ€™s debt by the difference between what the building now is worth and what it would have been worth if the contract was fulfilled as expected.</p>', NULL, '<p>Windco Vs Sam</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);\">The rights and remedies of the parties depend on whether or not there was a valid contract.

He builds the house facing the wrong direction. The error does not cause the house to have any less market value, but lifting the house and turning it the right direction would cost $25,000.

Jon had seen and admired Debbieâ€™s â€œon locationâ€ photography work. He called Debbie to arrange for photography as part of his promotional plan for the spa. Jon told her that he planned to trim 50 pounds from his own considerably hefty frame by participating in the program of diet, exercise and strength training offered at the spa. He wanted to have â€œbefore and afterâ€ pictures taken of himself eating at the spa, working out on the spa exercise equipment and hiking along one of the spaâ€™s scenic trails. The photographs were to be displayed in strategic locations throughout the spa and would be included in the spaâ€™s brochure. Debbie stated that the total charge for the photography (which would consist of five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures and five â€œafterâ€ pictures) would be $1,000. The parties agreed that the â€œbeforeâ€ pictures would be taken on the following day.</p><p>When Debbie arrived at the spa, she learned for the first time that it was a health spa for nudists. Debbie was extremely uncomfortable, but the naked Jon persuaded her to stay and take the first set of pictures.</p><p>On the next day, Jon received the five â€œbeforeâ€ pictures and a letter from Debbie requesting immediate payment of $500, and stating that the five â€œafterâ€ pictures would be taken by her assistant upon notification that Jon had lost 50 pounds.</p><p>Jon consults you and asks the following questions:</p><p>1. Does an enforceable contract exist between Debbie and Jon? Discuss.</p><p>2. Assuming that an enforceable contract exists, can Jon require Debbie to take the â€œafterâ€ pictures personally? Discuss.</p><p>3. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>Answer A to Question 3</p><p>ï¿¼This is a contract primarily for services and will be analyzed using common law principles. Debbie is a photographer and contract is for services - taking the photographs (not for the photos themselves) for common law. UCC rules discussed when they apply only. (Uniform Commercial Code).</p><p>I. Don v. Debbie - Enforceable Contract? A. Formation</p><p>1. Mutual Assent</p><p>a. Offer must contain subject matter, definite terms, and intention to be bound. Here, Jon called Debbie and discussed the 10 photos and their purpose, the terms, and expressed intention to be bound. Offer is valid.</p><p>b. Acceptance. Must be a mirror image agreement to the offer and express the intention to be bound. Here, Debbie accepts Jonâ€™s offer, and both agree to the specific terms.</p><p>c. Consideration. Is a bargained fo r exchange of legal detriment. Here, Debbie agrees to take pictures in exchange for Jonâ€™s payment of money. Consideration is adequate.</p><p>II. Defenses</p><p>A. Statute of Frauds - (SOF) valuable and easily misunderstood contracts must be in writing.</p><p>1) UCC $500 Rule - In order for the contract to be enforceable, it must be in writing if the value of the goods is more than $500 (valuable). Here, under UCC, a writing is necessary. But because this contract is primarily a services contract, it would be enforceable without a writing.</p><p>a. One year rule - Both UCC and Non-UCC. If a contract, at time at formation, cannot be performed within one year, a writing is necessaryforthecontracttobeenforceable. Here,(hopefully) Jon can lose 50# in less than one year, and this rule does not apply. The contract is valid without a written contract.</p><p>b. Impossibility/Impracticability</p><p>If there are intervening events that occur which are unforeseeable, the performance is excused (leg. [sic] illegality destruction of subject matter, death/incapacity of the parties).</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-22-</p><p><br></p><p>Here, Debbie became uncomfortable when she found out that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp. She would try to assert that being uncomfortable once was enough; the second time was impossible for her.</p><p>c. Mistake</p><p>When Ã¢Debbie did not know that Jonâ€™s spa was a nudist camp, Ã£Jon did not tell her that it was a nudist camp, and Ã¤neither party knew (at formation) that Debbie was not comfortable in the nudist camp, there was a mutual mistake. The contract is voidable by either party.</p><p>Unilateral mistake - If Jon could argue that Debbie should ha ve known or asked about certain circumstances that precluded her work, he can prevail on this issue.</p><p>If Debbie can show that Jon should have told her that his spa was a nudist camp, Debbie would prevail. The mistake is chargeable to the more unreasonable party.</p><p>d. Detrimental Reliance - Promissory Estoppel</p><p>Partial performance - Jon would argue that there was a partial performance by Debbie and that he relied reasonably and detrimentally that Debbie would finish the job.</p><p>e. Modification</p><p>At common law, modification requires additional consideration. At UCC, only good faith is necessary. Consideration substitutes can be used, e.g. detrimental reliance, supra. Here, Debbie wishes to modify contract from $1,000 for 10 photos to $500 for 5 photos. She can prevail at common law if she can show additional consideration, or, at UCC, good faith. But Jon has no consideration. This modification is not valid.</p><p>III. Can Jon require Debbie to take â€œafterâ€ pictures?</p><p>A. Delegation of Duty - Courts favor assignment and delegation. The delegation must be with the consent of the obligee or must not be to his detriment. Here, if Jon does not want to give consent for delegation of duty to Debbieâ€™s assistant, he must show that there is diminution in value of the services.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-23-</p><p><br></p><p>B. Personal Services - Contracts are not assignable. If Jon can assert that Debbieâ€™s services were so personal that her duties cannot be delegated, he would prevail. Debbie would argue that photography is not like a portrait and that an equally qualified photographer (such as her assistant) could perform just as well. However, courts are reluctant to enforce specific performance on personal service contracts. Damages would likely be in expectation damages.</p><p>IV. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time?</p><p>A. Express v. Constructive Conditions</p><p>All express conditions must be completely performed to avoid breach. Constructive conditions must be substantially performed to avoid breach. Here, the question would be whether there was an express (v. constructive) condition that the total job would need to be completed before payment in order to avoid breach. The courts wonâ€™t likely construe this to mean the entire contract.</p><p>B. Divisible Contract?</p><p>If Debbie can successfully argue that the contract consisted of 2 parts (before and after) she would be entitled to partial payment for partial performance. This is not a divisible contract and Jon would prevail.</p><p>C. Modification valid?</p><p>No, for inadequate consideration, supra.</p><p>D. Quasi - Contract Recovery</p><p>In order to avoid unjust enrichment the court considers recovery in Quasi-Contracts. Traditionally, only the non-breaching party could recover. In modern law, the breaching party could also recover if the breach were not willful and in good faith. Here, Debbie would be able to recover $500 for value of the before photographs, because her breach was in good faith.</p><p>V. Damages under UCC</p><p>1. Sellerâ€™s breach - When seller breaches, the buyer is entitled to market price minus contract price. Alternatively, buyer can â€œcover.â€</p><p>A buyer is entitled to seek replacement from another buyer and sue the seller for the difference.</p><p>ï¿¼-24-</p><p><br></p><p>Answer B to Question 3</p><p>Enforceable Contract Between Debbie and Jon? Since this is not a contract for goods common law will be the authority. 1. Contract?</p><p>A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty and the breach of which the law will provide a remedy [sic]. It consists of mutual assent and [is] supported by consideration.</p><p>2. Was There an Offer by Debbie?</p><p>An offer is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree such that a reasonable person would conclude that a bargain had been formed. Under common law an offer must include: parties, subject matter, price, and time and quantity. Here the parties are implied because she is â€œstatingâ€ this to Jon.</p><p>The quantity is stated as â€œ5 before pic[ture]s and 5 afterâ€ pictures. The price is â€œ$1,000 dollars and the time is the next dayâ€. Therefore there is a valid offer here.</p><p>3. Acceptance?</p><p>An acceptance is an affirmative assent communicated to the offeror in the manner requested, if not requested then in a reasonable manner. An acceptance to a bilateral offer may be by return promise or by performance.</p><p>Here there is an acceptance because â€œthe parties agreedâ€ that the before pictures would be taken the following day. Therefore Jon assented to the onset of Debbieâ€™s performance.</p><p>4. Consideration?</p><p>Is a bargained-for exchange that causes legal detriment. Here there is consideration because Debbie is promising to take photographs (using her professional skills and time) and Jon is promising to pay Debbie $1,000.</p><p>5. Statute of Frauds?</p><p>The statute requires that certain contracts be reduced to writing to be enforceable. One of these is for goods $500 and over. Although this seems like a contract for Debbieâ€™s services as a photographer, she is also producing tangible moveable goods. The goods were not moveable at the time the contract was formed, however, and therefore the statute would not apply. Therefore a contract exists and</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-26-</p><p><br></p><p>it is enforceable.</p><p>Contract?</p><p>Jon v. Debbie</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Assuming a contract exists, supra, what are the rights Jon may assert?</p><p>Was there an enforceable delegation from Debbie to assistant?</p><p>The law favors delegations. A delegation occurs when one party delegates his duties under an existing contract to a third party.</p><p>Here there is a delegation because Debbie says â€œthe after pictures would be taken by the assistant.â€</p><p>Is the delegation binding on the assistant? A delegation is binding on the delegatee only if they knowingly consent; usually consideration is involved. There are no facts stating whether the assistant consented. One could reasonably assume she was being compensated and consideration would exist.</p><p>Debbie would remain liable for performance as the delegator. Are there exceptions to an enforceable delegation? Exceptions -</p><p>1. Prohibited by contract;</p><p>2. Prohibited by statute;</p><p>3. Too personal in nature.</p><p>Here there may be a valid exception because it could be argued that the artistry of a â€œwell known photographerâ€ is too personal in nature to delegate.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be able to delegate her services. Can Jon demand that Debbie take the pictures?</p><p>Where specific performance would require one to personally perform it will not be enforced based on a prohibition on involuntary servitude.</p><p>Therefore Debbie would not be forced to perform. She may, however, be enjoined from performing elsewhere during that time.</p><p>Her discomfort may be a factor to rebut based on impracticability. Debbie v. Jon</p><p>If Debbie doesnâ€™t perform is she entitled to partial compensation?</p><p>ï¿¼-27-</p><p><br></p><p>If Debbieâ€™s â€œextreme discomfortâ€ can be shown to make performance impracticable she may be entitled to services already rendered.</p><p>Impracticability exists where a reasonably unforeseeable intervening event, the risk of which was not assumed by either party, makes performance extremely difficult; the duties of the parties may be discharged. Here may be reasonably unforeseeable because â€œit was a nudist camp and Debbie didnâ€™t find out about it until that day. There is no indication she assumed this risk. In order to be successful, she would have to [show] that it would be very difficult to perform the contract. Since â€œJon persuaded her to stayâ€ the first time, it may be difficult.</p><p>She may be able to recover quantum meruit for the services already provided.</p><p>She may argue that there was a divisible contract and recover under this theory. â€œJon received the 5 before picturesâ€ and Debbieâ€™s demand for payment. There is nothing in the contract telling us there is a separate delivery for a separate payment.</p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:26', 1),

Rather than inflicting the intended leg wound, the bullet ricocheted off the sidewalk and hit Vic in the heart, killing him instantly.</p><p>1. With what crime or crimes should Dan be charged? Discuss. </p><p>2. What defense or defenses might Dan assert? Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p>AGGRAVATED ASSAULT</p><p>Answer A to Question 2 STATE V. DAN (D)</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Assault is either a substantial step toward an intended battery or the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm. Modernly, an aggravated assault is an assault committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D shot at Vic (V), intending to wound him. If V was apprehensive of being shot, D will be guilty of assault. Additionally, because D shot at V with a deadly weapon, a gun, D will modernly be guilty of aggravated assault.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated assault. However, the assault will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>AGGRAVATED BATTERY</p><p>Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another. Modernly, a battery is aggravated if it is committed with a deadly weapon.</p><p>Here, D intended to wound V by shooting V in the leg. However, the bullet actually killed V by striking him elsewhere. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, D will be guilty of the battery because the intended harm was criminal, and there is great similarity between the intended harm and the harm that actually occurred. Furthermore, because D used a gun to batter V, D will be guilty of aggravated battery.</p><p>D will be guilty of aggravated battery, though it will merge with the subsequent homicide.</p><p>HOMICIDE OF V</p><p>HOMICIDE is the killing of a human being by another human being. Here, the facts indicate that D killed V by shooting at V with a gun. There is a homicide.</p><p>CAUSATION - ACTUAL CAUSE</p><p>But for D shooting at V, V would not have died.</p><p>CAUSATION - PROXIMATE CAUSE</p><p>It is foreseeable that shooting to someone with intent to injure could result in a death.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼MURDER</p><p>ï¿¼-12-</p><p><br></p><p>Murder is an unlawful homicide committed with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought may be proven under any of four theories.</p><p>1) INTENT TO KILL - Intent requires the conscious desire to cause the criminal result. The facts indicate that D only intended to wound V, not kill V. Thus, D did not have the specific intent to kill.</p><p>2) INTENT TO INFLICT SERIOUS BODILY HARM - Here, the facts indicate that D shot at V with the intent to hitting [sic] V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg is likely to cause serious bodily harm and the facts indicate that D intended to wound V. Under this theory, then, D intended to cause serious bodily harm.</p><p>3) DEPRAVED HEART ACT - A depraved heart act is a wanton and reckless disregard for the value of human life. Here, D shot at V in a public place with an intent to wound V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg present[s] numerous, dangerous risk[s] to his welfare and court[s] normally hold that any act that [is] likely to cause serious harm to others is a depraved heart act if the risk is disregarded.</p><p>4) APPLICATION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE - A killing will be felony if it 1) occurs during the res gestae of a dangerous felony or a felony committed in a dangerous way, 2) is foreseeable, and 3) is independent of the target crime. Here, the State will not bring a charge of felony murder, because the only predicate felonies would merge with the crime. Because of public policy reasons, courts refuse to apply felony murder to felonious assaults and batteries, otherwise, strict liability for first degree murder would result from each killing.</p><p>Having found malice under the theories of 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, the State will proceed as follows.</p><p>FIRST DEGREE MURDER</p><p>First degree murder is an unlawful homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation and specific intent to kill. Premeditation and deliberation may be proven by application of the felony murder rule, or a killing by poison, bomb, torture, or ambush.</p><p>Here, the facts indicate that D lacked the specific intent to kill and the felony murder rule will not apply. The State will not bring a charge of first degree murder.</p><p>SECOND DEGREE MURDER</p><p>All murder not raised to the first degree shall be second degree murder.</p><p>Here, because the State proved malice under two theories, but did not raise the charge to first degree murder, the State will bring a charge of second degree murder. Because the State established malice under 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, D will be guilty of second degree murder absent a defense.</p><p>D will be guilty of second degree murder.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-13-</p><p><br></p><p>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional homicide committed with malice, but with mitigation. Mitigation may be proven by adequate provocation or mistaken justification.</p><p>Here, D may try to claim that he was provoked into shooting V. However, the first element of adequate provocation requires that a reasonable person be provoked by the conduct. Here, a reasonable person would not have been provoked by Vâ€™s approach, so V may not claim provocation. Additionally, D may claim that his defense of self-defense is imperfect and results in a charge of voluntary manslaughter. As discussed infra, D will raise a defense of self-defense, and this defense will be imperfect. A court may apply this rule of mitigation to lessen the offense to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>The State may bring a charge of voluntary manslaughter. D will be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he succeeds in mitigating his crime by an imperfect self- defense claim.</p><p>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide that results from 1) application of the misdemeanor manslaughter rule, 2) intent to inflict non-serious bodily harm, 3) criminal negligence.</p><p>Here, D will try to mitigate his charge by claiming that the homicide was only involuntary manslaughter. D will claim that he only intended non-serious bodily harm and the killing was accidental. However, court[s] consistently hold that any intent to harm with a deadly weapon infers an intent to inflict serious bodily harm.</p><p>Additionally, D may claim that he was only criminally negligent, not reckless. Dâ€™s claim may work depending on the surrounding situation of the terrain.</p><p>The State may charge D with the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>DEFENSES TO HOMICIDE</p><p>SELF-DEFENSE</p><p>Self-defense [is] the actual and reasonable apprehensions of bodily harm.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he believed V would harm him. However, this belief is not reasonable, because a reasonable person would not have assumed Vâ€™s approach</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-14-</p><p><br></p><p>meant V intended to do harm. Furthermore, D used unreasonable force because V was not threatening any harm.</p><p>Dâ€™s claim of self-defense will fail, but may constitute an imperfect self-defense that mitigates the homicide, as discussed supra.</p><p>INSANITY - Mâ€™NAUGHTEN RULE</p><p>The defendant is entitled to acquittal, if at the time of the crimes and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) did not know the nature or quality of his act, 2) or that his act was wrong.</p><p>Under this rule, D may claim that he believed V was going to attack D and kill D. If D subjectively held this belief, then he would have been permitted to defend himself. Even though this believe was unreasonable, in jurisdictions applying the Mâ€™Naughten rule, D may not have believed his act was wrong.</p><p>D may be able to escape guilt under the Mâ€™Naughten rule.</p><p>INSANITY - MODEL PENAL CODE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if at the time of the crime and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, or 2) did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>Even though D was capable of conforming to the requirements of the law, he may claim that he did not know his act was wrong, because he believed he needed to defend himself. In jurisdictions holding to the MPC insanity position, D would need to prove he did not know his act was wrong.</p><p>D may avoid guilt under the MPC test for insanity.</p><p>IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TEST</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the result of an irresistible impulse that overcame his will.</p><p>Under this test, D would need to prove he was unable to control himself when he shot V. This test would p robably no t provide a defens e becaus e D could h ave controlled himself, he just thought he needed to defend himself.</p><p>D will probably be guilty in jurisdictions applying the irresistible impulse test.</p><p>DURHAM RULE</p><p>Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the product of a mental defect.</p><p>Here, Dâ€™s crime appears to be the product of a mental defect. That is, D believed V would kill D because of a delusion.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-15-</p><p><br></p><p>In the minority of jurisdictions that apply the Durham Rule, D may avoid guilt because the crime was the product of mental defect.</p><p>WELLS-GORSHEN RULE</p><p>Under the Wells-Gorshen rule, insanity defenses that do not give rise to absolute defenses may negate the mens rea requirement of a crime.</p><p>Here, D may claim that he lacked the mens rea to commit murder because he thought V was going to do harm to D. However, under the malice theories, the State proved that D intended to harm V. Even though D thought he was acting in self-defense, he still intended this harm.</p><p>The Wells-Gorshen rule will not apply here.</p><p>DIMINISHED CAPACITY</p><p>Here, D may try to argue that his delusions diminished his capacity to form the intent to commit murder. This rule only applies in a small minority of jurisdictions and usually is applicable only to negate the mens rea of a crime. Here, D is not seeking to negate the mens rea.</p><p>Diminished capacity will not apply.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼-16-</p><p><br></p><p>CHARLES V. DAN</p><p>HOMICIDE CHARGES.</p><p>Answer B to Question 2</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Murder: Murder is the voluntary taking of the life of another with malice. Malice can be shown by perpetratorâ€™s intent to kill, by his being responsible for death during commission of a dangerous felony (â€œfelony murderâ€), by acting in a manner demonstrating a wanton disregard for human life, or by intending to inflict serious injury.</p><p>Here, Dan is on a busy street and is approached by someone he imagines intends to hurt him. Dan is carrying a concealed weapon, a gun, with which he shoots in Vicâ€™s direction intending, he says, â€œonly to wound him,â€ but a ricochet bullet kills Vic.</p><p>-There is clearly a homicide and Dan is clearly the cause. But for Danâ€™s firing, voluntarily, the gun, Vic would not be dead.</p><p>-Intent: First degree murder is a specific intent crime, usually shown by evidence of premeditation and deliberation, or by felony murder. Felony murder is not likely to apply here. Though crimes of carrying [a] concealed weapon and criminal assault might be felonies, the shooting did not occur in furtherance of these crimes. So, premeditation and deliberation are the focus [sic]. A case can be made that Dan premeditated this crime by the fact that he was carrying a concealed gun. Moreover, deliberation can occur in a very short time; even a momentâ€™s deliberation can be enough to sustain the charges. Here Dan thought about his act long enough to consider Vicâ€™s â€œscruffyâ€ appearance to be a threat to him, and to decide to shoot.</p><p>Second Degree Murder</p><p>Intent to inflict serious bodily harm satisfies the malice requirement. Vic shot â€œto wound Vic in the legs.â€ A bullet to the legs is surely serious bodily harm, so Vic can be found to have malice on this basis.</p><p>Likewise, Vicâ€™s shooting a gun on a â€œbusy streetâ€ is likely â€œwanton disregard for human lifeâ€ so that Vicâ€™s malice can be shown to be based upon â€œdepraved heart.â€</p><p>Finally, the killing of a person by â€œdangerous meansâ€ as a lethal weapon, here, a gun, is sufficient to establish intent.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Prosecutor can charge Dan with first degree murder based upon his intent, shown by carrying and firing [a] gun on [a] busy street and his premeditation. Second degree murder included.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Assault and Battery</p><p>ï¿¼-17-</p><p><br></p><p>Criminal assault merges into battery where the threat which constitutes assault occurs simultaneously with the harmful touching required for battery.</p><p>Criminal battery is the harmful or offensive touching of another without consent. The touching may be indirect so long as a physical touching occurs and the object which touches was set in motion by the perpetrator. Here Dan clearly caused the bullet to â€œtouchâ€ Vic in harmful manner.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Vic can be charged with criminal assault and battery. N.B. Legal statutes may result in a gun charge v. Dan. Defenses For Dan</p><p>Justification</p><p>A justification excuses the crime and results in â€œno crime.â€ Here, Dan will argue self- defense as justification. Self-defense excuses a killing if the perpetrator acted reasonably (general intent) and in good faith (specific and general intent crimes) to protect self from serious bodily injury or death and if the actions in defense were proportionate to the threat.</p><p>Here, Dan will argue he only acted to save himself from Vic, whom he believed intended to kill him, and that deadly force was proportionate and justified.</p><p>However, since Vic made no threatening gestures toward Dan and there are facts suggesting Vic was brandishing a weapon, a reasonable person in Danâ€™s position would not have concluded his life was in jeopardy. So Danâ€™s excuse falls in the majority. His â€œgood faithâ€ alone is irrelevant to second degree murder, a general intent crime. In a minority of jurisdictions, if his mistake is found to be in â€œhonestâ€ or in â€œgood faith,â€ the crime may be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Self-defense is not likely available to Dan.</p><p>Excuses:</p><p>Dan will defend saying he did not have the requisite intent for murder.</p><p>He will say he only intended to wound Vic. However, as discussed above, both the specific intent for first degree murder and general intent for second degree are supported by his acts. His intent to do serious bodily harm by wounding Vic with a bullet, the use of a gun, [and] the thinking he did before firing all support Vicâ€™s having requisite intent for murder, arguably first degree.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-18-</p><p><br></p><p>Insanity</p><p>In majority the defense of insanity is established if, at the time of the offense, the perpetrator was suffering from a serious mental defect or disease such that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act or to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law (A.L.I).</p><p>Here, while Dan is described as having a â€œpathological fearâ€ of long -haired persons, we do not know if he has had an established diagnosis of serious mental illness. If he does have such a defect or disease, Dan will have to show that his delusional state was of the kind that anyone believing as he did would have acted in the manner he did or that his disease caused him to lack substantial capacity to understand that he was shooting someone or that it is a crime to do so.</p><p>Involuntary Manslaughter</p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another in a state of passion or high emotional arousal caused by a provocation, more than mere words, that would have aroused such emotion in any reasonable person in that position, and that th ere was no time for the person to â€œcool offâ€, and that he did not, in fact, cool off.</p><p>Here Dan will argue that Vicâ€™s coming toward him looking as he did caused Dan to be so afraid that he acted in a state of high emotion.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Danâ€™s arousal is not that which a reasonable person in his situation would experience. Danâ€™s mental illness is not considered in this formulation.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Charges of murder in first degree will lie against Dan, though they may be dropped to second degree murder. Danâ€™s defenses will fail, except possibly the insanity defense, for which we have insufficient information to decide.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:27:41', 1),

Discuss.</p>', '<p><b>Sample Answers</b></p><p><br></p><p>I. Child vs. Zoo</p><p>Answer A to Question 4</p><p>ï¿¼Strict Liability. For the child to recover against zoo in strict liability she must simply show that the wild animal causing her injury was owned by or under the care of the zoo and that she suffered injury that were [sic] of the type consistent with foreseeable harm by the wild animal. This is because owners/caretakers of wild animals are strictly liable for the reasonable and foreseeable harm caused by the wild animal.</p><p>Here, the zebra was clearly under the care/control of the zoo when it escaped from its cage. As such, zoo would be strictly liable for any reasonable/foreseeable harm the animal causes.</p><p>Zoo will argue that the child assumed the risk when it petted the zebra and offered itastickofcandy. However,giventhefactthatthezebraisgenerallyconsidered to be a wild animal, and that it is foreseeable that it could bite if in close proximity to a person, this would not relieve zooâ€™s liability.</p><p>II. Child vs. Zoo</p><p>Negligence. For child to recover against zoo in negligence, she must show duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages.</p><p>[Note: Zooâ€™s liability would be based on various liability under the theory of respondeat superior as the zooâ€™s employer (Maintenance Man), and the performance of his duty, set into motion the series of events that resulted in childâ€™s injury.]</p><p>Duty. Dutyariseswhenthereisalegallyrecognizedrelationshipbetweenplaintiff and defendant that results in defendant having to act is [sic] some fashion other than arbitrarily towards plaintiff. The duty owed is one of reasonable care towards all foreseeable plaintiffs in the zone of danger created by defendantâ€™s negligence.</p><p>At common law, duty was largely based on oneâ€™s status in relationship to defendant. One could be an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser. Here the child plaintiff was not on defendantâ€™s property at the time of the accident, but rather was in a residential area â€œnearbyâ€ the zoo. As zoo is in the business of housing, caring for, and maintaining wild animals, it should be reasonably foreseeable that an accident could arise that would result in an animal being left loose in the nearby community, and because of the nature of a wild animalâ€™s behavior, harm could have resulted to a person in the nearby community. This is particularly true where children are around.</p><p>BreachofDuty. Breachofdutyariseswhendefendantâ€™sactionsdonotrisetothe standard of care required by the law. Here, Learned Handâ€™s approach would note that the zoo breached its duty if the cost incurred with avoiding the harm causing incident was less than the product of the probability of the harm causing incident</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-30-</p><p><br></p><p>arising and the magnitude of loss should the harm causing event occur.</p><p>Here, a fire caused a large water main to break with the ensuing rush of water washing away a portion of the zebraâ€™s pen fence. When considering a pen fence, (as opposed to a sturdy cage), itâ€™s entirely foreseeable that a sudden deluge of water could wash away a portion of the â€œfence.â€ As such, the zoo should have ensured construction of a caged facility that would be sturdy enough to withstand this type of accident.</p><p>The cost involved with the construction of a pen of this nature would be significantly less than the potential danger that a wild animal could cause to men, women, and children in a nearby area should that animal escape. As such, it could be argued that the zoo breached its duty.</p><p>Causation. For liability to arise, the zoo (or in this case, the zooâ€™s employee) would have to be both actual and primary cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Actual Cause. Actual cause arises when â€œbut forâ€ defendantâ€™s actions, plaintiff would not have been injured. Here, the zooâ€™s maintenance employee threw a pile of cleaning rags saturated with a flammable cleaning fluid into a hot, enclosed room. The mainten ance man should ha ve known that there was the potential for the rags igniting resulting in a fire. When this happened, the fire set into motion a series of events that resulted in the zebra getting free and the child being bitten. As such, â€œbut forâ€ the maintenance manâ€™s action, the childâ€™s injury would not have occurred.</p><p>Proximate Cause. Arises when a result is the natur[al] and probable/reasonable and foreseeable consequences of defendantâ€™s actions. Here, we look to see if the injury is of the type reasonably expected, or was significantly more severe than reasonably expected. Here, there was a fire, that resulted in a water main bursting, that resulted in a fence being washed away, that led to a zebra escaping, that resulted in a child being bitten by the zebra. The zoo could reasonably argue that the type of injury resulting to the child was not of the type that would be the foreseeable natural consequence of a fire that caused a water main to break. As such, they could avoid liability as the maintenance manâ€™s actions would not be the proximate cause of the childâ€™s injury.</p><p>Defenses. Atcommonlaw,contributingnegligencewasacompletebartorecovery. Here, the zoo could argue that the child was contributorily negligent when she petted the zebra and fed it candy. If the court argued, child would be barred from recovery.</p><p>Comparative Fault. Today, most jurisdictions have adopted comparative fault. Here, the could [sic] would weight [sic] the percentage of responsibility on each of the parties and assess damages accordingly. If child was less at fault than zoo, she could recover accordingly.</p><p>Assumption of Risk. If it can be shown that the child knew the consequences of her actions and knowingly embraced the danger, this could bar her from recovery. This would be a matter of fact for the court to decide.</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-31-</p><p><br></p><p>Child v. Zoo Strict Liability</p><p>Answer B to Question 4</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼Owners of trespassing wild animals will be held strictly liable (no fault need be shown) for damages proximately caused by the animals.</p><p>Zebra a Wild Animal?</p><p>A wild animal is one that is not domesticated (does not serve man). A zebra is a wild animal because its only use is to be displayed in a zoo. This zebra is from a zoo and thus is considered wild.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>The damage to the child was both actually (BUT-FOR TEST) and proximately (LEGALLY) caused by the zebra because the zebra bit off the childâ€™s fingers [sic]. But for this biting, the child would not have lost his fingers [sic]. There are no superseding causes.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>The child lost his fingers [sic].</p><p>Defense.</p><p>Because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability, the only question is whether Child assumed the risk.</p><p>ASSUMPTION OF RISK requires plaintiff to understand the nature and extent of the risk and to disregard that risk. Here there is no evidence that Child apprehended a risk when approaching the Zebra. Indeed, Childâ€™s offer of candy was a friendly gesture that showed Child probably was comfortable and had no idea that his fingers were in danger.</p><p>Therefore Child did not assume the risk of injury.</p><p>Domestic Animal?</p><p>Zoo could try to claim that, like a horse, a Zebra is a domestic animal, and as such, Zoo would not be strictly liable unless the zebra had known dangerous tendencies. However, this claim should be dismissed because a zebra only looks like a horse; they [sic] are not, however, domesticated.</p><p>Under the facts Child should be able to recover from Zoo in Strict Liability. Negligence?</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-33-</p><p><br></p><p>Negligence is conduct that falls below the standard of care set by law to protect others from unreasonable risk of harm.</p><p>Here Child may also assert a claim in negligence if he can show that Zoo breached an owed duty to him, actually and proximately causing Childâ€™s damages.</p><p>Vicarious Liability</p><p>Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR Zoo will be liable for torts committed by its employees if they act within the scope of their duties.</p><p>Here the maintenance employee was doing his duties, cleaning up, when he threw the rag into the hot room. Zoo will be liable for any tort arising from this act if it is tortious.</p><p>Duty.</p><p>Zoo owes a duty to act as a reasonable zoo. In addition, as possessor of land, they owe a duty not to harm others outside their land by activities on the land.</p><p>Breach.</p><p>Under Cardozo from the Palsgraf decision a duty is owed to all foreseeable plaintiffs, generally within the zone of the activity. Here it is foreseeable that an escaped Zebra would run into civilians and so Zoo was under a duty to be very careful this wouldnâ€™t happen.</p><p>Here Zoo breached this duty in possibly several ways.</p><p>1. First, Child could argue that Zooâ€™s employee was negligent in not realizing that a rag soaked with a flammable liquid could spontaneously combust in a hot enclosed room. This, however, is a poor argument because most maintenance men do not have that understanding of physics and chemistry.</p><p>2. Second, Child could claim that Zoo did not build a strong enough fence to keep the zebras penned in. This is not so strong either because the force from the broken water main probably exceeded any natural force that could reasonably be foreseen. But if the fence was not strong for normal wear and tear Child could show breach here.</p><p>3. A third argument, much better, is that Zoo has a duty to notice when wild animals escape and has ready plans to round them up or tranquilize them if they do escape. Here it seems Zoo did nothing while the zebra ran away.</p><p>Therefore Zoo has breached its duty to control its animals.</p><p>Causation.</p><p>Zoo might claim that the Childâ€™s offer of candy was superseding cause that breaks</p><p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼-34-</p><p><br></p><p>the chain of proximate causation. However, Child would have to be doing something independent and unforeseeable for Zoo to prevail. While carrying candy is not a response to an escaped zebra, it is not unforeseeable that a child should have candy, nor is it unforeseeable that such a child might offer it to the zebra.</p><p>Damages.</p><p>Discussed supra.</p><p>Defenses.</p><p>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is conduct by the plaintiff that fails to conform to the standard of care set by law for the plaintiffâ€™s own protection.</p><p>Here a CHILD STANDARD OF CARE applies. Child will be expected to act as a reasonable child of similar age, experience, and education will act in similar circumstances.</p><p>Here Childâ€™s behavior is typical of a â€œyoung childâ€ and is therefore not negligent. ASSUMPTION OF RISK fails for the similar reason as discussed supra. Therefore Child could also recover for his damages under Negligence theory.</p>', NULL, NULL, '2017-09-25 13:29:57', 1),

Otherwise the varying terms are considered only â€œproposed modificationsâ€.</p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>8.&nbsp;Had the OFFER LAPSED before acceptance was attempted?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition: </b>Under common law an offer <b>LAPSES AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED</b> unless it is accepted in a <b>reasonable period</b> of time. Oral offers are deemed to lapse at the end of the conversation, and written offers are deemed to lapse within the timeframe implied by the means of dispatch, absent contrary agreement or implication.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>9.&nbsp;Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Definition: Under the MAILBOX RULES of the common law an acceptance is effective when dispatched, if dispatched in the <b>manner specified</b> in the offer, or by the <b>same or faster </b>means the offer was transmitted where the offer does not specify a means of communication.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>10.&nbsp;Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REJECTION?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b> Under the MAILBOX RULES of contract law a rejection is effective upon receipt while an acceptance may be effective upon dispatch. An EXCEPTION is made if the <b>OFFEROR CHANGES POSITION</b> in reliance upon a communication of rejection, not knowing that an acceptance was dispatched prior to receipt of the rejection. In that case the rejection is effective upon receipt regardless of the fact an acceptance was also dispatched.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>11.&nbsp;Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REVOCATION?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b>&nbsp;Under the MAILBOX RULES revocation of a contract offer is usually <b>effective upon receipt</b> by the offeree.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">For an unequivocal unilateral offer also say, as appropriate, Under common law a unilateral offer could be revoked at any time, and revocation of GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, was effective when published in the same manner the offer was first announced. But modernly SAVING DOCTRINES prevent the revocation of a unilateral contract offer if the offeror is <b>aware the offeree has commenced the requested act </b>for a reasonable period during which the offeree will be allowed to complete acceptance by performance.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>12.&nbsp;Was there an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b> Under contract law an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT will be deemed to have existed, even if there is no express agreement between the parties, if <b>one party acts to bestow benefits </b>on the other party <b>reasonably expecting to be compensated</b>, and the other party <b>knowingly accepts those benefits</b> knowing that the other party expects to be compensated.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">An implied-in-fact contract is an actual, legal contract. The party that knowingly receives the benefits is liable for a reasonable contract amount to the other party.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>13.&nbsp;Is a WRITING needed?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If ONLY common law governs say,</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition: </b>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be written in order to be legally enforced, and one type is a contract for (pick one if it applies here -- MARRIAGE, more than a YEAR, LAND, EXECUTOR of an estate, GUARANTEE of a debt).</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Remember:</b> My Leg</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If UCC say,<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition: </b>Under UCC 2-201, a contract for <b>sale</b> of <b>goods</b> worth <b>$500 or more</b> must evidenced by a writing sufficient to show the existence of a contract and <b>signed</b> by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. But between merchants a SALES CONFIRMATION by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Furthermore, the UCC provides exceptions for <b>SPECIAL MADE</b> GOODS, where there is an <b>ADMISSION</b> by the party to be bound that there had been an agreement, or where there has been <b>PARTIAL PERFORMANCE</b> of the contract (i.e. acceptance of some or all goods or payment).<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under UCC 2-209 contract modifications must be written to be legally enforceable if the contract, as modified, is for over $500. Otherwise modification agreements will be treated as waivers of conditions that can be always be retracted, unless the Court estops retraction to prevent injustice.</font></p><hr><p><b style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">B. Contract Terms</b></p><p><b style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">14.&nbsp;What were the CONTRACT TERMS?</b><br></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If an acceptance forms a contract, for common law say, </font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under common law enforceable contracts generally must indicate <b>PARTIES</b>, <b>PRICE</b>, <b>SUBJECT</b> <b>MATTER</b>, <b>TIME OF PERFORMANCE</b> and <b>QUANTITY</b>. Most express terms and promises are considered to be EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS, <b>except for TIME</b> of performance, buyer <b>SATISFACTION</b>, and <b>promises NOT TO ASSIGN</b> the contract which are generally considered mere â€œcovenantsâ€.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">If an acceptance forms a contract, for UCC say, </font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under the UCC a contract is enforceable if the <b>QUANTITY</b> and <b>PARTIES</b> are specified. Other terms will be provided by the GAP FILLER provisions of the UCC. All express terms and promises are treated as material terms under the PERFECT TENDER RULE.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>15.&nbsp;Was TIMELY PERFORMANCE a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law the parties may <b>agree at the time of contract execution</b> that <b>timely performance</b>&nbsp;is a MATERIAL CONDITION. Then the condition is called an EXPRESS CONDITION, and typically the contract says, â€œTime is of the essenceâ€.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">But material conditions may also be or <b>implied</b> when the <b>parties knew at the time of execution </b>that <b>tardy performance would deny the non-performing party the BENEFIT OF THE&nbsp;BARGAIN</b>, the benefit expected when they entered into the agreement. In that case the condition is called an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION.</font><br></p><p><b>16.&nbsp;Was Buyer SATISFACTION a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>Under contract law reasonably satisfactory performance by the parties is ALWAYS AN IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract. However, the parties may agree that buyer SATISFACTION is a MATERIAL CONDITION so buyers who are <b>not actually satisfied</b> have no legal duty to pay. </p><p>But if the terms of the agreement do not expressly and unequivocally state that the parties intended for <b>personal</b> satisfaction to be a material condition, the Court will generally hold that a promise of â€œsatisfactionâ€ was merely a â€œcovenantâ€ to perform in a manner that would be satisfactory to a â€œreasonable personâ€ and NOT a material condition UNLESS the service to be performed was one that is highly subject to personal tastes.</p><p><b>17.&nbsp;Does the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE bar evidence of other covenants and terms?</b></p><p>Under the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE evidence of PRIOR or CONTEMPORANEOUS agreements may not be introduced to VARY or CONTRADICT the terms of a <b>FULLY INTEGRATED WRITING</b> unless it is to show evidence of [DAM FOIL] Duress, Ambiguity,&nbsp;Mistake, Fraud, Oral condition precedent, Illegality, or Lack of consideration. The Court may determine the â€œcompletenessâ€ of a written contract by examining the comprehensiveness of its contents.</p><hr><p><b>C. Defenses</b></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>18.

However, the modification may be viewed by the Court as a WAIVER OF CONDITION that the waiving party has a legal right to retract, but the Court may estop the retraction of the waiver of condition to prevent injustice.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>21.&nbsp;Was the contract UNCONSCIONABLE?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>Definition:</b>&nbsp;Under contract law an unconscionable contract will not be enforceable because there is NO REASONABLE FINDING OF INTENT to enter into such a contract. An ADHESION CONTRACT is a â€œtake it or leave itâ€ contract that a party is <b>forced to agree</b> to, and it will often be found unenforceable.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>22.&nbsp;Is DURESS a defense?</b></font></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Definition:</span><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law only <b>good faith agreements</b> are enforceable. No contract agreement induced by<b> illegal threats </b>is valid. Likewise, agreements induced by <b>deliberate acts to create threats of economic harm</b> are not enforceable.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">You are unlikely to ever see a question that suggests threats of physical harm because the answer is too easy. But remember that a contract creates legal duties to perform so a threat to breach a contract is an illegal threat. Any agreement that results is the result of â€œeconomic duressâ€ and is unenforceable.<br></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>23.

Is ILLEGALITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law, a contract generally cannot be enforced by a party who knowingly entered into it for an<b> illegal purpose</b>.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>26. Is IMPOSSIBILITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law a material condition of every contract is that performance of contract duties must be objectively possible to perform. The inability of a contract party to perform is irrelevant, as long as performance, in general, is possible. But if performance becomes impossible because of events beyond the control of the parties the contract becomes void.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\">27. </span><b>Is COMMERCIAL IMPRACTICABILITY a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">A Court (a judge, in equity) has the authority to declare a contract void if <b>performance by a party</b> would be so <b>financially burdensome</b>, because of events beyond the control of the parties, that it would cause an injustice.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>28. Is FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under contract law, if the parties enter into a contract <b>knowing</b> that the <b>failure of some condition</b> beyond their control will <b>deny one of the parties</b> the <b>benefit of the bargain</b>, that condition is an <b>implied material condition </b>of the contract, the failure of which excuses both parties from the agreement .</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>29. Is MUTUAL MISTAKE a defense?</b></font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\">Under PEERLESS when both parties enter into a contract because of a <b>misunderstanding as to a material fact</b>, there is <b>no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€</b> and the contract is <b>void</b> from the beginning.</font></p><p><font color=\"#333333\"><b>30. Is UNILATERAL MISTAKE a defense?</b><br></font>Under contract law, when <b>one party</b> enters into a contract because of a <b>misunderstanding</b> as to a <b>material fact</b> the <b>majority</b> view is that the <b>parties are legally bound</b> to the contract <b>unless</b> the <b>other party knew</b> or should have known of the mistake, and in that case the contract is <b>voidable</b> by the mistaken party. Under a <b>minority</b> view the contract is <b>legally voidable</b> by the <b>mistaken party</b> in any event if they 1) <b>discover the mistake quickly</b> before the other party substantially relies on the contract, 2) give <b>prompt notice</b> of the mistake, and 3) <b>reimburse the other party</b> for any expenses caused by the mistake.</p><hr><p><b>D. Breach</b></p><p><b>31.&nbsp;Was there an ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</b></p><p>(If there is also a WAIVER of the breach, discuss both issues together.)</p><p>Under contract law an anticipatory breach (or anticipatory repudiation) is a <b>CLEAR STATEMENT OR INDICATION</b> that a party <b>WILL NOT PERFORM</b> future contractual duties when they become due. This is a major breach as to those duties, the non-breaching party is EXCUSED from performance of all remaining contractual duties, and the future duties of the breaching party are ACCELERATED to the present.</p><p>If a party has a <b>REASONABLE BASIS</b> to believe the other party may not perform future contractual duties, the party may demand <b>REASONABLE ASSURANCES</b> and <b>REFUSE TO PERFORM</b> until they are provided. Reasonable assurances generally means a <b>financial guarantee </b>or payment into escrow.</p><p> If reasonable assurances are properly demanded and not provided, the <b>failure to respond</b> constitutes an anticipatory breach.<br></p><p><b>32.&nbsp;WAIVER of the breach?</b></p><p>(Discuss if anticipatory breach is ignored by non-breaching party.)</p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under contract law if a non-breaching party lets the breaching party continue performance after a major breach it WAIVES THE BREACH.</p><p>The waiver cannot be revoked, and the non-breaching party is forever ESTOPPED from citing the breach as major and can only cite it as a minor breach.</p><p><b>33.&nbsp;Was there a BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT?</b></p><p>An IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract is that the parties must act in good faith and are bound by an IMPLIED COVENANT that they will <b>act as reasonably necessary to help the other parties enjoy the benefits of the contract</b> and <b>that they will not act in any way to prevent that from occurring</b>.</p><p>A breach of GOOD FAITH or acting in â€œbad faithâ€ means either deceit, concealment or fraud at the time of execution or else the breach of an implied covenant. The mere breach of an express contract promise, even if done deliberately, is not a breach of good faith.</p><p><b>34.&nbsp;BREACH? MAJOR OR MINOR? </b></p><p>(Realize the first party to breach a contract is the breaching party and after that the other party is the non-breaching party no matter what they do later.)</p><p><b>For COMMON LAW say, </b></p><p>Under contract law a BREACH is a failure to perform a contractual duty when it becomes due. A MAJOR BREACH is either an act which deprives the other party of the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN or the violation of an EXPRESS OR IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION by a party, regardless of its effect on the other party. A major breach EXCUSES the non-breaching party from all further performance of contractual duties and ACCELERATES the future contractual duties of the breaching party to the present so the non-breaching party can seek IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES.</p><p><b>For UCC say, </b></p><p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC any shipment of non-conforming goods is a breach of contract. There is no distinction between â€œmajorâ€ and â€œminorâ€ breaches.<br></p><p><b>For UCC DIVISIBLE CONTRACT SITUATION say, </b></p><p>Under the UCC a breach with respect to any shipment of goods under a DIVISIBLE CONTRACT does not constitute a breach of the entire contract. A DIVISIBLE contract is one under which goods are to be delivered in separate shipments which can each be evaluated separately under the contract.</p><p><b>35.&nbsp;EFFECT OF BREACH ON A DIVISIBLE CONTRACT? </b></p><p>Under the UCC a breach with respect to any shipment of goods under a DIVISIBLE CONTRACT does not constitute a breach of the entire contract.

But after a condition has been waived the waiving party has a legal right to retract the waiver. 39 Nevertheless, a Court of EQUITY may estop the retraction based on considerations of equitable estoppel.

Duty?</b></p><p>Generally a person owes no duty to others. But a duty may be based on a <b>Statute</b>, a <b>Contract</b>, a <b>Relationship</b>, the <b>Assumption</b> of a duty, or <b>Peril</b> caused by the defendant.</p><p><b>Negligence Per Se?</b></p><p>If a <b>Statute</b> creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute <b>Negligence Per Se</b> if the purpose of the statute was to protect the <b>Class of People</b> to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent.</p><p>Here D violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused P to suffer injury. But she was not in the <b>Class of People</b> the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people \"on national lands\" and she was \"outside the National Forest boundaries\". Further she did not suffer the <b>Type of Injury</b> the statute was intended to prevent because it was to \"prevent forest fires and injury\" while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.</p><p>Therefore, P would be unable to prove D was negligent per se.</p><p><b>Duty Based on Peril?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under <b>Palsgraf</b>, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the<b> zone of danger</b> caused by the defendant\'s acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant\'s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.</p><p><b>Definition:</b> Andrews held that if the defendant owes a <b>duty to anyone</b> and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.</p><p>Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because \"no one else was around\" and there was \"nothing that could burn\".</p><p>P appeared to be outside the <b>zone of danger </b>caused by D\'s activities because she was a \"half mile downstream\". P might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the \"gravel bar\" because D should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for P to prove that D had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.</p><p><b>3. Breach?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law a <b>Breach</b> is the failure to exercise <b>Due Care</b>. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances.</p><p>Here D went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone because he went to a \"gravel bar\" in the \"middle of the river\" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers \"carefully\".</p><p>P could only argue that a reasonable observant person would have seen the \"log\" floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than D.</p><p><b>4. Actual Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition:</b> Under tort law an act Actually Causes injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured <b>but for </b>the act.</p><p>Here P would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if D had not thrown the firecracker.</p><p>Therefore, D was the actual cause of P\'s injury.</p><p><b>5. Proximate Cause of injury to P?</b></p><p><b>Definition: </b>Under tort law Proximate cause means that the injury to the plaintiff was <b>foreseeable</b>, <b>close in time and place</b> to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a <b>chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events</b>.</p><p>Generally when there are tow or more actual causes of an injury, <b>the last, unforeseeable intentional act </b>will be an <b>Unforeseeable intervening event </b>that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting of all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are <b>presumed to be unforeseeable</b> absent additional specific facts.</p><p>Here P was rather far away form D in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further, a reasonable person would not foresee that&nbsp; firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if D was the proximate cause of P falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harry\'s criminal act was an <b>unforeseeable intervening event</b>.</p><p>Therefore, P probably could not prove D was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-09-28 01:34:38', 1),

However, through the backyard window, Tom was surprised to see\r\nHeather kissing another man.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Tom felt queasy and left. He went to the drug store and bought Anxiety-Fix, an\r\nover-the-counter anti-anxiety medication that he had never used before, and headed\r\nhome. Tom took three Anxiety-Fix pills, even though the instructions on the box stated\r\nthat a person should take no more than two pills every eight hours. Two hours later, still\r\nfeeling anxious, Tom took four more Anxiety-Fix pills, and fell asleep. Tom awoke in the\r\nmiddle of the night due to a nightmare he had about Heather.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Tom then lit several firecrackers in his yard, and threw them at Heatherâ€™s house. He\r\nwanted to wake her up to discuss what he had seen. Two of the firecrackers landed in\r\nthe toolshed, setting it afire. The sound of the firecrackers awakened Heather and,\r\nupon seeing flames, she grabbed a can of lighter fluid, opened some windows on the\r\nside of the house near the shed, and squirted the flammable fluid on the windowsills.\r\nHeather had been having a hard time selling her house and thought that, as long as the\r\nshed was going to burn down, the house could just as well burn with it since her\r\ninsurance would cover the loss.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Meanwhile, Tom used a garden hose to extinguish the fire in the toolshed before it\r\nspread.

The throwing of firecrackers,\r\nwhich are essentially a flammable and explosive device, should be known to a\r\nreasonable person of being capable of starting a fire. Therefore, the throwing of the\r\nfirecrackers themselves is dangerous, especially when thrown on someone\'s lawn,\r\nwhich may be flammable. Further, T was well aware that there were devices that used\r\ngasoline in H\'s shed, because T had frequently used them. Therefore, not only did T\r\nact recklessly, but he knew that there was even more reason to use caution because\r\nthere was flammable liquid, gasoline, contained in the shed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Therefore, T acted maliciously when throwing the fire crackers.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic\">Dwelling House/Structure\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law, the burning was required to be of a dwelling house.

The tools within the shed did burn, but the structure itself only suffered\r\nsmoke damage. Smoke damage does not constitute a burning because it does not\r\nactually char the building and further, this indicates that the open flame of the fire never\r\nactually touched the shed. Thus, T should be found not guilty of the charge of arson.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The state will argue, however, that the smoke damage is sufficient. Further, the fire\r\nmay have actually burned the floor of the shed, depending on how the shed was built.\r\nHowever, there are no facts that indicate that the shed had a floor to it. Therefore, it is\r\nunlikely that the state would be able to counter T\'s argument that the smoke damage is\r\ninsufficient to show a burning.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Arson is an inherently dangerous felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">However, for argument\'s sake, assuming the court found smoke damage sufficient to\r\nshow a burning, then T would be guilty', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-10-14 01:38:52', 1);

Since the offer did\r\nnot include a specified means of acceptance, the method of acceptance must be\r\nreasonable, and there are no facts that would indicate that a handshake was\r\nunreasonable. Indeed, since both offeror and offeree participated in the handshake,\r\nand offeror made no objection, it would seem that the offeror consented to that method\r\nof acceptance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The offer was accepted by the offeree.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Consideration\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Consideration is bargained-for legal detriment; \"an agreement to do what one needn\'t,\r\nor to refrain from doing what one may.\"\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the facts show that Dealer was going to transfer ownership of the handgun to\r\nBuyer, which she had no obligation to do but for the contract. Likewise, Buyer was to\r\ntransfer money to Dealer, which he had no obligation to do but for the contract. These\r\nobligations arose out of a negotiating, or bargaining, process, and constitute legal\r\ndetriment.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">There was mutual consideration.

First, a request to have the item inspected\r\nbefore purchase may not be sufficiently definite and unequivocal of a manifestation that\r\none intends to fail to perform their duties. Dealer will argue that Buyer\'s statement that\r\nhe \"will not pay ... unless\" Dealer did something he was under no obligation to do is\r\nsufficiently clear as to Dealer\'s intent to breach. Buyer will argue that his statement is\r\nmere grumbling and does not rise to the definiteness required to be an anticipatory\r\nrepudiation. Dealer probably has the better of these arguments. However, it seems\r\nDealer elected to demand assurances rather than treat this as an immediate breach by\r\ntelling Buyer that he \"expect[s]\" the Buyer to go through with the deal. Buyer then\r\nprovided assurance that he would perform, </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-style: italic\">before </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">he gave any notice of intent to treat\r\nthe anticipatory repudiation as a breach.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">To the extent that Buyer repudiated the contract, he cured that repudiation with his letter\r\nassuring performance, and Dealer will not be able to escape liability under a theory of\r\nanticipatory repudiation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defense - Mistake\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A mutual mistake is when, at the formation of the contract, the parties are mistaken as\r\nto a fact that goes to the essence of the bargain, and the risk of such a mistake was not\r\nplaced on the parties under the express or implied terms. Such a contract is voidable\r\nby either party.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, it seems that neither party knew the value of the handgun at contract formation.\r\nDealer was originally going to sell it for one tenth of what it should have been, while\r\nBuyer almost backed out of the deal. The mistake in the value of the handgun is\r\ntherefore mutual.

Buyer will argue that the risk of an antique being more or less valuable as a\r\nresult of learning more about the history of that antique is inherent in the transaction and\r\nnot a risk that the parties should not bear. Or, being that Dealer is a merchant, Buyer\r\nmay argue that the risk he created for himself by failing to exercise caution by\r\nresearching before selling, as he should have known to do as a merchant of antiques, is\r\nDealer\'s fault and Dealer\'s to bear. Further, Buyer could argue that Dealer\'s mistake\r\nwas not reasonable, as Dealer could have learned of the issue by doing some basic\r\nInternet searching as he later did.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Due to the nature of antiques and the Dealer\'s failure to research before selling, it is\r\nunlikely Dealer will be able to escape liability under a theory of mutual mistake.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Specific Performance\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Specific performance is an equitable remedy reserved for when money damages are\r\ninsufficient to make a plaintiff whole.

No amount of\r\nmoney can purchase a replacement of it, as the item\'s value is not in the metal the\r\nhandgun contains, nor in the cost to turn metal into a handgun, but in the historical\r\nnature of the item, and history cannot be bought.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The court should grant Buyer\'s request for specific performance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Other Remedy\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If the court refuses to exercise its discretion to issue equitable relief, Buyer may seek\r\nexpectation damages.

The facts suggest that the market value may be $20,000 due to the\r\nlisting price by the dealer and the 10x enhancement of value from the $2,000 original\r\nprice.

Modernly, acts for\r\nconspiracy are limited to crimes, and many jurisdictions require an overt act in\r\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1. The agreement: Here, it appears that we have two agreements: One between Arthur\r\nand Cassie to sell art from the gallery and then sell it, and one between Arthur and\r\nWoody to take and move the wrapped package from the gallery and put in into the\r\nbuilding next door.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a.

The facts\r\ntell us that Arthur and Cassie both \"wanted to make some extra money by selling art\r\nfrom the gallery.â€ Thus, it appears that both\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b.

Arthur paid Woody $500\r\nto take the wrapped package from the gallery, but it is not clear whether Woody knew\r\nthat such an act was intended to help Arthur and Cassie commit any crime. Since\r\nArthur and Cassie were art gallery employees, it may not have been immediately\r\napparent to Woody that they were working to commit any crime. Under majority rules, a\r\nConspiracy requires two guilty minds. Only if Woody shared Arthur and Cassie\'s intent\r\nthat a theft crime be committed, not merely acting as an innocent agent, will there be\r\ntwo guilty minds in this case. Under the Minority Model Penal Code (MPC) rules, one\r\ncan be guilty of a Unilateral Conspiracy with only one guilty mind. In this case, Arthur\r\ncould still be guilty under these facts. It appears likely, therefore, that a conspiracy will\r\nnot be found in these circumstances.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 13\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2.

This act would count under either above noted agreement.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4.

Trespassory Taking and Carrying Away: Arthur took and carried away (asportation)\r\nthe wrapped art when he handed it to Woody. Here, it appears most likely that Arthur, if\r\nhe had any possessory right to art at all, only had mere custody from his employer, the\r\nart gallery, to handle the art. This would make the taking trespassory. It does not\r\nappear that Arthur had any lawful possession of the art, but, if he did, the crime would\r\nbe Embezzlement as noted below.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. Personal Property of Another: The Wrapped Art was clearly the personal property of\r\nthe art gallery and not Arthur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. With the Intent to Permanently Deprive: Arthur had the intent to sell the art later on\r\neBay. Even if the art gallery could get it back later, the high risk that they would not be\r\nable to would still constitute the intent to permanently deprive.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Conclusion: It appears most likely that Arthur will be guilty of Larceny since all of the\r\nelements appear to be established.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">C.

Burglary: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At Common Law, Burglary was the trespassory breaking and entering of\r\nthe dwelling house of another at night with the intent to commit a felony. In Modern\r\njurisdictions, the dwelling house requirement has been expanded to cover all protected\r\nstructures (structures with a roof), the nighttime requirement has been eliminated, and\r\nthe Breaking requirement has been limited in favor of an expansion of the Trespassory\r\nEntry.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1. Trespassory Breaking and Entering: Here, it appears that Arthur waited inside the art\r\ngallery until it closed for the evening. At Common Law, this would not have constituted\r\na trespassory breaking and entering since Arthur appears to have lawfully entered the\r\ngallery when he came to work that day. By remaining inside after closing, however,\r\nArthur may have committed a \"Constructive Breaking\" in many jurisdictions.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Additionally, assuming that Woody is Arthur\'s innocent agent, the acts of Woody can be\r\nimputed to Arthur. Here, Woody climbed through an opening in the roof. Since the roof\r\nwas already open, at Common Law, this could not constitute a breaking. In Modern\r\njurisdictions, the breaking requirement has often been eliminated or severely limited\r\nsuch that a Burglary might still be found here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. Dwelling House of Another: At Common Law, the art gallery could not be considered\r\nthe dwelling house of another. Under Modern Law, this has been expanded to cover all\r\nprotected structures, structures with a roof, so this requirement would be satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. At Night: It appears that this event occurred \"after the gallery had closed for the\r\nevening,\" so most likely the Common Law nighttime requirement (after sundown) would\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 15\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Intent to Commit a Felony: At Common Law, a larceny was a felony, but under\r\nmodern law it is often not. In this situation, however, most modern jurisdictions expand\r\nthe felony requirement to include larceny and other theft crimes, so this requirement\r\ncould still be satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">5. Conclusion: It appears most likely that in a modern jurisdiction, but not in a Common\r\nLaw jurisdiction, a Burglary would be found. Arthur would also vicariously liable for the\r\ncrimes of Cassie in taking the painting directly after Woody did not show up. Depending\r\non the value of the paintings stolen, some jurisdictions would also consider Grand v.\r\nPetty larceny for this crime.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">E. Murder:\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Murder is a homicide committed with Malice.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homicide: A homicide is the killing of another human being.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Causation: Here, it appears that the acts of Arthur may not have directly caused the\r\ndeath of Woody; however, Arthur did set the events in motion that eventually lead to\r\nWoody\'s death and could be liable for his death here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Malice: Malice can be established in any of four ways: 1. Intent to Kill, 2. Intent to Cause\r\nSerious Bodily Injury, 3. Wanton or Willful Conduct., and 4. Felony Murder. Only the\r\nlast two could apply here since there is no evidence of any intent to kill or seriously\r\ninjure on the part of Arthur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3. Wanton or Willful Conduct: In order to have Wanton or Willful Conduct, the defendant\r\nmust 1. Create the risk, 2. Know of the Risk, and 3. Consciously disregard the high risk\r\nof serious bodily injury or death resulting from these actions. It is not clearly that Arthur\r\nwas aware of any risk to Woody as a result of his actions in carrying the package across\r\nthe roof to the other building, but it is clear that walking across a roof at night and\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 16\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">crossing between buildings possesses some risk of serious harm. In addition, Arthur\r\ndid not create the gap; however, he could still be said to have created the risk based on\r\nhis agreement with Woody to carry the art. Based on the above, it is also not perfectly\r\nclear whether Arthur could have consciously disregarded any risk he was not aware of;\r\nhowever, if he was aware, he seems to have disregarded it. It appears most likely,\r\ntherefore, that the actions of Arthur rose to the level of Wanton or Willful Conduct.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">4. Felony Murder: The Felony Murder Rule states that one who kills during the\r\ncommission of an inherently dangerous felony is guilty of murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a. Inherently Dangerous Felony: In most jurisdictions and at Common Law, Burglary is\r\nconsidered an inherently dangerous felony. See above for a consideration of whether a\r\nBurglary occurred. No other crime noted could generally satisfy this requirement.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Some jurisdictions also consider the manner in which the crime was committed but even\r\nthere it would be clear that walking across a roof at night and crossing between\r\nbuildings possesses some risk of harm and might still constitute an inherently\r\ndangerous felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b. During the Perpetration: Woody clearly died as he was carrying the art to the other\r\nbuilding, which was during the perpetration of (flight from) the Burglary if the did in fact\r\noccur.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Degree: If a Felony Murder was found to have been committed, the Murder would be\r\nFirst-Degree. If only Wanton and Willful Conduct can be established, the Murder will be\r\nsecond-degree.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Conclusion</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">It appears most likely here that a Felony Murder occurred, and Arthur will\r\nbe charged with First-Degree Murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 17\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">F.

Additionally, Cassie will be liable for Larceny/Embezzlement for the\r\ntaking of the paintings in the gallery directly after Woody did not arrive with the\r\npackages. We are also not told how Cassie \"went back into the gallery.\" If such an\r\nentry could constitute a Burglary, especially under Modern Law as noted above, Cassie\r\ncould also be independently liable for Burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">III.

Walter\'s\r\ninitial question is likely not an offer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">However, Betsy\'s reply to Walter\'s inquiry may be considered a valid offer if it is found to\r\ncontain the requisite terms. Her statement \"of course,\" in reply to Walter\'s inquiry likely\r\nindicates a manifestation of present intent to be bound as a clear and unambiguous\r\nstatement. It was made in conversation with Walter, so it is clearly communicated to an\r\nofferee. \"Get down here as soon as possible\" indicates a time for performance (as soon\r\nas possible). \"We can see where you would fit in\" likely indicates the subject matter\r\n(employment at Betsy\'s business). However there are two significant missing terms:\r\nprice and duration.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Modern courts are split on how to treat offers of at-will employment such as this.\r\nFollowing traditional common law rules, Betsy has indicated an intent to contract but\r\nhas not made a fully valid offer, lacking the essential terms of price and duration.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Acceptance\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A valid acceptance is an unambiguous manifestation of assent communicated in a\r\ntimely manner.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The facts state that Walter \"agreed\" to the offer, and further, that he would take\r\nimmediate steps to perform by giving notice at his current job and moving to South City\r\nby the end of the month. This is both an unambiguous statement of assent, and a timely\r\nresponse.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Therefore there is likely a valid acceptance if there has been a valid offer.<br>\r\nConsideration<br>\r\nConsideration is evidence of a bargained-for exchange of legal detriment or legal\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 27\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">benefit.

Depending on how a court views at-will employment promises,\r\nthere may be valid consideration.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Detrimental Reliance - Promissory Estoppel\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">This scenario is a clear case of detrimental reliance, a theory that allows a court to\r\nenforce promises that have not created a valid and legally enforceable contract.\r\nDetrimental reliance requires that i) one makes a promise with the intent to induce\r\nreasonable reliance on the other party, ii) the other party foreseeably and justifiably\r\nrelies on that promise to his detriment, and iii) unenforcement of the promise would\r\ncreate injustice.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">The theory of promissory estoppel is often invoked to estop one party from claiming no\r\ncontract exists as an excuse to perform where there has been clear detrimental\r\nreliance.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Walter will argue that Betsy\'s specific offer of employment, coupled with her repeated\r\nsuggestions over the years that Walter move to South City and work for her, were\r\npromises made with the intent to reasonably induce reliance. Indeed, it was\r\nforeseeable that Betsy\'s repeated suggestions and clear offer would foreseeably induce\r\nreliance on the part of Walter. Thus this element is met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Walter did in fact reasonably and justifiably rely to his detriment on Betsy\'s promise\r\nwhen he i) gave notice at work, ii) shipped his furniture to South City, iii) spent $5,250\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 28\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">on shipping and plane tickets, and iv) moved to South City. Thus, the element of actual\r\nreliance is met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If a court finds that there was no valid offer made by Betsy to Walter, a theory of\r\ndetrimental reliance can be used to prevent injustice and either enforce the promise as\r\nif a contract existed or provide Walter with reliance damages.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Statute of Frauds\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Certain contracts, including ones that will take over a year to perform, must be\r\ncontained in a signed writing to be enforceable. Since this agreement was for at-will\r\nemployment, which theoretically could be completed at any time if either party decides\r\nto quit or cancel the contract in good faith, this agreement is not covered by the statute\r\nof frauds.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Breach\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A material breach is found where one party has been substantially deprived of the\r\nbenefit of the bargain, has had commercially reasonable expectations frustrated, or has\r\nsuffered significant economic loss as a result of one party\'s failure to perform.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Walter will argue that he has been substantially deprived of the benefit of the bargain\r\nand suffered a loss of reasonable expectations and economic benefit when Betsy\r\nchanged her position and said she could no longer employ him since he took substantial\r\nsteps and made significant expenditures expecting to be hired. Betsy\'s refusal to hire\r\nWalter strikes to the essence of the agreement and therefore will be considered a\r\nmaterial breach if there is a valid and enforceable contract in existence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Excuses to Performance - Unforeseeable Event\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Betsy may argue that her failure to perform is excusable based on unforeseeable\r\nchange in circumstances.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 29\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Commercial Impracticability\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Commercial impracticability requires that circumstances not contemplated or reasonably\r\nforeseeable at the time of contracting have occurred, causing severe economic\r\nhardship to one party.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">As a businessperson, Betsy will likely be held responsible for reasonably foreseeing that\r\nshe might lose a major customer.

However, the current trend is to allow suits between spouses especially\r\nwhen intentional torts are involved. Thus, whether Wanda can sue Homer would\r\nessentially be a jurisdictional issue and a matter of law which the judge would\r\ndetermine. If the judge rules that no, spouses cannot sue in tort, Homer\'s liability will\r\nterminate and the directed verdict will be granted. However, this is unlikely\r\nconsidering the current trends allowing suits between spouses. Here, we will\r\nassume that spouses are allowed to sue each other in tort of both intentional tort and\r\nnegligence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">II. IS HOMER NEGLIGENT?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the question of negligence would relate to the burning of the house and\r\nwhether Homer\'s actions were sufficiently negligent in causing the\r\nburning. Negligence requires the finding of a duty imposed upon the Plaintiff\r\n(Homer), a breach of that duty, causation of the injury and an actual injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1.

A duty of care between husband and\r\nwife, as immediate family, is higher than the duty imposed regarding an average\r\nunrelated citizen. The duty to protect from harm is greater because of the\r\nrelationship between Homer and Wanda. Because the duty to not harm Wanda is\r\ngreater than the reasonable person standard a duty can be assignable to Homer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">2. DID HOMER BREACH THAT DUTY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">A breach of duty requires actions be committed by the Plaintiff (Homer) that\r\nplace others in unreasonable danger or heightened risk. Breach can be established\r\nvia statute (negligence per se) where a violation of civil or criminal statute imposes\r\nautomatic fault (which then, if the violation is a civil statute, constitutes a rebuttable\r\npresumption by the Plaintiff). Here, there is no negligence per se because there is\r\nno mention of a statute being violated. Breach can also be established through clear\r\nexplicit facts and/or the definable overt actions of the Plaintiff (Homer). However,\r\nthe facts here are murky. Thus, a third method of determining breach must be\r\nused--the method of res ipsa loquitor.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Res ipsa loquitor allows an inference of breach when clear facts supporting\r\nbreach do not exist. Res ipsa requires that the defendant be in clear control of the\r\ninstrumentality that caused the injury, that the injury would not have occurred without\r\nsome sort of negligence by the defendant, that no possible superseding acts occur\r\nthat would remove the defendant from the chain of control over the instrumentality,\r\nand that the plaintiff (Wanda) not have participated in their own injury.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 20\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">RES IPSA LOQUITOR AS VEHICLE FOR FINDING BREACH OF DUTY\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">a. DID HOMER HAVE CLEAR CONTROL OVER THE FURNACE?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the instrumentality that caused the injury (the destruction of the\r\nproperty, the \"house\") appears to be the \"furnace in their home\" that had \"stopped\r\nworking\". It states that Homer \"insist[ed] on attempting to fix it himself\" instead of\r\n\"call[ing] a licensed repair person\". There is no mention of any other person or thing\r\ninteracting with the furnace between the time Homer \"attempt[ed] to fix it himself\"\r\nand the \"burning\" of the house. This means Homer was ostensibly the last person to\r\ninteract with the furnace and a reasonable person could conclude that Homer had a\r\nclear control over the physical object of the \"furnace\" which ostensibly caused the\r\ninjury, \"burning\". This element is most likely met on its face since the \"furnace\" was\r\nwithin the purview of the \"home\" which would be interpreted to be under Homer\'s\r\ncontrol (dominion).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">b. WOULD THE INJURY HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT SOME SORT\r\nOF NEGLIGENCE BY THE DEFENDANT?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">This is a more sticky issue than the clear control issue, supra, which\r\nseems to be a straight physical-control-over-the-object question. This element\r\nfocuses more on the interaction the defendant had on the object in question.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">On first glance, it seems that since Homer \"having no knowledge of how\r\nthe furnace worked\" but yet \"attempting to fix it himself\" would infer that his lack of\r\nexperience likely caused improper repair on the furnace which then, according to the\r\nfirefighter at the scene, seemed to be the cause of the fire that \"appeared to have\r\noriginated in the furnace\". It appears on its face that Homer\'s repair led to the\r\nfire. However, could the furnace have posed a fire risk prior to Homer\'s repair\r\nefforts? Perhaps. Did Homer\'s repair in fact actually place the furnace in a condition\r\nthat would cause a fire risk when his attempt at repair would not? This is\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 21\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">unknown. The facts state that \"the furnace in their home stopped working\" but it\r\ndoesn\'t state what stopped working or why. There is also no mention of a defect to\r\nthe furnace prior to repair that would pose a fire risk.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Surface review would appear to assign Homer\'s actions as a direct cause\r\nof the fire. But, the fact that a firefighter (although ostensibly an expert in the field of\r\nfighting fires) making the statement that the fire \"appeared\" to have \"originated in the\r\nfurnace\" is not a direct statement of \"the furnace started the fire because it had been\r\nrepaired incorrectly\". This is probably a matter for an expert witness to determine at\r\ntrial. If Homer\'s actions did not cause the fire because the furnace was already\r\ndamaged and at a fire risk and Homer\'s \"repairs\" did not place that furnace in a\r\nhigher state of unreasonable unsafety then the injury of \"the burning of the house\"\r\nmay not be attributable to Homer\'s act of trying to fix the furnace and negate this\r\nelement of res ipsa loquitor resulting in no negligence. However, if this element is\r\nmet the other elements of negligence must also be met to find liability on the part of\r\nHomer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">c.

Intervening acts are those that occur that are foreseeable\r\nconsequences of defendant\'s acts and do not relieve defendant of\r\nliability. Superseding acts are those that are outside the realm of foreseeability and\r\nwould be those so out of the ordinary that they would relieve the defendant of\r\nliability. Intentional torts and criminal acts are considered superseding.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 22\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, we don\'t know what acts may or may have occurred between the\r\n\"attempt[ed]...fix\" by Homer and the \"home...destroyed by fire\" that may or may not\r\nhave \"originated in the furnace\". As discussed above, the exact cause of the fire is\r\nonly an assumption at this point, not a definitive statement of fact. Further analysis\r\noutside the fact pattern will be needed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">It is to be noted that the acts of the fire department in attempting to stop\r\nthe fire may have contributed to the \"destruction\" of the home. However, acts done\r\nduring attempts to rescue are foreseeable results of a \"fire\" by those public servants\r\ntasked with protecting the public, \"firefighters\". Even if actions by the fire\r\ndepartment are found to be negligent that will not release Homer from any potential\r\nliability since intervening acts of negligence are always considered foreseeable.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">d. DID PLAINTIFF CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OWN INJURY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">It is unlikely Wanda will be considered to have contributed to her own\r\ninjury, the \"destruction\" of the \"house\" by \"fire\". However, she did want to call a\r\n\"licensed repair person\" but was persuaded to let Homer fix the furnace instead\r\ndespite the fact that she (likely) knew Homer had \"no knowledge of how the furnace\r\nworked\". Was this enough to place some responsibility of \"destruction\" of the\r\n\"home\" by \"fire\" on Wanda? Perhaps. Again, additional facts will be needed.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Assuming the elements of res ipsa loquitor are met, there will be a finding of\r\nbreach on the part of Homer.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">3.

WAS THERE AN INJURY?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">An injury here would be the destruction of the \"house\" by \"fire\" which\r\nwould constitute property damage and thus qualify as \"injury\" for negligence. Pure\r\neconomic damages are not recoverable but personal injury and property damages\r\ndo qualify as \"injury\" for the purposes of negligence.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">DEFENSES TO BREACH\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homer may have several defenses to breach that would negate his liability\r\nand thus allow a directed verdict. The only two potential defenses are comparative\r\nnegligence and assumption of risk. Comparative negligence jurisdictions allow a\r\ncomplete bar to plaintiff recovery if that plaintiff contributed in any manner to their\r\nown injury. As above, assignment of responsibility to Wanda will be necessary to\r\ntrigger comparative negligence and bar her from recovery. A bar to recovery would\r\nallow a directed verdict for Homer regarding the negligence claim. Contributory\r\nnegligence, while a defense more often available in a majority of jurisdictions,\r\nassigns risk to plaintiffs based on their percentage of fault and reduces their\r\nrecovery accordingly. Here, only a finding of fault in excess of 50% on Wanda\'s\r\nbehalf (in Pure Comparative Negligence jurisdictions) or 50% or higher (Modified\r\nComparative Negligence jurisdictions) would bar her from complete\r\nrecovery. Finding Wanda at fault in excess of 50% or 50% or higher is unlikely and\r\nthus comparative negligence in both its forms would only serve to reduce damages\r\nwhich would then prohibit Homer from receiving his directed verdict. Assumption of\r\nthe risk is a defense that states a plaintiff is barred from recovery if they knew of the\r\nrisk and voluntarily assumed it. Here, there is no clear assumption of the risk of\r\n\"destruction of the home by fire\" by Wanda and thus she did not voluntarily assume\r\nit. This is not a defense.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 24\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">III. DID HOMER COMMIT A BATTERY AGAINST WANDA?\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Battery is the intentional volitional act of the defendant against the plaintiff\r\ncausing an offensive or harmful touching of the plaintiff\'s body or person (a\r\nconnected object suffices). The reasonable person standard applies when\r\nevaluating what is \"harmful\" or \"offensive\" contact.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, the defendant \"Homer\" intentionally and volitionally \"slapped [the plaintiff]\r\n[[Wanda] to calm her down\" which would be considered a harmful and offensive\r\ntouching of the body of \"Wanda\" when evaluated by a reasonable person. There is\r\na battery because Homer intended to touch her and caused a harmful and offensive\r\ntouching.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">DEFENSES TO BATTERY\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homer poses a defense to battery that his intent was \"to calm Wanda down\" and\r\nnot \"cause her alarm\". However, the reason behind the battery is not relevant, only\r\nthe intent to touch and a resulting harmful or offensive contact is needed to establish\r\nbattery. There is no defense to battery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">CONCLUSION: There is likely standing for the parties to sue; negligence on the\r\npart of Homer has not been clearly established with the facts at hand; Homer did\r\ncommit a battery.

(Flowers) built a large greenhouse facility in a rural\r\narea twenty miles outside of the city of Urbania at a cost of $20 million. Flowers\r\nemploys 20 workers. Because many of the plants grown in the greenhouse require\r\nmore light than is naturally available, Flowers installed a system to provide needed light\r\nduring normally dark periods. The light was extremely bright, casting a glow far beyond\r\nFlowersâ€™ property.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Flowers was successful in its business, but became concerned as the suburban area\r\naround Urbania expanded and as houses were built closer and closer to its greenhouse.\r\nFlowers decided to put up signs all around its property warning prospective residents of\r\nthe light created by the business.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry saw Flowersâ€™ signs when he was thinking about buying one of the nearby\r\nresidences, but figured that the light could not be that bad. He subsequently purchased\r\nand moved into an expensive new home, much like all the others in the area, on the\r\nstreet directly facing Flowersâ€™ greenhouse. After having lived there three months, Harry\r\ndecided that he could not tolerate the light coming in his windows 24 hours a day. He\r\nhas asked Flowers to turn off the lights, and Flowers has refused, arguing that its facility\r\nis completely up to industry standards, that there is no way to continue the business\r\nwithout the light, and that Harry knew about the issue when he bought the house.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\r\n						<li style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">\r\n							<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">What tort claims can Harry reasonably bring against Flowers?

There is\r\nextremely bright light streaming into his home \"24 hours a day\" and he asserts that he\r\ncan no longer tolerate it after enduring it for three months. He will claim that it is\r\nunreasonable because the neighborhood has become fairly residential and as a\r\nresidential neighborhood it is not reasonable to have light shining at hours that are\r\nnormally dark and that any reasonable person would be bothered by the intrusion.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Harry will argue that the extremely bright light interferes with the use and enjoyment of\r\nhis property.

The nuisance is not unreasonable, that the\r\nplaintiff came to the nuisance, and that there are measures that he can take to limit his\r\ndamages such as heavy curtains or shutters.

Nuisance is a type of harm where the D\r\ncauses substantial interference with the P\'s quiet enjoyment of their real property. That\r\nproperty must be in the P\'s possession or immediate right to possession.

The quality of substantial is not\r\nmeasured by D\'s conduct, but by how great the impact would be on a reasonable, not\r\nhypersensitive person. Would a reasonable person find this to be highly objectionable?\r\nHarry will argue that not only are the lights extremely bright and disruptive to the\r\nenjoyment of the property when they are on, but he would point out that their light is\r\n\"coming in his windows 24 hours a day\"!

In a rural area, as such,\r\nthat is an income to 20 people/families who live nearby which means employment for an\r\narea that will less likely have high employment opportunities such as a larger city.\r\nThose 20 jobs are important.

Furthermore, although there is a harm in the\r\nconstancy of the lights, Flowers will show that the lights are bright at the greenhouse,\r\nbut only put out a glow beyond their property. D will make known that they conform to\r\nindustry standards in their operation. P could always shut their curtains at night and\r\navoid the light. There is a value to the community which will likely outweigh the harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Alternatives\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Although, there is a value to the community P will argue that perhaps the company can\r\nmake modifications or adjustments that would allow the social utility, but help to\r\neliminate the harm. P is requesting that the lights be turned off. D could also turn the\r\nlights another direction or create barriers between the greenhouse and the residential\r\nareas of the town to minimize the impact on the P. D should show reasonable efforts to\r\nminimize the harm in order to continue.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">DEFENSES\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">Coming to the harm\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Generally, D may argue that P came to the harm if the harm existed before P\r\nencountered it. This is a type of assumption of the risk analysis. Here, Flowers had\r\nbuilt the greenhouse facility in an area appropriate for the factory. They built \"in a rural\r\narea twenty miles outside of the city\". As the town expanded and grew closer, Flowers\r\nthen put up signs to warn \"prospective residents\" of the light created by the business.\r\nGiven the efforts to build away from a town and the warning that Flowers put forth, then\r\nprospective residents, such as Harry who saw the signs, cannot say that he did not\r\nhave knowledge and awareness of the harm. He was warned and chose to voluntarily\r\nencounter the interference anyway.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">P will argue that although he saw the signs he did not fully understand the scope of the\r\nharm.

An injunction is an equitable remedy in which the\r\ncourt orders the D to stop doing something. In this case, P will request that the courts\r\nhave D shut off the lights that are causing the substantial interference. D will again\r\nargue that the lights are pertinent to their operation. Many of the plants grown require\r\nmore light than is naturally available and will not grow without it, which will impact the\r\nbusiness. They meet industry standards and should not be required to shut down or\r\nsuffer impacts to their operation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">D will likely prevail here.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Perhaps, alternatives may be sought as mentioned above in which D can help to\r\nremedy the situation by putting up lighting.

It was his\r\nintent to kill Adam. There is also the fact that Steve is a professional assassin. This\r\nmeans that he kills people for a living. He has done it before.

It is true that Adam\r\nresisted and put Steve\'s life at risk. However, because Steve was the initial aggressor\r\nand because his intent was to kill Adam, this defense would not be allowed.

Here Will certainly\r\nhad knowledge of Adam\'s murder because he requested Steve to do it. He also had to\r\neither solicit or assist in the target crime. Here Will solicited. He gave Steve the idea in\r\nthe first place. Lastly, some courts require intent that the target crime be accomplished,\r\nindicated often by a corrupt stake in the venture. In this case, Will initially had the intent\r\nbecause he asked Steve to do it. Also he had a corrupt goal, to put a business\r\ncompetitor out of business. At least at the moment of solicitation, Will had the\r\nknowledge of the target crime and the intent that it would be accomplished.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Merger--solicitation merges with either the attempt, the commission of the target crime\r\nor with conspiracy. In this case, Will will be found to be an accomplice, thus liable for\r\nthe target crime which was successfully accomplished. He will also likely be found\r\nliable for conspiracy (infra). So solicitation in his case merges.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Conspiracy--see definition supra--Will agreed with Steve that Steve would kill Adam. A\r\nmodern court may look for some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.

The murder of Adam\r\nwas the clear and unique goal of the conspiracy, therefore, Will will be found liable for\r\nthe first-degree murder of Adam, unless he has some valid defense.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 27\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defenses:\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Withdrawal\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Will would argue that he withdrew from the conspiracy before the actual target crime\r\nwas attempted and accomplished. In order for a withdrawal to be valid and to excuse a\r\ncoconspirator from the future crimes of the conspiracy, it is necessary that, one, the\r\ncoconspirator notify the other conspirators of their withdrawal. In this case, Will notified\r\nSteve. He said that he had changed his mind and that he no longer wanted Steve to kill\r\nAdam. However, in addition most courts will require that the defendant have thwarted\r\nthe success of the conspiracy in circumstances indicating a complete and voluntary\r\nwithdrawal from the criminal purpose. In other words, Will would have had to either\r\nsomehow stop Steve himself, or notify the legal authorities so that Steve would be\r\nstopped from killing Adam.

ALMA\'SCRIMES<br>\r\nAlma\'s Solicitation of Burglary, or In the Alternative Larceny, and Extortion, Merges with\r\nthe Target Crimes.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Solicitation is the act of requesting, demanding, or encouraging the commission of a\r\nspecific crime not already planned by another, whether they agree or not. If the target\r\ncrime is committed, it merges with that charge. Actual and proximate causation must be\r\nmet.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Alma \"asked her friend, Bob, a locksmith, to open a locked drawer in Ed\'s desk\" in\r\nEd\'s office for purposes of stealing confidential documents to use for her planned\r\nextortion. Causation is met because had she not requested Bob\'s help, the solicitation\r\nwould not have occurred. Alma is guilty of solicitation, but because the target crimes\r\nwere committed, it merges, and she will not be charged with solicitation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma\'s Conspiracy to Commit Burglary, or In the Alternative Larceny, and Extortion,\r\nDoes not Merge with the Target Crimes.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Conspiracy is the act of agreeing with one or more other people to commit a specific\r\ncrime or series of crimes with the intent to make such agreement where at least one\r\nparty believes there is an agreement (in most jurisdictions) and a co-conspirator has\r\nmade an overt act, including minor preparation, in furtherance of the conspiracy (again\r\nin most jurisdictions).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Bob agreed with Alma to break into Ed\'s drawer for Alma\'s extortion purposes when he\r\n\"said he would help her\"; Alma intended to make an agreement to commit a crime, did\r\nmake such agreement, and her actions when she took Bob to Ed\'s office meet the overt\r\nact and show she believed there was such agreement. Causation is met because she\r\nwould not have entered the agreement had she not asked Bob for help in the\r\ncommission of a crime. Alma is guilty of conspiracy.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 31\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma May be Guilty of Burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Burglary at common law was the breaking and entering of the dwelling of another at\r\nnight with intent to commit a felony. Today it is the entering of any structure of another\r\nwithout license with intent to commit a crime at any time of day, whether breaking or\r\nnot, in most jurisdictions. Both actual and proximate causation must be met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Alma and Bob entered Ed\'s office, a structure, without license, with the intent to\r\nsteal confidential documents, a crime. Causation is met because the entering of Ed\'s\r\noffice with such intent would not have occurred but for Alma taking Bob there, and the\r\nresult is not too remote or accidental, meeting both actual and proximate causation (as\r\ndefined by the MPC).\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma May be Guilty of Larceny, a Lesser Included Offense of Burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Larceny is the taking away by trespass of the personal property of another with intent to\r\npermanently deprive them of possession. Actual and proximate causation must be met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If not all the elements of Burglary are met, Alma may be charged with larceny, because\r\nshe and Bob removed the documents from Bob\'s desk. This analysis may be\r\nnecessary because Ed is Alma\'s employer, so entering his office may not have qualified\r\nfor burglary, if she had license to do so. Causation for larceny is met because the\r\ndocuments would not have been taken had Alma not asked Bob to help her take them\r\nand brought him to the scene where they were then taken. However, she certainly did\r\nnot have license to do so for the purpose of stealing documents, so the license should\r\nnot be recognized, and burglary most likely will be charged.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 32\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma May be Guilty of Attempted Extortion.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Extortion is a modern crime where possession or title of personal property or money is\r\ntransferred to the defendant by means of threat. Here, Alma intends to use the\r\nconfidential documents to threaten Ed with embarrassment, resulting in him paying her\r\nmoney. It is irrelevant that she believes he owes her overtime pay because she is still\r\nguilty of the attempt to extort payment by threat of embarrassment. Causation is met\r\nbecause she would not have taken the substantial step toward threatening Ed with\r\nembarrassment to get him to give her money if she hadn\'t entered his office with the\r\nintent to steal the documents for this purpose.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Alma is Guilty of Felony Murder if She is Guilty of Burglary, Because Diane\'s Death is\r\nForeseeable.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Homicide is the act or omission resulting in the death of another human.

Intent is either the conscious desire to bring\r\nabout the result or the substantial certainty that such a result will occur. Here, Abe,\r\nwhile holding his saw in front of him, took two steps towards Bill. Abe may have simply\r\nbeen proceeding with his plan to cut down the tree, and may not have had any intention\r\nwhatsoever to cause Bill any apprehension. However, because this was a\r\nconfrontational situation, a reasonable person would have had the substantial certainty\r\nthat his act would cause such apprehension in Bill; therefore the intent element is\r\nsatisfied. Bill took steps to avoid Abe, which shows that he likely felt apprehension\r\nbecause of Abe\'s act, and this would be reasonable under the circumstances as this\r\nwas a confrontational situation.

One method to determine if a duty is breached is to\r\ncompare the burden to avoid the harm and the utility of the defendant\'s conduct against\r\nthe gravity of harm combined with the likelihood of the harm. Here, Abe\'s burden to\r\navoid any harm was rather low, since all he needed to do was not cut down the tree.\r\nAdditionally, Abe may have been able to simply contact the local municipality and have\r\nthem address his problem with the tree. The utility of Abe\'s conduct is also rather low,\r\nsince his only benefit was the relief from having to rake leaves. The gravity of the harm\r\nsuffered by Cindy was great as she suffered serious injury. The likelihood of Cindy\r\nsuffering such injury was also relatively high, since Abe knew that Bill was in the tree\r\nand was likely to be injured, which would prompt a passerby to assist Bill. Based on this\r\nanalysis, Abe breached his duty of reasonable care to Cindy, since the gravity of harm\r\nand the likelihood of harm greatly outweigh the burden to avoid the harm and the utility\r\nof Abe\'s conduct.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">17\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 19\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Causation-- In order to be liable for negligence, the defendant must be both the actual\r\ncause and proximate cause of the harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Actual cause-- one test used to determine actual cause is the but for test; but for Abe\'s\r\ncutting down the tree, would Cindy have been injured? Clearly the answer is no, so\r\nunder this test Abe is an actual cause of harm. Another test used to determine actual\r\ncause is the substantial factor test; was Abe a substantial factor in Cindy\'s harm? Again\r\nthe answer is clear; Abe was a substantial factor in Cindy\'s harm. Under either test, Abe\r\nis an actual cause of harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Proximate cause-- Were there any intervening acts which caused Cindy\'s harm? Abe\r\nmay contend that the car which struck Cindy was an intervening act, but this act was\r\nforeseeable since the tree was caused to fall into the street. Therefore, this intervening\r\nact would not cut off liability. Next we ask, was the harm suffered by Cindy foreseeable</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">â€¢\r\n</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Since the tree had fallen in the street, and since Bill was in the tree when it was cut\r\ndown, it was entirely foreseeable that a passerby would stop to render aid to Bill. It is\r\nalso foreseeable that Cindy would suffer both the type of injury suffered and the extent\r\nof the injury. Therefore, Abe is a proximate cause of Cindy\'s harm.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Damages-- Cindy suffered serious injuries, so this element is obviously satisfied.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Defenses--<br>\r\nAssumption of the risk occurs when the plaintiff knows of the danger involved and\r\nvoluntarily proceeds anyway.

Cindy can claim that she acted perfectly reasonable under the\r\ncircumstances, because there was an emergency situation. Under emergency\r\nsituations, the actor is to act reasonably under the circumstances at hand, even if in\r\nhindsight it is shown that they did not take the wisest course of action.

In response, Foreman shut down the work site.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Foreman stepped away from the work site to call his wife. Just then Stephen, who was\r\nPatricia\'s ten-year-old son, came home from school and climbed into the excavated\r\nhole. As he reached the bottom, he screamed as soil caved in around him and he was\r\nburied. Hearing the scream, Foreman grabbed a shovel, jumped into the hole, freed\r\nStephen after several minutes of shoveling, found that his heart had stopped, and\r\napplied chest compressions to resuscitate him.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Stephen suffered a sprained ankle as a result of the cave-in and broken ribs as a result\r\nof the chest compressions.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">1.

Here, in order for Patricia to bring a reasonable\r\nsuit against Contractor she must be able to show that Foreman was an employee of\r\nContractor and that Foreman was negligent.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">In this case, Foreman worked for Contractor. There are no facts to indicate that\r\nForeman was an independent contractor. Contractor left him in charge of the\r\nconstruction site which included the authority to shut down the work site and make other\r\ndecisions in regards to the work being performed. As such, Foreman would be\r\nconsidered an employee of Contractor. If Patricia can assert that Foreman was\r\nnegligent, as discussed below, she will be able to assert a claim against Contractor for\r\nvicarious liability for the damages suffered by Stephen and recover from Contractor.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">B. Negligence. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Patricia can also assert a direct claim against Contractor for negligence.\r\nWhen one takes an affirmative act and fails to act as a reasonable person and a harm\r\nresults they can be held liable as being negligent. In order to assert her claim she must\r\nshow that there was a duty, that duty was breached, the harm caused was a result of\r\nthe breach, damages were suffered and there are no defenses.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">1. Duty</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">. When one takes an affirmative act they owe a duty of reasonable care to all\r\nforeseeable plaintiffs.

Under the majority\r\nview it is held that a duty of reasonable care is owed to all plaintiffs in the foreseeable\r\nzone of danger. Contractor may argue that Stephen was not in the foreseeable zone of\r\ndanger; however, even though he was at school the excavation was occurring at his\r\nhouse, and as such it is foreseeable that he would be present at some time during the\r\nconstruction as construction of a room addition cannot occur within one day of\r\nbeginning to completion. Therefore, Stephen would have been in the foreseeable zone\r\nof danger and was owed a duty of reasonable care. Under the minority view a duty is\r\nowed to all. Under either view, Contractor by beginning the construction owed a duty of\r\ncare to Stephen.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">2. Breach of Duty. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When one owes a duty of care, the breach of such duty must be\r\nshown in order to show that there was negligence. Here, there are two theories under\r\nwhich Patricia can try to establish that Contractor breached his duty.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">a. Negligence per se </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">- When there is a statute in place, that statute can be used to set\r\nthe duty and if that statute is not followed can be used to show that the duty was\r\nbreached. In order to show this Patricia must show that the statute was in place to\r\nprevent the type of harm that was suffered, and that the plaintiff was in the class of\r\npeople the statute was designed to protect.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, that standard was intended to protect workers from cave-ins. Since the statute\r\nwas in place to protect from cave-ins, which is what occurred, it was specifically\r\ninstituted to protect from this type of harm. However, it was specifically put into place to\r\nprotect workers, which is the class of plaintiff it is designed to protect. Since Stephen\r\nwas her son, he is not a worker, he is not in the type of class of people the statute was\r\ndesigned to protect; therefore Patricia would be unable to prove breach through the use\r\nof the statute.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">6\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 7\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">b. Reasonable standard. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When one is shown to have acted unreasonably then they\r\nhave breached their duty. Unreasonableness can be shown when the burden of\r\navoiding the harm causing activity paired with the social utility of that activity is less than\r\nthe likelihood that the harm will occur and the gravity of the harm suffered.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor left his employee, Foreman, in charge of the excavation. However, his\r\nduty was to ensure that his plans were such that did not pose a risk to either his\r\nemployees or the people that may be nearby the construction site. Being a contractor,\r\nhe should be knowledgeable to the statutes within the area and adjust his plans\r\naccordingly. As such, since it would take Contractor very little to be knowledgeable of\r\nthe accepted practices within the industry, as he has been in this industry, he owed a\r\nduty of care and reasonable conduct to ensure that his construction sites were safe,\r\nespecially since he left other employees in charge of the sites. If he can show that\r\nForeman acted outside of his scope and therefore did not comply with his instructions\r\nthen he can show that he did not act unreasonably and there was no breach of duty.\r\nHowever, if it is found that Contractor should have known of the risk and did not instill\r\npractices to prevent harm, such as here, setting up an excavation that is clearly against\r\nstatute, then he acted unreasonably and breached his duty of care.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">c. Causation</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">. In order for there to be an appropriate cause of action Patricia must show\r\nthat Contractor\'s breach of duty was both the cause-in-fact of Stephen\'s injuries and the\r\nproximate cause.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">i. Cause-in-fact can be shown here through the but-for test.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, but for the Contractor failing to comply with statute and conduct a reasonable\r\nexcavation that was safe, the hole would not have been in the yard and Stephen would\r\nnot have been able to climb into it and the cave-in would not have occurred.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">ii. Proximate cause. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">When there is a foreseeable, intervening and superseding event\r\nthat breaks the chain of causation then the person will not be liable for the harm that\r\nwas caused.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">7\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 8\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor will argue that there was. It is apparent that there was an intervening\r\nsuperseding event; when Foreman shut down the excavation, he left the hole\r\nunattended. This occurred after Contractor\'s breach of duty, which was the improper\r\nexcavation site. However, the question is whether or not this was a foreseeable event\r\nthat occurred. Normally a person will not be held liable for the tortious acts of a third\r\nperson; however, negligence on the part of another person is foreseeable. Therefore, if\r\nit can be shown that Foreman was negligent, as discussed below, then Contractor will\r\nnot be able to argue that he was not the proximate cause of the injury and Patricia will\r\nbe able to prove this element.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">d. Damages. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Damages must be proven in order to be able to recover in a negligence\r\naction. Damages must be legally cognizable. Here, Patricia will be able to meet this\r\nburden since she will be able to show that Stephen suffered a sprained ankle and\r\nbroken ribs.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">e. Defenses. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Under the common law, if a party was contributorily negligent they were\r\nbarred from any recovery. However under the modern majority the theory of\r\ncomparative negligence will be applied and the plaintiff\'s recovery will be reduced by the\r\npercentage of their fault. Depending on the jurisdiction, it will depend on whether they\r\nwill receive recovery no matter the percentage of their fault or if they will be barred if\r\nthey are determined to be more at fault than the defendant.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Contractor will assert that Stephen was negligent when he decided to climb into\r\nan excavated home in a construction area since it is unreasonable to do so. However,\r\nPatricia can assert that Stephen should be held to the standard of a child and not an\r\nadult, so he should be judged as a child of like age, experience and education and as a\r\n10-year old, he was not aware of the risk associated with the hole. A 10-year old boy\r\nnormally enjoys digging holes, climbing into them and exploring. As such, if he is judged\r\non the child standard, he will not be determined to have been negligent and Patricia will\r\nbe able to recover no matter the jurisdiction.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">8\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">II.

Breach. supra\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, Foreman had shut down the work site; however he had stepped away from the\r\nwork site to make a phone call to his wife when the injury occurred. Foreman will assert\r\nthat no one was home when he stepped away from the work site to make the call,\r\ntherefore there was no likelihood that any harm would occur and he was not\r\nunreasonable just to be able to make a call since Stephen had just come home from\r\nschool. However, since he was aware by the statute that the excavation site could cave\r\nin which could result in serious harm or death, when he left it unattended, it was\r\npossible for someone he was unaware of to enter the hole, as what happened here\r\nwhen Stephen entered the hole. He could have merely made his phone call by the site,\r\nor left it attended by someone or placed a barrier or warning up to stop people from\r\nentering the whole. This would have required very little effort on his part, and by the use\r\nof a barrier or warning or being present he could have easily prevented Stephen from\r\nentering the hole.

The elements of breaking and entry was satisfied when Ann broke a window in\r\nthe back door and entered the building. The building she entered was a dwelling\r\n(house) and it was not hers, it was possessed by Victor, therefore satisfying the third\r\nand fourth elements. It is stated that this occurred at night, satisfying the fifth element,\r\nand so all that is remaining is that she entered to commit a felony, in this case robbery\r\n(see below). Therefore, she can reasonably be charged with burglary.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Modern statutory changes to burglary often remove the requirement of breaking,\r\nexpand the types of buildings that it applies to, and no longer requires that the offense\r\noccurs at night. However, since this merely expands potential liability, the fact that all\r\nthe common law elements are met means that she would still be liable regardless of\r\nwhether the jurisdiction where this incident occurred had adopted modern changes or\r\nnot. Burglary is a felony.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(B) Robbery / Attempted Robbery / Aggravated Robbery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Robbery, at common law, required the following elements: (1) obtaining possession; (2)\r\nof personal property; (3) by way of intimidation or force; (4) from another\'s person or\r\npresence; (5) with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. Ann obtained possession\r\nof $500 from Victor\'s home, satisfying the first two elements. While she attempted to\r\nuse intimidation, she eventually succeeded by way of force, satisfying the third element.\r\nVictor was certainly alive at the start of the robbery, and regardless of whether he\r\ntechnically died before or after he died should make little difference because it appears\r\nto all have been in a matter of minutes. Considering that he died from her force and she\r\nimmediately took the $500, the fourth element should be met. She did not intend to\r\nreturn the $500, so the prosecution can contend that she intended to permanently\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">20\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 21\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">deprive him, therefore meeting the fifth element. Therefore she can reasonably be\r\ncharged with robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">In the event that she claims self-defense with regard to the actual shooting and that she\r\ndid not use force to obtain the money (and the intimidation did not accomplish obtaining\r\nthe money either) she could be charged with attempted robbery, because she intended\r\nto use intimidation to obtain the money.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Some jurisdictions have the crime of aggravated robbery which includes robbery with a\r\ndeadly weapon. If this jurisdiction is such, Ann would be charged with aggravated\r\nrobbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(C) First Degree Felony Murder / Homicide\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice\r\naforethought. When a killing occurs during the commission of a felony implied malice\r\nwill be found and the defendant can be charged with felony murder. One requirement is\r\nthat the death must be a foreseeable result of the commission of the felony. A death\r\nthat occurs in the course of a robbery will be found to be foreseeable, especially when\r\nthe defendant uses a deadly weapon to accomplish the robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law there were only a small number of enumerated felonies, any of which\r\ncould serve for felony murder. Modern jurisdictions have many more felonies than at\r\ncommon law and only certain felonies will result in first-degree felony murder (others will\r\nresult in second-degree felony murder). Jurisdictions following the Model Penal Code\r\ninclude kidnapping, robbery, burglary, arson, and rape. If the jurisdiction in which this\r\noccurred follows modern changes Ann could reasonably be charged with first-degree\r\nfelony murder. Regardless she can be reasonably charged with murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann might also be charged with some other form of homicide. She may be charged with\r\nmurder, depending on who pulled the trigger. It is unclear how the trigger went off in the\r\n\"ensuing struggle\" but if she pulled the trigger she may be charged with murder.

Ann struck a bicyclist while\r\nspeeding away from Victor\'s house. It is unclear whether this collision was accidental or\r\nintentional. If it was intentional, then all the elements are met--unlawful physical force\r\nwas applied to the bicyclist resulting in harm while accompanied with the necessary\r\nmens rea of general intent. Even if the contact was accidental, it may be found to have\r\nbeen unlawful because Ann was fleeing from the scene of a felony (assuming one was\r\ncommitted) and had not yet reached a place of temporary safety.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(E) Larceny\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law the elements of larceny are: (1) a taking; (2) and carrying away\r\n(asportation); (3) of property; (4) of another; (5) with intent to permanently deprive them\r\nof it. Larceny could be charged against Ann in the event that Victor\'s death prevents the\r\ncharge of robbery. If robbery cannot be charged, then Ann committed larceny when she\r\ntook the $500 from his house and carried it away with the intent to permanently keep it\r\nfor herself. Even if this property no longer belonged to Victor because he was dead, it\r\ndid belong to someone else (next of kin) and did not, according to the prosecution,\r\nbelong to Ann. Note however, that Ann cannot be convicted of both robbery and\r\nlarceny, as that would be double jeopardy. She can reasonably be charged with both,\r\nbut the jury can only find her guilty of one at most.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(F) Merger\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">At common law, misdemeanors committed in the same act as a felony merged into the\r\nfelony. Depending on how the situation is viewed, it</span><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">â€™s possible the battery could merge\r\nwith one of the other felonies.

However, when a\r\nperson is convicted of felony murder, the underlying felony merges with the felony\r\nmurder. Therefore, if Ann is convicted of felony murder, the underlying felony (burglary,\r\nrobbery) will merge with it and she can only be convicted of the felony murder.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Additionally, a lesser included offense merges with a greater offense. If Ann were\r\nconvicted of felony murder she could not also be convicted of another form of criminal\r\nhomicide. If she is convicted of aggravated robbery she cannot also be convicted of\r\nrobbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(2) Ann\'s Defenses\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(A) Defense to Burglary\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann\'s best defense to burglary is that she did not intend to commit a felony in the house\r\nof Victor. Burglary is a specific intent crime which means that Ann must have held the\r\nspecific intention to commit a felony in his home when it was combined with her act of\r\nbreaking and entry. Ann will argue that because the $500 rightfully was hers, she was\r\nnot breaking in to commit robbery. Regardless of whether she did or did not commit\r\nrobbery, she did not believe she was committing robbery, and therefore she did not\r\nhave the requisite intent when breaking into the house.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(B) Defense to Robbery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Ann\'s first defense to robbery is similar to her defense for burglary. She will argue that\r\nbecause the $500 rightfully belonged to her, she had no intention to permanently\r\ndispossess Victor of any of his property. This is difficult though, because what she was\r\nseeking to reclaim, money, is fungible. She had no way of knowing that the $500 she\r\ntook was her $500. Courts will generally disallow a defense for recovery of fungible\r\nitems. However, she still will argue that she lacked the intent to permanently deprive\r\nhim. Because she did not intend to permanently deprive him, she may be able to negate\r\nthe intent element of robbery.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">23\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 24\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(C) Defense to First Degree Felony Murder / Homicide\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Her best defense to felony murder is that she did not commit the underlying felony of\r\nburglary or robbery. With regard to another form of homicide that she could be charged\r\nwith, her best defense is that she was justified in acting in self-defense. While she was\r\nthe initial aggressor, she is able to regain her right to self-defense if the other party\r\nsuddenly escalates the confrontation.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If Victor had pulled out his own gun and she had shot him first, she probably would not\r\nbe able to claim self-defense. However, because Victor disarmed her and turned her\r\nown gun at her while stating an intent to kill her, she was justified in using self-defense.\r\nVictor was only allowed to use necessary force in his own self-defense and shooting her\r\nonce she no longer posed a threat went beyond that. By stating that he was going to\r\nshoot her, while having the apparent ability to do so (point the gun), that allowed Ann to\r\nregain her right of self-defense and to attempt to take the gun back in order to preserve\r\nher own life.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">(D) Defense to Battery\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Her best defense to battery is that she lacked the necessary intent. Battery requires\r\ngeneral intent which is that the actor knew that they were acting in the proscribed way\r\nand was aware of all attendant circumstances. She was aware she was speeding, but\r\nwas probably unaware of the bicyclist until it was too late to avoid her. Speeding could\r\nbe viewed as negligent or reckless. If it is viewed as recklessness, it must represent a\r\ngross deviation of a risk that a similarly situated person would take given the purpose of\r\ntheir conduct. Her purpose--fleeing the scene--would not be an acceptable purpose.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">If it is viewed as negligent, it must be criminally negligent which requires a higher\r\ndegree of fault than criminal negligence. Her ignorance of the risk must have been a\r\ngross deviation from what a normal person in her position would realize. Since many\r\npeople speed, it could be argued that this is not a gross deviation, and fails to rise to the\r\nlevel of criminal negligence or criminal recklessness.\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">24\r\n</span></p>\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div><div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 25\">\r\n			<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n				<div class=\"column\">\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'Arial\'; font-weight: 700\">State v.

When\r\nVictor refused to let her inside the house, she broke a window in the back door and let\r\nherself in. This is sufficient to constitute a breaking and entering by Ann. Also, the facts\r\nindicate that the home belonged to Victor; therefore, it was the dwelling of another,\r\nAdditionally, the incident occurred at a time when Ann drove to Victor\'s house in the\r\nnighttime; thus the nighttime requirement is satisfied. Furthermore, prior to Ann arriving\r\nat Victor\'s home, Ann formulated the plan to drive to Victor\'s house with a pistol in order\r\nto scare him into paying her $500.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">However, Ann will argue that because Victor owed her $500, she was simply trying to\r\nrecover what was hers to begin with.

This letter is a communication\r\nthat was sent out, so it is an outward manifestation. Further, Chip said that they \"will\"\r\nbuy the parts from the first manufacturer to commit to the performing according to the\r\nterms. \"Will\" is not equivocal language, it shows that Chip is serious about entering a\r\ncontract with the first to commit to the terms. Further, Chip\'s statement of the specific\r\nterms shows that it is giving the recipients the power to accept because they know what\r\nwill be expected of them - this is not an invitation to negotiate, but an offer to contract.\r\nAs such, this element is met.\r\n</span></p>\r\n					<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: \'ArialMT\'\">Here, re (b), the UCC only requires that the offer contain the quantity term.

Otherwise, only COMMON LAW governs the contract. </p><p>Here the contract does not concern a sale of movable things because it is for the \"rent\" of a \"house\".</p><p>Therefore, only COMMON LAW principles govern this contract.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 75</b></p><p><b>1) UCC?</b></p><p>Article 2 of the UCC governs contracts for the sale of GOODS, movable things at the time of identification to the contract.</p><p>Here the contract is for sale of a moveable thing because it was for sale of a â€œtuxedoâ€. </p><p>Therefore this was a contract for a sale of goods and the UCC governs.</p><p><b>Sample 3, page 80</b></p><p><b>1) UCC?</b></p><p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the sale of GOODS, movable things at the time of identification to the contract.</p><p>Here the question involves a sale of a \"car\" and it is movable because it was to be delivered.</p><p>Therefore, the UCC applies here.</p><p><b>Sample 4, page 84</b></p><p><b>TOM v. AL</b></p><p><b>1. Was the contract of January 1 unenforceable by Tom because it was oral?</b></p><p><b>1) UCC?</b></p><p>UCC Article 2 governs the sale of goods, moveable things at the time of identification to the contract. But UCC Article 1 generally requires a written contract signed by the party to be bound for any sale of personal property that is not goods in excess of $5,000.</p><p>Here Tom claimed the records were â€œgoodsâ€ but the contract was not for the sale of anything movable because it was for the sale of â€œrecording rightsâ€. But it was for a sale of personal property because it was for â€œexclusive recording rights.â€ The value of the contract was not stated to be over $5,000, and it might be argued that on that basis Article I would not require a writing at the time of execution, even though the song later became popular.</p><p>Therefore UCC Article 2 would not require this contract to be in writing, and it is arguable that Article 1 would not require a writing because the contract was not clearly in excess of $5,000 at the time of execution.</p><p><b>Sample 5, page 88</b></p><p><b>1) UCC?</b></p><p>Article 2 of the UCC governs contracts for the sale of GOODS. GOODS are movable things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise only the common law applies.</p><p>Here the contract does not involve a sale because it is a contract for personal services -- building a house.</p><p>Therefore, only the COMMON LAW applies.</p><p><b>Sample 6, page 91</b></p><p><b>1. What are Dottie\'s remedies at law relative to the stock?</b> </p><p><b>1) UCC?</b></p><p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the sale of GOODS. GOODS are movable things at the time of identification to the contract. Otherwise only the common law applies.</p><p>Here the contract is not for a sale of goods because it is an exchange of promises that Dottie will provide services and Fester will leave her his stock in his Will in exchange.</p><p>Therefore, only the COMMON LAW governs.</p><p><b>Sample 7, page 95</b></p><p>1) Does the UCC apply?</p><p>UCC Article 2 governs contracts for the sale of GOODS. GOODS are movable things at the time of identification to the contract.</p><p>Here the question involves a sale of \"widgets\" and they are clearly moveable because they were to be â€œdeliveredâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Article 2 of UCC applies.</p><p><b>Definition 2. Are the parties MERCHANTS?</b></p><p>Under the UCC a MERCHANT is a person who trades in or otherwise <b>holds himself</b> out by <b>occupation</b> or otherwise as <b>knowledgeable</b> about the <b>goods</b> of the contract.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 77</b></p><p><b>2) MERCHANTS?</b></p><p>Under the UCC MERCHANTS are people who deal in the goods or hold themselves out by occupation as knowledgeable about the goods in a contract.</p><p>Here Bob deals in tuxedos because he has a clothing store. Al may have \"bought a lot of clothes \" but there is no evidence he deals in tuxedos or hold himself out by occupation as being particularly knowledgeable about them.</p><p>Therefore Bob is a merchant and Al is not.</p><p><b>Sample 7, page 95</b></p><p><b>2) Are the parties MERCHANTS?</b></p><p>Under the UCC MERCHANTS are people who deal in the goods or hold themselves out by occupation as knowledgeable about the goods in a contract.</p><p>Here Sellco is clearly a dealer in these types of goods because it advertises them in its â€œcatalogue.â€ Buyco is by occupation knowledgeable concerning â€œwidgetsâ€ because of the large quantities it is ordering ($60,000).</p><p>Therefore, the parties appear to be merchants.</p><p><b>Definition 3. Was the communication of [date] an OFFER?</b></p><p>Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree such that an objective person would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain.&nbsp;</p><p>If ONLY common law go on to say,</p><p>At common law a communication was only deemed sufficient to constitute an offer if it specified the parties, subject matter, quantity, price, and time of performance.</p><p>If UCC say,</p><p>The UCC deems a communication sufficient to constitute an offer if it specifies the parties and quantity. The UCC provides â€œGAP FILLERSâ€ that may be used by the Court to determine any additional terms.</p><p><b>Sample 1, page 74</b></p><p><b>3) Was the ADVERTISEMENT an OFFER?</b></p><p>Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present intent to enter into a bargain communicated to the offeree and sufficiently specific that an observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. Advertisements are generally not offers because they usually fail to identify the parties or the quantity being offered.</p><p>Here the advertisement was not specific as to the parties because it did not guarantee that Lucy would rent to the first person to respond.</p><p>Therefore, the advertisement was not an offer.</p><p><b>Sample 1, page 75</b></p><p><b>4) Was the 9:00 statement by Homer an OFFER? Offer is defined above.</b></p><p>Here the statement by Homer did not appear to manifest intent to enter into a bargain because even though he said, \"I accept\" he added that he \"had to see the house first.\" No reasonable person would believe assent to that statement would form a bargain because it was clear he wanted to â€œsee the house first.â€</p><p>Therefore the statement was not an offer.</p><p><b>5) Was the 9:00 response by Lucy an OFFER? Offer is defined above.</b></p><p>Here the statement by Lucy did manifest intent to enter into a bargain because she said \"It\'s a deal. I will rent to you for $550.\" A reasonable person would believe assent to that statement would form a bargain.</p><p>Therefore that statement was an offer.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 77</b></p><p><b>4) Did Bob OFFER to sell the tuxedo?</b></p><p>Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree that is so specific that an objective observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain.</p><p>Here Bob manifested an intent to sell a tuxedo because he \"suggested Al buy\" the tuxedo. And a reasonable person would believe assent to this communication would form a bargain.</p><p>Therefore, Bob made an offer.</p><p><b>Sample 7, page 96</b></p><p><b>4) Was the catalogue an OFFER?</b></p><p>Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree that is so specific that an objective observer would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. An advertisement is never a valid offer unless it clearly identifies the QUANTITY of goods for sale and the PARTY to whom the offeror is willing to sell them.</p><p>Here the catalogue is not an offer because it is just a price list that does not specify the quantity of any product Sellco is willing to sell. No reasonable person would believe merely â€˜assentingâ€™ to the catalogue would alone form a bargain, so a catalogue cannot be an â€˜offerâ€™..</p><p>Therefore, the catalogue itself is not an offer.</p><p><b>5) 6/2/99 OFFER by Buyco?</b></p><p>Offer is defined above.</p><p>Here the communication from Buyco expresses present contractual intent because it says â€œwe hereby acceptâ€. The offer is specific as to parties because it says â€œweâ€ and â€œyourâ€, and it is specific as to a quantity of â€œ10,000â€. This is specific enough for an offer because it objectively appears assent would form a bargain.</p><p>Therefore, this is a valid offer.</p><p><b>Definition 4. Was the offer a MERCHANTâ€™S FIRM OFFER?</b></p><p>Under UCC 2-205 an <b>offer by a merchant</b> that promises to â€œ<b>leave the offer open</b>â€ for a <b>period of time</b> cannot be <b>revoked</b> by the offeror if it is stated in <b>writing</b>, for the <b>period of time stated</b>, or for a<b> reasonable period</b> of time (given the circumstances) if no time period is stated. However, regardless of the period of time stated by the offeror, the offeror can revoke within 3 months if that is less than the time period stated.</p><p>If the merchant promises to â€œleave the offer openâ€ for any period of time, whether more or less than 3 months, that is the â€œreasonable period of timeâ€ in which the offeree can accept the offer even if the offeror could legally revoke the offer sooner.</p><p><b>Sample 1, page 75</b></p><p><b>6) Did Homer have a valid OPTION?</b></p><p>Offer is defined above. Under common law an OPTION is a contractual agreement that an offeror will <b>not revoke</b> an offer for a <b>specific period of time</b> in <b>exchange for CONSIDERATION</b> from the offeree. CONSIDERATION is an exchange of promises posing legal detriment such that the law deems it sufficient to support an agreement.</p><p>Here Lucy promised to give a \"firm offer\", but Homer gave no promise or value in exchange. While the UCC provides for â€œfirm offersâ€ from merchants, the UCC does not govern here. Therefore, Lucy received no legal consideration in exchange for her promise to give a â€œfirm offerâ€ and her promise cannot be enforced against her as an option contract.</p><p>Therefore, Lucy\'s offer did not create an option contract, and she could revoke her offer at any time.</p><p><b>Definition 5. Was it an offer for a UNILATERAL CONTRACT?</b></p><p>Under the common law a UNILATERAL CONTRACT OFFER is one that unequivocally indicates <b>acceptance can only be manifested by completion of performance</b> by the offeree. GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, are always unilateral contract offers.</p><p><b>Sample 6, page 91</b></p><p><b>3) UNILATERAL CONTRACT?</b></p><p>Under contract law a UNILATERAL CONTRACT is proposed by an offer that unequivocally requires acceptance by performance and cannot be accepted merely by a promise of performance.</p><p>Here this offer unequivocally required Dottie to \"actually take care of \" Fester for the rest of his life because Fester â€œemphasizedâ€ Dottie could not accept by merely â€œpromisingâ€ to do what he asked.</p><p>Therefore, this was an offer of a unilateral contract.</p><p><b>4) SAVING DOCTRINES of a UNILATERAL CONTRACT?</b></p><p>Under the common law an offeror could revoke her offer at any time before acceptance. Under that view Fester could revoke at any time, leaving Dottie without a remedy. Modernly SAVING DOCTRINES have been adopted to <b>prohibit the offeror of a unilateral contract from revoking</b> for a reasonable time after <b>becoming aware that the offeree has begun performance</b> in acceptance.</p><p>Under an alternative view the offeror may revoke but the offeree has a right to RESTITUTION to avoid UNJUST ENRICHMENT.</p><p>Here Dottie began performance in acceptance because she \"sold her home\", \"moved\" and \"nursed Fester.\" And Fester was aware of her performance because he was alert despite his paralysis.</p><p>Therefore, under the modern savings doctrines Dottie would usually be given a reasonable time to complete performance. Here a \"reasonable time\" is the rest of Fester\'s life, since that was the condition of the offer.</p><p><b>Definition 6. Was the communication (action) of [date] an (implied) ACCEPTANCE?</b></p><p>If ONLY common law, say,</p><p>Under the common law MIRROR IMAGE RULE an acceptance is an unequivocal assent to an offer.</p><p>If UCC say,</p><p>Under UCC 2-206 an acceptance of an offer not otherwise expressly conditioned may be <b>made in any REASONABLE MANNER</b>, including a promise to <b>ship</b> or <b>shipment</b> of either <b>conforming</b> or <b>non-conforming goods</b>. BUT a shipment of NON-CONFORMING goods as an EXPRESS ACCOMMODATION is <b>not an acceptance</b>. Further, UCC 2-207 allows an acceptance containing <b>varying terms</b> to be effective.&nbsp;</p><p>Sample 1, Page 75</p><p><b>7) Did Homer effectively ACCEPT at 3:00?</b></p><p>At common law an acceptance must be an unequivocal assent to the terms of an offer, dispatched to the offeror in the manner required, or if no manner is required in the offer, by the means by which the offer was dispatched or some faster means.. An offer must be accepted before it LAPSES. Unless there is an option, an offer lapses in the time stated or if no time is stated within a reasonable time after the offer is made.</p><p>Here the reasonable time for acceptance of Lucy\'s offer is defined by the understanding that Homer would view the house in only one hour at \"10:00\". That understanding established the â€œreasonable timeâ€ within which Homer could accept the offer. But Homer was \"five hours late,\" so Lucy\'s offer had already lapsed when he arrived. Homer\'s attempt to unequivocally accept Lucy\'s 9:00 offer by saying \"I unequivocally accept\" was ineffective because he could not accept an offer that had already lapsed.</p><p>Therefore, Homer\'s attempt to accept was ineffective.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 77</b></p><p><b>5) Did Al ACCEPT Bob\'s offer?</b></p><p>Under the UCC acceptance of an offer can be made by any reasonable means showing assent to an offer.</p><p>Here Al showed assent by a reasonable means because he \" agreed\". Therefore, Al accepted Bob\'s offer.</p><p><b>Sample 7, page 96</b></p><p><b>6) 6/3/99 ACCEPTANCE?</b></p><p>Under UCC 2-206 an offer that does not clearly require acceptance in a specific manner can be accepted in any reasonable manner including a promise to ship or shipment of conforming or non- conforming goods.</p><p>Under UCC 2-207 an acceptance that includes varying terms is still effective. If the contract is between merchants the varying term proposed by the offeree may become part of the contract if the offer did not expressly require acceptance according to its terms, the offeror does not object to the varying terms within a reasonable time, and the varying terms are not a material alteration of the offer terms.</p><p>Even when varying terms do not automatically become part of the contract they may become part of the contract by agreement, and the UCC allows modification without additional consideration.</p><p>Here Sellco did not promise to ship in response to Buycoâ€™s offer because it said it \"could provide\" and not that it â€œwouldâ€ provide the product. The word â€œcouldâ€ does not imply any â€œpromise to shipâ€. Therefore the response of Sellco was a rejection of Buycoâ€™s offer and and a counter-offer to sell on different terms.</p><p>Buycoâ€™s reaction to Sellcoâ€™s offer to sell without warranty was an acceptance because Buyco â€œverbally agreed.â€</p><p>Even if one argues that Sellco accepted Buycoâ€™s offer with a varying term, Buyco still â€œagreedâ€ to it, so that would have modified the contract to exclude the warranty term anyway.</p><p>Therefore, there was an acceptance under either interpretation, and there is â€œno warrantyâ€ under either interpretation.</p><p><b>Definition 7. Did the VARYING TERMS become part of the contract?</b></p><p>Under UCC 2-207 an acceptance that includes varying terms is still effective. If the contract is between merchants the varying term proposed by the offeree may become part of the contract if the offer did not expressly require acceptance according to its terms, the offeror does not object to the varying terms within a reasonable time, and the varying terms are not a material alteration of the offer term.</p><p><b>Definition 8. Had the OFFER LAPSED before acceptance was attempted?</b></p><p>Under common law an offer LAPSES AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED unless it is accepted in a reasonable period of time. Oral offers are deemed to lapse at the end of the conversation, and written offers are deemed to lapse within the timeframe implied by the means of dispatch, absent contrary agreement or implication.</p><p><b>Definition 9. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?</b></p><p>Under the MAILBOX RULES of the common law an acceptance is effective when dispatched, if dispatched in the manner specified in the offer, or by the same or faster means the offer was transmitted where the offer does not specify a means of communication.</p><p><b>Definition 10. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REJECTION?</b></p><p>Under the MAILBOX RULES of contract law a rejection is effective upon receipt while an acceptance may be effective upon dispatch. An EXCEPTION is made if the OFFEROR CHANGES POSITION in reliance upon a communication of rejection, not knowing that an acceptance was dispatched prior to receipt of the rejection. In that case the rejection is effective upon receipt regardless of the fact an acceptance was also dispatched.</p><p><b>Definition 11. Was the communication of [date] an EFFECTIVE REVOCATION?</b></p><p>Under the MAILBOX RULES revocation of a contract offer is usually effective upon receipt.</p><p>Under common law a unilateral offer could be revoked at any time, and revocation of GENERAL OFFERS, reward or bounty offers, was effective when published in the same manner the offer was first announced. But modernly SAVING DOCTRINES prevent the revocation of a unilateral contract offer if the offeror is aware the offeree has commenced the requested act for a reasonable period during which the offeree will be allowed to complete acceptance by performance.</p><p><b>Definition 12. Was there an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT?</b></p><p>Under contract law an IMPLIED-IN-FACT CONTRACT will be deemed to have existed, even if there is no express agreement between the parties, if one party acts to bestow benefits on the other party reasonably expecting to be compensated, and the other party knowingly accepts those benefits knowing that the other party expects to be compensated.</p><p><b>Definition 13. Is a WRITING needed?</b></p><p>If ONLY common law governs say,&nbsp;</p><p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be written in order to be legally enforced, and one type is a contract for (pick one if it applies here -- MARRIAGE, more than a YEAR, LAND, EXECUTOR of an estate, GUARANTEE of a debt).</p><p>If UCC say,</p><p>Under UCC 2-201, a contract for sale of goods worth $500 or more must evidenced by a writing sufficient to show the existence of a contract and signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. But between merchants a SALES CONFIRMATION by one listing quantity will bind both parties if the receiving party does not object within 10 days.</p><p>Furthermore, the UCC provides exceptions for SPECIAL MADE GOODS, where there is an ADMISSION by the party to be bound that there had been an agreement, or where there has been PARTIAL PERFORMANCE of the contract (i.e. acceptance of some or all goods or payment).</p><p>Under UCC 2-209 contract modifications must be written to be legally enforceable if the contract, as modified, is for over $500. Otherwise modification agreements will be treated as waivers of conditions that can be always be retracted, unless the Court estops retraction to prevent injustice.</p><p><b>Sample 1, page 74</b></p><p><b>2) Is a WRITING REQUIRED?</b></p><p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND often requires a writing, but not leaseholds of a year or less.</p><p>Here the question involves conveyance of an interest in land because the alleged agreement was to rent a \"house\", but this appears to be a month-to-month rental.</p><p>Therefore, a writing would not generally be required.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 77</b></p><p><b>3) Is A WRITING NEEDED?</b></p><p>Under UCC 2-201 a contract for the sale of GOODS over $500 requires a writing. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are still using the $500 limit. Under the UCC a contract between MERCHANTS may satisfy the need for a writing against both parties if there is a sales confirmation indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other and the receiving party does not object to the representation of a contract.</p><p>Further, under the UCC there is no need for a writing if goods are custom made, the person to be bound acknowledges the contract in a legal setting or where a party has accepted payment or goods.</p><p>Here the goods are over $500 because the tuxedo costs \"$519.95.\" And Al is not a merchant as shown above.</p><p>Further, this was a \"ready-made\" tuxedo, not custom made, and Al never acknowledged the contract in a legal setting or accepted the goods.</p><p>Therefore a writing signed by Al is needed if the contract is to be enforced against him by Bob.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 79</b></p><p><b>8) Can Al raise the LACK OF WRITING as a defense?</b></p><p>As discussed above, Bob could not enforce the contract unless he had a signed writing from Al. No facts show that Al ever signed any writing to buy the tuxedo.</p><p>Therefore, Bob cannot force Al to pay for the tuxedo.</p><p><b>Sample 4, page 84</b></p><p><b>2) Statute of Frauds?</b></p><p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS a contract that necessarily takes more than a year to complete from the time of formation must be in writing to be enforceable at law. But if an oral agreement that fails to satisfy the statute is partially or fully performed, it may be enforceable at equity to the extent necessary to prevent injustice. To plead equity one must have â€œclean handsâ€.</p><p>Here the contract would necessarily take more than a year because it was entered \"two days before\" Al was 17 and it was to last until he was \"18\". That is more than a year.</p><p>Therefore, the Statute of Frauds required a writing even if Article 1 of the UCC did not. Al only agreed to the contract orally, so and the contract was not enforceable against him at law because it was oral.</p><p>Further, Tom would be unable to plead â€œclean handsâ€ because he appears to have taken advantage of Al, a minor, and to have lied to Deccra about Alâ€™s age.</p><p>Therefore Tom would be unable to enforce the oral agreement against Al at either law or equity.</p><p><b>2. Was the contract of January 1 enforceable against Tom by Al?</b></p><p><b>3) STATUTE OF FRAUDS?</b></p><p>The Statute of Frauds is defined above.<br></p><p>Here Tom sent Al a â€œsignedâ€ confirmation that â€œgave all the detailsâ€. And Al also has â€œperformed completelyâ€.</p><p>Therefore there may be sufficient â€œwritingâ€ signed by Tom that the Statue of Frauds might be satisfied.</p><p>Otherwise Al would probably be able to enforce the contract against Tom at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.</p><p><b>Sample 5, page 88</b></p><p><b>2) Is a WRITING REQUIRED?</b></p><p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for conveyance of an interest in LAND generally requires a writing, and contracts that necessarily must take more than a year to complete require a writing.</p><p>Here the contract is for building a house, and does not involve conveyance of an interest in land because Homer â€œalready ownsâ€ the land. And the contract can be performed in less than a year because it was to be completed before the â€œWinter rainsâ€.</p><p>Therefore, no writing is required by the Statute of Frauds</p><p><b>Sample 6, page 91</b></p><p><b>2) Is a WRITING REQUIRED?</b></p><p>Under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforced. A contract for transfer of stock is not one of them.</p><p>Therefore, no writing is required by the Statute of Frauds.</p><p><b>Sample 6, page 92</b></p><p><b>2. What are Dottie\'s remedies at law relative to the house?</b></p><p>The same common law and savings doctrines apply to the house as for the stock as explained above. But under the STATUTE OF FRAUDS contracts for interests in land must be in writing to be enforced at law.</p><p><b>7) STATUTE OF FRAUDS?</b></p><p>The Statute of Frauds is defined above.</p><p>Here the contract was for conveyance of an interest in land because the contract was for a â€house\" to be given to Dottie in exchange for services.</p><p>Therefore, the Statute of Frauds would require a writing, and this contract generally cannot be enforced at law regarding the house.</p><p><b>Sample 7, page 95</b></p><p><b>3) Is there a NEED FOR A WRITING?</b></p><p>Under UCC 2-201 a contract for the sale of GOODS over $500 requires a writing signed by the party to be bound unless an exception applies. This limit is being raised to $5,000 but many States are continuing to use the $500 limit.</p><p>In a contract between MERCHANTS the need for a writing may be satisfied by a sales confirmation indicating the quantity sent to one party by the other if the receiving party has reason to know the contents of the writing and does not object to the representation of a contract within 10 days.</p><p>Here a writing is needed because the cost of the goods is $60,000 (\"10,000\" at \"$6\"). But this is â€œbetween merchantsâ€ because both parties appear to be merchants, and the 6/4 sales confirmation Sellco sent to Buyco specifies quantity at â€œ10,000â€. That satisfies the requirement of 2-201.</p><p>Therefore a writing was needed, but the need for a writing would be satisfied by the 6/4 message, unless Buyco objected within 10 days.</p><p><b>Chapter CONTRACT TERMS</b></p><p><b>Definition 14. What were the CONTRACT TERMS?</b></p><p>If an acceptance forms a contract, for common law say,</p><p>Under common law enforceable contracts generally must indicate PARTIES, PRICE, SUBJECT MATTER, TIME OF PERFORMANCE and QUANTITY. Most express terms and promises are considered to be EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS, except for TIME of performance, buyer SATISFACTION, and promises NOT TO ASSIGN the contract which are generally considered mere â€œcovenantsâ€.</p><p>If an acceptance forms a contract, for UCC say,</p><p>Under the UCC a contract is enforceable if the QUANTITY and PARTIES are specified. Other terms will be provided by the GAP FILLER provisions of the UCC. All express terms and promises are treated as material terms under the PERFECT TENDER RULE.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 78</b></p><p><b>6) What were the TERMS of the bargain?</b></p><p>Under the UCC the subject matter, quantity and parties must be specified for a contract to be sufficiently certain, but all other terms can be supplied by the UCCâ€™s GAP FILLERS.</p><p>Here the parties are Al and Bob and the subject matter is one tuxedo that is to be \"exactly Al\'s size.\" Although price was not agreed upon that term would be inferred by the normal price for such goods. If $519.95 was the normal price of the tuxedo, it would be the price supplied by the UCC. The place of delivery was Bob\'s store and the time of delivery was agreed to be \"later in the week.\"</p><p>Therefore the TERMS of the contract were sufficiently certain for it to be enforced.</p><p><b>Sample 7, page 96</b></p><p><b>7) TERMS?</b></p><p>Under UCC Article 2 a goods contract is enforceable if quantity and parties are specified.. All other terms can be supplied by the UCCâ€™s GAP FILLERS.</p><p>Here the parties are specified as Sellco and Buyco. The quantity is 10,000 yellow widgets at a price of $6 without a warranty for delivery on 6/8.</p><p>Therefore the contract is specific enough to be enforced.</p><p><b>Definition 15. Was TIMELY PERFORMANCE a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></p><p>Under contract law the parties may agree at the time of contract execution that timely performance (by the party to first perform contract services) is a MATERIAL CONDITION. Then the condition is called an EXPRESS CONDITION, and typically the contract says, â€œTime is of the essenceâ€.</p><p>But material conditions may also be or implied when the parties knew at the time of execution that tardy performance would deny the non-performing party the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN, the benefit expected when they entered into the agreement. In that case the condition is called an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION.</p><p><b>Definition 16. Was Buyer SATISFACTION a MATERIAL CONDITION?</b></p><p>Under contract law reasonably satisfactory performance by the parties is ALWAYS AN IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract. However, the parties may agree that buyer SATISFACTION is a MATERIAL CONDITION so buyers who are not actually satisfied have no legal duty to pay.</p><p><b>Definition 17. Does the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE bar evidence of other covenants and terms?</b></p><p>(This is only an issue if there is a detailed written contract. This and the Statute of Frauds can almost never both be issues in the same fact pattern because usually the contract can only be either written or oral, not both at the same time.)</p><p>Under the PAROL EVIDENCE RULE evidence of PRIOR or CONTEMPORANEOUS agreements may not be introduced to VARY or CONTRADICT the terms of a FULLY INTEGRATED WRITING unless it is to show evidence of [DAM FOIL] Duress, Ambiguity, Mistake, Fraud, Oral condition precedent, Illegality, or Lack of consideration.&nbsp;</p><p><b>DEFENSES</b></p><p><b>Definition 18. Can LACK OF INTENT be raised as a defense?</b></p><p>Under the OBJECTIVE MAN RULE, there is sufficient INTENT to enter into a contract if an objective observer listening to the parties would have reasonably concluded from their communications that assent would form a bargain.</p><p><b>Definition 19. Is LACK OF CONSIDERATION a defense?</b></p><p>Under contract law every valid contract, and any modification of a contract, must be supported by CONSIDERATION, a BARGAINED FOR exchange posing sufficient LEGAL DETRIMENT that the law will enforce the agreement.</p><p><b>Sample 5, page 88</b></p><p>3) MODIFICATION without CONSIDERATION?</p><p>Under COMMON LAW a contract modification must be supported by CONSIDERATION, a bargained for exchange of value posing legal detriment sufficient to enforce the modification at law.</p><p>Here the contract was modified because Homer promised to pay $30,000 more. But Bill did not give anything of value in exchange for that promise since he only agreed to do what he already had a PRE-EXISTING DUTY to do -- to build the house for $100,000.</p><p>Therefore, the modification of the contract was not supported by consideration and it is unenforceable at law against Homer.</p><p><b>Definition 20. Was the need for a WRITING SATISFIED?</b></p><p>(This second visit to the Statute of Frauds is only necessary if you did not settle the issue completely at the beginning of the essay OR there has been a contract modification.)</p><p>Under UCC 2-209 contract modifications do not require consideration, but if a contract as modified would have to be supported by a sufficient writing under UCC 2-201, and the modification is not supported by a writing, it is not enforceable at law.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Definition 21. Was the contract UNCONSCIONABLE?</b><br></p><p>Under contract law an unconscionable contract will not be enforceable because there is NO REASONABLE FINDING OF INTENT to enter into such a contract. An ADHESION CONTRACT is a â€œtake it or leave itâ€ contract that a party is forced to agree to, and it will often be found unenforceable.</p><p><b>Definition 22. Is DURESS a defense?</b><br></p><p>Under contract law only good faith agreements are enforceable. No contract agreement induced by illegal threats is valid. Likewise, agreements induced by deliberate acts to create threats of economic harm are not enforceable.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 23. Is FRAUD (or DECEIT) a defense?</b><br></p><p>Under contract law a contract induced through deliberate CONCEALMENT of material facts by a party with a duty to reveal the facts, or by a party deliberately concealing and/or MISREPRESENTING material facts is unenforceable if it can be shown the party seeking to void the contract would never have agreed to the bargain but for the concealment and/or misrepresentation.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Sample 4, page 85</b></p><p><b>AL v. DECCRA</b></p><p><b>3. Was the contract of March 1 enforceable by Al against Deccra?</b></p><p><b>5) FRAUD?</b></p><p>Under contract law FRAUD is a defense to enforcement of a contract where a party 1) deliberately misrepresented material facts, 2) the party raising the defense reasonably relied on the misrepresentations, and 3) the party to be bound would not have entered into the contract but for the misrepresentation.</p><p>Here Tom deliberately misrepresented facts because he said Al was \"19\" knowing that Al was a minor. And this was a material fact since it represented Al had legal capacity to enter into a contract. And Decca reasonably relied on Tom\'s misrepresentation, and could probably prove it would not have entered the contract had it known the truth.</p><p>Therefore, the contract of March 1 was unenforceable against Deccra.</p><p><b>24. Is INCAPACITY a defense?</b></p><p>Under contract law a contract cannot be enforced AGAINST one who lacks capacity. EXCEPTIONS are contracts for provision of NECESSITIES of life.</p><p><b>Sample 4, page 85</b></p><p><b>4) Enforceable by a MINOR?</b></p><p>Under contract law a contract, except for necessities of life, cannot be enforced at law against a party which lacked legal capacity at the time of execution. But if a legal incapacity is removed the party to be bound must repudiate the contract within a reasonable period of time or they will be deemed to have affirmed or ratified it. The period of time in which a party gaining legal capacity must repudiate a contract may be set by statue.</p><p>A party lacking capacity can enforce a contract against a party that does not lack capacity.</p><p>Here Al lacked capacity at the time of execution because it was â€œtwo days before his seventeenth birthdayâ€. But that does not prevent Al from enforcing the contract against Tom who did not lack capacity.</p><p>Therefore the contract is enforceable by Al, even though he is a minor.</p><p><b>Sample 4, page 86</b></p><p><b>4. ISSUE -- Was the contract of April 1 enforceable by Deccra against Al? </b></p><p><b>6) EFFECTIVE REPUDIATION OF CONTRACT?</b></p><p>As explained above a contract, except for necessities of life, cannot be enforced against a party lacking legal capacity at the time of execution. But if a party lacking capacity at the time of contract gains capacity, they must affirmatively repudiate the contract within a reasonable period of time, or within the time set by statute, or they will be deemed to have affirmed or ratified the contract.</p><p>Here Al lacked capacity to contract at the time of execution because he was a minor who was \"only 17\".</p><p>Al later attempted to repudiate the contract \"six months after becoming an adult.\" He would argue that this was within a â€œreasonableâ€ time after he gained capacity. And if this was within the statutory time period the repudiation was effective. Otherwise the contract may have been deemed automatically affirmed and the repudiation would be ineffective.</p><p>If the repudiation was effective, Decca would generally be required to give to Al all money it had made on the sale of his song.</p><p>Therefore, Deccra cannot enforce the contract if Al\'s repudiation was effective.</p><p><b>Definition 25. Is ILLEGALITY a defense?</b></p><p>Under contract law, a contract generally cannot be enforced by a party who knowingly entered into it for an illegal purpose.</p><p><b>Definition 26. Is IMPOSSIBILITY a defense?</b></p><p>Under contract law a material condition of every contract is that performance of contract duties must be objectively possible to perform. The inability of a contract party to perform is irrelevant, as long as performance, in general, is possible. But if performance becomes impossible because of events beyond the control of the parties the contract becomes void.</p><p><b>Sample 5, page 89</b></p><p><b>5) Defense of IMPOSSIBILITY?</b></p><p>Under contract law the defense of IMPOSSIBILITY excuses a breach where the performance of a contract has become impossible due to events beyond the control of the parties. Impossibility means that performance is physically impossible, and it constitutes a failure of an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of the agreement.</p><p>Here finishing the house was not impossible because Homer finished it by hiring Paul. Therefore, Wanda cannot claim impossibility as a defense.</p><p><b>Definition 27. Is COMMERCIAL IMPRACTICABILITY a defense?</b></p><p>A Court (a judge, in equity) has the authority to declare a contract void if performance by a party would be so financially burdensome, because of events beyond the control of the parties, that it would cause an injustice.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 28. Is FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE a defense?</b><br></p><p>Under contract law, if the parties enter into a contract knowing that the <b>failure of some condition</b> beyond their control will <b>deny</b> one of the parties the benefit of the bargain, that condition is an implied <b>material condition </b>of the contract, the <b>failure of which excuses both parties</b> from the agreement .</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 79</b></p><p><b>9) FRUSTRATION OF PURPOSE?</b></p><p>Under contract law, if the parties enter into a contract knowing that the failure of some condition beyond their control will deny one of the parties the benefit of the bargain, that condition is an implied material condition of the contract, the failure of which excuses both parties from the agreement.</p><p>Here Bob knew that if the wedding of Alâ€™s daughter was cancelled it would deny Al the benefit of the bargain because he wanted the tuxedo to â€œwear to the wedding.â€</p><p>Therefore, Al can claim frustration of purpose excuses him from the contract.</p><p><b>Definition 29. Is MUTUAL MISTAKE a defense?</b></p><p>Under PEERLESS when both parties enter into a contract because of a misunderstanding as to a material fact, there is no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€ and the contract is void from the beginning.</p><p><b>Definition 30. Is UNILATERAL MISTAKE a defense?</b></p><p>Under contract law, when one party enters into a contract because of a misunderstanding as to a material fact the majority view is that the parties are legally bound to the contract unless the other party knew or should have known of the mistake, and in that case the contract is voidable by the mistaken party. Under a minority view the contract is legally voidable by the mistaken party in any event if they 1) discover the mistake quickly before the other party substantially relies on the contract, 2) give prompt notice of the mistake, and 3) reimburse the other party for any expenses caused by the mistake.</p><p><b>BREACH</b></p><p><b>Definition 31. Was there an ANTICIPATORY BREACH?</b></p><p>Under contract law an anticipatory breach (or anticipatory repudiation) is a CLEAR STATEMENT OR INDICATION that a party WILL NOT PERFORM future contractual duties when they become due. This is a major breach as to those duties, the non-breaching party is EXCUSED from performance of all remaining contractual duties, and the future duties of the breaching party are ACCELERATED to the present.</p><p>If a party has a REASONABLE BASIS to believe the other party may not perform future contractual duties, the party may demand REASONABLE ASSURANCES and REFUSE TO PERFORM until they are provided. Reasonable assurances generally means a financial guarantee or payment into escrow.</p><p>If reasonable assurances are properly demanded and not provided, the failure to respond constitutes an anticipatory breach.</p><p><b>Definition 32. WAIVER of the breach?</b></p><p>Under contract law if a non-breaching party lets the breaching party continue performance after a major breach it WAIVES THE BREACH. The waiver cannot be revoked, and the non-breaching party is forever ESTOPPED from citing the breach as major and can only cite it as a minor breach.</p><p><b>Definition 33. Was there a BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT?</b></p><p>An IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract is that the parties must act in good faith and are bound by an IMPLIED COVENANT that they will act as reasonably necessary to help the other parties enjoy the benefits of the contract and that they will not act in any way to prevent that from occurring.</p><p><b>Sample 6, page 92</b></p><p><b>5) BREACH OF IMPLIED COVENANT?</b></p><p>Under contract law an IMPLIED COVENANT by each party to a contract is that they will not act to prevent the other party from performing contract duties and they will take reasonable steps to assure the other party enjoys the expected benefit of the bargain. Performance of this implied covenant is an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION of every contract,</p><p>Here Fester breached the implied covenant because he denied Dottie the opportunity to complete performance in acceptance. This caused a failure of an implied material condition because it totally denied her any of the benefits she expected from the contract.</p><p>Therefore, Dottie can claim a MAJOR BREACH by Fester.</p><p><b>Definition 34. BREACH? MAJOR OR MINOR?</b></p><p>Realize the first party to breach a contract is the breaching</p><p>party and after that the other party is the non-breaching party no matter what they do later.</p><p>For COMMON LAW say,<br></p><p>Under contract law a BREACH is a failure to perform a contractual duty when it becomes due. A MAJOR BREACH is either an act which deprives the other party of the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN or the violation of an EXPRESS OR IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION by a party, regardless of its effect on the other party. A major breach EXCUSES the non-breaching party from all further performance of contractual duties and ACCELERATES the future contractual duties of the breaching party to the present so the non-breaching party can seek IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES.</p><p>For UCC say,<br></p><p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC any shipment of non-conforming goods is a breach of contract. There is no distinction between â€œmajorâ€ and â€œminorâ€ breaches.</p><p>For UCC DIVISIBLE CONTRACT SITUATION say,<br></p><p>Under the UCC a breach with respect to any shipment of goods under a DIVISIBLE CONTRACT does not constitute a breach of the entire contract. A DIVISIBLE contract is one under which goods are to be delivered in separate shipments which can each be evaluated separately under the contract.</p><p><b>Sample 2, page 78</b><br></p><p><b>7) BREACH?</b></p><p>Under the UCC PERFECT TENDER RULE goods must be delivered exactly as ordered. A seller that gives notice of intent to CURE a shipment of non-conforming goods has a right to cure within the contract period and a right to extra time to cure if non-conforming goods were delivered with a reasonable belief they were suitable for the buyer\'s needs.</p><p>Here Bob delivered non-conforming goods because the tuxedo was not an \"exact fit\" as promised. Bob gave notice of intent to cure, and had time within the contract period to cure the lack of fit.</p><p>Therefore, Bob breached, but had a right to cure the breach.<br></p><p>Was the contract MODIFIED to a higher price?<br></p><p>Under the UCC a modification of a contract by agreement between the parties does not require additional consideration.<br></p><p>Here Al did not agree to pay a higher price because he only \"nodded\" agreement to the need for alterations. The alterations were so that Bob could cure his breach, and while Bob has a right to cure his breach, he has no right to charge Al for the alterations. Further, Al did not agree to modify the original contract terms.</p><p>Therefore, the contract was not modified to a higher price.</p><p>__________<br></p><p><b>Sample 5, page 89</b><br></p><p><b>6) BREACH?</b></p><p>Under contract law a BREACH is a failure to perform contractual duties when they become due. A MAJOR BREACH is one which denies the non-breaching party the EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN. A major breach completely excuses the non-breaching party from any further obligation under the contract. A MINOR BREACH is one where the breaching party has SUBSTANTIALLY PERFORMED. When there is a minor breach the non-breaching party must perform contractual duties but is entitled to an OFFSET as compensation for damages.</p><p>Here there was substantial performance because the home was all done \"except for the painting\". The minor breach cost Homer an additional $10,000, so he was entitled to an OFFSET in that amount.</p><p>Therefore, Homer must pay Wanda the contract price less an offset of $10,000, a net payment of $90,000.</p><p><b>Sample 7, page 96</b></p><p><b>8) BREACH?</b></p><p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC goods must be supplied exactly as ordered. Any non-conforming delivery is a major breach.</p><p>A seller that delivers non-conforming goods has a right to GIVE NOTICE of intent to cure, and may CURE the shipment of non-conforming goods at any time within the contract period. Further, the seller gets a reasonable amount of extra time beyond the contract period if the original shipment was sent with a reasonable belief it would satisfy the buyer\'s needs.</p><p>Here Sellco shipped non-conforming goods because it shipped \"blue widgets\". They were not sent with a reasonable belief they would satisfy the buyerâ€™s needs because they were sent by \" mistake\". And there is no time left to cure in the contract period because the shipment was on the deadline of \"6/8/99â€, and</p><p>Therefore, Sellco breached by shipping non-conforming goods, and has no time left to cure.</p><p><b>Definition 35. EFFECT OF BREACH ON A DIVISIBLE CONTRACT?</b><br></p><p>Under the UCC a breach with respect to any shipment of goods under a DIVISIBLE CONTRACT does not constitute a breach of the entire contract.

The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary.</p><p>A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of a debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary vests upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract.</p><p>Here the purpose of the contract is to benefit Chico because he was to get a \"new Dodge\" as a \"birthday present.\" Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is an intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a \"birthday present.\"</p><p>Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to \"deliver\" the car in \"two weeks.\" Harpo is the promisor because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico.</p><p>Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it.</p><p><b>3) Groucho\'s REMEDIES?</b></p><p>Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price.</p><p>Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.</p><p>Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000.

If the contract of April 1 is legally unenforceable by Deccra, what equitable argument might it make?</b></p><p><b>7) PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</b></p><p>Under the doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL a party can seek enforcement of an otherwise unenforceable promise where 1) a party made a <b>promise</b>, 2) intending to <b>induce reliance</b>, 3) there was <b>reasonable reliance</b> by the other party and 4) injustice will result if the promise is not enforced..</p><p>Here Al made a promise to Deccra because he â€œagreed on April 1 to a new arrangementâ€, and he did that intending to induce reliance.</p><p>Al would argue that Decca did not reasonably rely because it was aware Al was a minor and could repudiate the contract at any time. Deccra would argue that Al would reap an UNJUST ENRICHMENT because it incurred \"$360,000 in distribution expense.\"</p><p>Therefore, it would appear that Decca\'s restitution to Al should be reduced by this amount and restricted to the actual profit made by Decca.</p><p><b>Sample 5, page 89</b></p><p><b>4) Enforceable by PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</b></p><p>Under the theory of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL an agreement that otherwise is unenforceable at law for a lack of consideration may be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.

Promissory estoppel applies where the party to be bound made a 1) <b>promise</b> with 2) intent to <b>induce reliance</b> and there 3) was <b>reasonable reliance</b> and 4) <b>failure to enforce</b> the promise would cause an injustice.</p><p>Here Homer made a promise because he \"promised\" to pay $30,000. And he did that with intent to induce reliance because Homer didnâ€™t want to â€œlive in a tentâ€. Bill reasonably relied on Homerâ€™s promise because he \"hired Fred\" in \"reasonable reliance\" on the promise. But there is NO INJUSTICE because Bill was only induced by Homer\'s lie to do exactly what he was already legally obligated to do -- finish the house. Homer reaped NO UNJUST ENRICHMENT because he only got the house that he had already been promised, and had promised to pay for.</p><p>Therefore, Bill was not induced to do anything he was not otherwise obligated to do, and Homer did not receive anything of value that he was not entitled to.</p><p>Since there was no injustice, promissory estoppel would not apply.</p><p>Further, Bill had UNCLEAN HANDS because he had a legal duty to perform under the contract, and he elicited Homerâ€™s promise to pay $30,000 more by threatening to breach the contract. A Court of equity will not act to enforce a promise elicited by a threat of illegal conduct.</p><p>Therefore, Homerâ€™s promise to pay more cannot be enforced at either law or equity.</p><p><b>Sample 6, page 93</b></p><p><b>3. What are Dottie\'s remedies for enforcement at equity?</b></p><p><b>8) PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</b></p><p>If a plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law, they may be able to obtain a remedy in equity. Here Dottie has an adequate remedy at law as to the promise of the stock, so she cannot seek enforcement at equity as to that part of Festerâ€™s promise. But since she has no adequate remedy as to the promise of the house, she can seek a remedy at equity as to that part of her claim.</p><p>Under the equitable doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL a promise or contract that cannot be enforced at law might be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to prevent unjust enrichment where 1) the party to be bound made a promise ,2) intending to induce reliance, 3) there was reasonable reliance on the promise by the party seeking equity, and 4) justice demands enforcement.</p><p>Here there was a promise because Fester \"promised\" to give Dottie the house. And Fester made the promise intending to induce reliance by Dottie because he wanted her to â€œmove\" to where he lived and \"nurse\" him. Dottie reasonably relied because she trusted him as an \"honest, God- fearing Christian.\" And there would be injustice otherwise because she nursed him for \"10 years.\"</p><p>To enforce the promise Dottie would argue that an award of money damages is insufficient to prevent unjust enrichment because the â€œhouseâ€ is unique property. A Court of equity may order title to the house conveyed to her (EQUITABLE REPLEVIN) to prevent injustice.</p><p>Therefore, Dottie may be able to enforce the promise in equity even though it could not be enforced at law.</p><p><b>Definiton 52. Can DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE be pled?</b></p><p>Under the theory of DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE an agreement that otherwise is unenforceable at law for&nbsp; deliberately false representations of fact by the respondent OR deliberately misleading behavior of the respondent may be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice. In order to plead equity a party must have CLEAN HANDS. Promissory Estoppel applies where the party to be bound made a </p><p>1) promise with&nbsp;</p><p>2) intent to induce reliance and there&nbsp;</p><p>3) was reasonable reliance and 4) failure to enforce the promise would cause an injustice.</p><p><b>Definiton 53. Is EQUITABLE RESTITUTION appropriate?</b></p><p>EQUITABLE RESTITUTION is a remedy awarded by a Court of EQUITY when the parties have no adequate legal remedy. The purpose may be to compensate for injuries suffered, prevent unjust enrichment, prevent frustration of reasonable expectations, or restore the status quo.</p><p><b>Sample 6, page 93</b></p><p><b>4. What are Dottie\'s remedies in alternative to enforcement?&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>9) EQUITABLE RESTITUTION?</b></p><p>At equity a party that cannot enforce a promise at law or equity may still seek damages in RESTITUTION to prevent UNJUST ENRICHMENT. The measure of damages may be either the benefits their performance conveyed to the breaching party, or else the detriment they have suffered in reasonable reliance.</p><p>Here Dottie can seek RESTITUTION for the benefits she conveyed to Fester. He enjoyed benefits that would have cost him $40,000 a year for ten years, so he enjoyed an unjust enrichment of $400,000.</p><p>In the alternative Dottie suffered a loss of $50,000 on her house and foregone wages of $2,500,000 over the ten year period, for a total of $2,550,000.</p><p>Dottie may seek an award of money damages in these amounts in equitable restitution.</p><p><b>Definiton 54. Is SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE appropriate?</b></p><p>SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE is an equitable remedy. It is an order of the Court directing parties to deliver possession and title to unique property.&nbsp;</p><p>Definiton 55. CONSIDERATION?</p><p>Definiton 56. MUTUAL ASSENT?</p><p><b>Sample Answer 1: Contract Formation</b></p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question is a typical FORMATION question because it goes through a series of communications between the parties. When you see messages going back and forth, it is a FORMATION question, so analyze each message.</p><p>Start with an INTRODUCTORY DEFINITION of a contract. Then chronologically analyze each communication to see if it is an OFFER. Once there is an offer, the next issue is whether the offer is ACCEPTED.</p><p>If there is offer and an acceptance a contract forms and the next issue is the TERMS of the contract.</p><p>After the contract and terms are discussed the next issue is whether there has been a BREACH. And if there is a breach, the issues are WHO BREACHED and the REMEDIES of the parties.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 2: UCC and Acceptance Varying Terms</b></p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This is a UCC question, obviously. Bob breached by delivering non-conforming goods that failed to provide a perfect fit, as promised. But he has time to cure, and gave notice he intended to cure.</p><p>If Al wants out of the deal, he can claim a lack of a writing. He can do that because he is not a merchant, and the â€œsales confirmationâ€ does not apply to him. He would be a merchant if he were a collector or hobbyist. But just buying lots of clothes doesn\'t make him a merchant any more than you are a merchant because you have bought a lot of groceries.</p><p>And Al also possibly can claim frustration of purpose.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 3: Third Parties in a UCC Setting</b></p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: The point of this question is that a contract intended to benefit a third party (Chico) can be enforced against the promisor (Harpo) by both the intended beneficiary (Chico) and the promisee (Groucho). Further, a delegation contract supported by consideration (a legally binding contract and not just a gift promise) can be enforced by the delegator (Harpo) against the delegatee (Swifty) and also by the promisee (Groucho) and intended beneficiary (Chico).<br></p><p>But if the promiseeâ€™s effort (Grouchoâ€™s effort) to bestow benefit on the beneficiary (Chico) is gratuitous, the donee beneficiary cannot enforce the original contract (Groucho-Harpo contract) against the promisee (Groucho) at law. The donee beneficiary could only plead promissory estoppel or detrimental reliance against the promisee in equity, given evidence to support such a claim.</p><p>If the contract is for a sale of goods, as is the case here, the UCC also governs the remedies of the parties at law, but the equitable remedies would generally remain the same as at common law.</p><p>You should identify each party as promisee, promisor, delegatee, donee/creditor beneficiary, etc. because that designation determines their RIGHTS and REMEDIES (just as the call of the question asks.)</p><p>Keeping the parties straight may require drawing a diagram and labeling each party with the various terms.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 4: Defenses</b></p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: The most important thing this question teaches is how to \"follow the call\" of a STRUCTURED CALL while still addressing important issues the call fails to mention.</p><p>While the CALL asks you about Tomâ€™s rights against Al, and Alâ€™s rights against Tom, and Alâ€™s rights against Deccra, and Deccraâ€™s rights against Al, you only have to state the parties twice: â€œTom v. Alâ€ and â€œAl v. Deccraâ€. It is simply a waste of time to state the parties again with their names switched around.</p><p>The call of the question asks the validity of an oral contract. That requires you to immediately determine if the UCC applies. UCC Article 2 does not apply because this question does not involve the sale of goods, but Article 1 (1-206) may apply because it involves a sale of recording rights. Even if those do not apply, the Statute of Frauds applies because this is a contract that necessarily cannot be performed in less than a year.</p><p>Remember oral contracts and contracts signed by minors may be valid but not enforceable. Or, they may be unenforceable at law but enforceable at equity. It depends on the facts. Even if a party cannot enforce the contract, they may get quantum meruit reimbursement if the other party would otherwise receive an unjust enrichment.</p><p>Deccraâ€™s defense against enforcement of the March 1 contract could be stated as the issue of â€œunilateral mistakeâ€ where Tom knew Deccra was mistaken, but since Tom deliberately lied to Deccra about Alâ€™s age with intent to deceive â€œfraudâ€ seems the more accurate issue statement.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 5: Common Law Modification, Breach and Remedy</b></p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: Don\'t let sympathy blind you. Effective modification of a common law contract (not UCC) requires an exchange of consideration. Here Bill receives a promise of $30,000, but Homer gets nothing. If Homer gets nothing, then he gets no consideration (no bargained for thing in exchange for his promise).</p><p>Restatement 2nd provides that a â€œgood faithâ€ modification requires no consideration to be enforced at law. But that is not clearly â€œbroadly adoptedâ€. The general view seems to be that consideration is required to enforce a modification agreement at law, and without consideration it may only be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice. Besides, an agreement made â€œunder threatâ€ is hardly in good faith anyway.</p><p>Consider a situation where Bill demands $30,000 more but also promises to paint the house a different color. In that case there would be a bargained for exchange of consideration, so Homer would have to argue he was forced to agree to pay more under duress, a different legal defense argument. But here that is not the case, so any argument of â€˜duressâ€™ is unnecessary and irrelevant.</p><p>For defenses, impossible means just that. If the non-breaching party can finish the job, so can the breaching party.</p><p>If the question has dollar amounts, state the dollar amounts each party should get (or pay) when discussing remedy.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 6: Common Law Remedies</b></p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This call of this question is for a discussion of REMEDIES and yet the facts raise other issues that should be discussed first such as the Statute of Frauds.</p><p>Always follow the call of the question, but you can use \"sub-issues\" as shown here to discuss necessary issues that the call does not mention.</p><p>The first question asked in the call should settle the matter of the stock since Dottie has an adequate legal remedy as to that part of her claim. The last three questions deal with the promise of just the house, and as to that Dottie has no adequate legal remedy because the Statute of Frauds generally bars legal enforcement of an oral contract for conveyance of an interest in land.</p><p>Another possible issue here is the â€œpart performance doctrineâ€ under which the Court will legally enforce an oral sales agreement for land in certain very narrow circumstances. The reason I donâ€™t discuss it in my sample answer is that it would so clearly fail that it did not seem an intended issue. That doctrine requires the â€œbuyerâ€ to take possession of the land in a manner that almost unequivocally proves an oral sales agreement. Here Dottie did not take possession; she shared possession. And nothing she did â€œunequivocallyâ€ showed any oral agreement to â€œsellâ€ the land.</p><p>Therefore, it appears Dottieâ€™s only remedies as to the promise of the house are at equity.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 7: UCC Formation, Breach and Remedy</b></p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This is a simple UCC formation, breach and remedy question. The need for writing, and the existence of a writing must be discussed.</p><p>If an offeree says it â€œwillâ€ or â€œwouldâ€ ship goods it is a promise to ship and an acceptance, even if they cite a varying term. In this case UCC 2-207 applies. But if the offeree only says it â€œcanâ€ or â€œcouldâ€ ship on different terms it is not a promise to ship. It is really a rejection and counter-offer.</p><p>The unusual fact here is that Buyco has suffered no loss, so they can recover no damages. This should be expressly recognized. They promised to buy for $6 and they covered for $5. They benefited from Sellco\'s error and have no cause of action.]</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-10-22 14:05:30', 1);

INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS?</b></p><p>Under tort law intentional infliction is an intentional, <b>outrageous act</b> causing the plaintiff <b>severe emotional distress</b>. Generally emotional distress will not be assumed, and the plaintiff must present evidence showing that they did, in fact, suffer severe emotional distress. Evidence of mere humiliation and embarrassment is generally not enough.</p><p><b>Definition 6. TRESPASS TO LAND?</b></p><p>Under tort law a trespass to land is an intentional act causing <b>unauthorized entry</b> onto, under or <b>over</b> the <b>land of another</b>. The entry may be by the defendant personally or by some person or object directed or placed on the land by the defendant. When an object is placed on the land it constitutes a â€œcontinuing trespass.â€ No damage is necessary, but the defendant is liable for all damage actually caused. And if malice can be shown the defendant may be liable for punitive damages.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Definition 7. TRESPASS TO CHATTELS?</b></p><p>Under tort law TRESPASS TO CHATTEL is an intentional act by the defendant causing <b>unauthorized interference</b> with or <b>damage</b> to the <b>chattel</b> of the plaintiff.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 8. TRANSFERRED INTENT?</b></p><p>Under tort law transferred intent means that a defendant that acts with <b>intent to commit any tort</b> injury on <b>anyone</b> will be <b>liable for every injury</b> inflicted on <b>everyone</b>, even if the person injured or the injury suffered is not what was originally intended.&nbsp;</p><p>An exception is that Courts generally will not find IIED based on transferred intent, and Courts may find only negligence and not an intentional tort by transferred intent if the original intent of the defendant was not malicious.</p><p><b>Definition 9. DAMAGES for TORTS?</b></p><p>Every defendant that commits any tort is liable for all actual damages actually and proximately caused. Damages consist of SPECIAL DAMAGES, compensation for monetary losses, and GENERAL DAMAGES, compensation for pain, suffering, anxiety, emotional distress, inconvenience, etc. Defendants who commit intentional torts, including gross negligence (deliberate breach of duty) and recklessness (deliberate creation of unreasonable risks) may also be liable for PUNITIVE DAMAGES if the Court finds they acted with FRAUD, OPPRESSION or MALICE, an evil or wrongful intent to cause harm. Defendants who commit accidentally negligent torts are not liable for punitive damages. Tort plaintiffs have a right to â€œwaive the tortâ€ and demand RESTITUTION instead of compensation for damages.</p><p><b>Definition 10. DEFENSE of DISCIPLINE?</b></p><p>Under tort law a person with recognized authority (schoolteacher, bus driver, airplane pilot, policeman, parent, etc.) is privileged to act reasonably given the circumstances in a manner that otherwise might constitute a battery or false imprisonment.</p><p><b>Definition 11. DEFENSE of AUTHORITY OF LAW (PREVENTION OF CRIME)?</b></p><p>Under tort law a person is privileged to act reasonably to prevent or stop a FELONY or DISTURBANCE OF THE PEACE from being committed in their presence.</p><p><b>Definition 12. DEFENSE of RECAPTURE?</b></p><p>Under tort law a person has a qualified privilege to use reasonable force to RECAPTURE their own chattel if 1) they have asked for and have been refused return of the chattel, and 2) they are in fresh pursuit of wrongfully taken chattel, or 3) they lost possession of the chattel through no fault of their own.</p><p><b>Definition 13. DEFENSE of NECESSITY?</b></p><p>Under tort law a person is privileged to act reasonably as NECESSARY to protect their own safety, the safety of others, and the safety of property. For defense of property to be â€œreasonableâ€ the value of the property being protected must exceed the damages caused by the efforts to protect it. Reasonable acts done to protect the property of others is a PUBLIC NECESSITY and absolutely privileged. Reasonable acts done to protect the defendantâ€™s own property are a PRIVATE NECESSITY and only a qualified privilege. The defendant remains liable for actual damages to the plaintiff.</p><p><b>Definition 14. DEFENSE of CONSENT?</b></p><p>Under tort law FULLY INFORMED CONSENT from a person with legal capacity is a defense to most intentional torts, but is not a defense to a battery that causes foreseeable great bodily injury.</p><p><b>Definition 15. DEFENSE of OTHERS?</b></p><p>Under tort law a person is privileged to act reasonably as necessary to defend others who are NOT AGGRESSORS from harm. Aggressors are people who have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others. Courts are split when a defendant unknowingly acts to defend an AGGRESSOR. Under one view the defendant STEPS INTO THE SHOES of the aggressor and has no privilege because the aggressor could not claim self-defense. In other Courts the defendant is privileged to defend the aggressor in a fracas if they act with a REASONABLE BELIEF they are acting to defend an innocent victim of aggression.</p><p><b>Definition 16. DEFENSE of PROPERTY?</b></p><p>Under tort law defendants are privileged to use reasonable force to protect their property or the property of others. The use of deadly force to protect property is never reasonable or legal.</p><p>Under the SHOPKEEPERâ€™S PRIVILEGE a defendant may use reasonable force to detain a plaintiff for a reasonable period of time to investigate a reasonable suspicion that the plaintiff has stolen goods or services from the defendant.</p><p>To protect litigation rights defendants may use reasonable force to as necessary to detain plaintiffs for a reasonable period of time to investigate events that have caused them damages.</p><p><b>Definition 17. SELF-DEFENSE?</b></p><p>Under tort law a person who is NOT AN AGGRESSOR may act reasonably if NECESSARY to protect their own safety. Modernly the person can â€œhold her groundâ€ and has is no duty to retreat in most jurisdictions. Aggressors are people who have unreasonably created or increased dangers to others.</p><p><b>Definition 18. DEFENSE of INFANCY, INSANITY or INCOMPETENCE?</b></p><p>INFANCY, INSANITY and INCOMPETENCE are not defenses for intentional torts.</p><p><b>Practice Question 1</b></p><p>Clark Kent, star reporter for the Daily Planet was approached by panhandler Bill Gates and asked for a quarter. As a prank, Kent (who was secretly Superman) lifted and very gently flew Gates hundreds of feet up to the top of the World Tribune building and left Gates there on a ledge.</p><p>Kent hovered over the World Tribune building and never touched the surface of the building. During the flight Gates was apprehensive he might fall, but Kent had a strong grip.</p><p>Gates was embarrassed and the crowd below taunted him for hours as the fire department tried to devise a means of rescue. Gates was humiliated.</p><p>As he stood on the ledge Gates accidentally knocked a decorative panel loose. It fell to the ground and injured fireman Frank.</p><p>Suddenly Gates discovered that there was an unlocked window next to him all the time. He opened the window and escaped immediately.</p><p>Discuss Kent\'s liability to Gates, the World Tribune and fireman Frank.</p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question has all of the common law intentional torts except for conversion and trespass to chattels. Why did Kent act? Because he intended to pull a â€œprank.â€ That fact expressly proves his acts were intentional. His physical acts imply intent, but the fact he wanted to pull a â€œprankâ€ expressly proves intent. That saves you time.</p><p>Be prepared for batteries that cause â€œoffenseâ€ but not harm. Being pushed around by a stranger is offensive to a reasonable person, and be prepared to state that.</p><p>The whole purpose of having fireman Frank hurt is to raise the issue of transferred intent. Did you spot the issue? Donâ€™t turn to â€œnegligenceâ€ when the acts causing harm are intentional.</p><p>If Frank was injured as the result of negligence by Kent or Gates, he might have no case because of the â€œFiremanâ€™s Ruleâ€ that rescue personnel cannot sue for injuries suffered as a result of the negligence of others that creates the emergency situation to which they have responded. That is often codified in statute, and it expressly recognizes the issue that emergency personnel, by occupation, have assumed the risks of their employment.</p><p>But the Firemanâ€™s Rule does not generally extend to injury caused by intentional torts.</p><p>Some professors insist that students â€œalways discuss defensesâ€, and if your professor insists on that humor the prof and discuss defenses, even when there are no facts to suggest any. Often this sort of professor also wants the defenses discussed at the end of the essay in a â€œDefensesâ€ section.</p><p>But generally the writers of law exam and bar exam questions will guide you by giving you facts to suggest the issues you are to discuss, and if you are not given any facts that suggest an issue it means they donâ€™t want you to discuss that issue.</p><p>And generally question writers want and expect you to discuss the issues in the order in which they arise in the fact pattern.</p><p>If no facts are presented to suggest any plausible defense the writer is effectively saying, â€œI donâ€™t want you to discuss defenses!â€ Here there are absolutely no facts to suggest that Kent has any plausible defense claims, so I didnâ€™t waste my time discussing it.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 16-1: Intentional Torts</b></p><p><b>GATES V. KENT</b></p><p><b>1) TORTIOUS ASSAULT?</b></p><p>Under tort law an assault is an intentional act to cause, and which does cause, reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery, a harmful or offensive touching. An act is intentional if it is for the purpose or with knowledge with reasonable certainty a result will occur.</p><p>Here Kent acted intentionally because he intended to pull a \"prank\" on Gates. His intent because it was a \"prank\" was to cause Gates to be \"apprehensive\". Gates was â€œapprehensiveâ€ and that was reasonable because he was held â€œhundreds of feet in the airâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Kent can be liable for assault.</p><p><b>2) TORTIOUS BATTERY on Gates?</b></p><p>Under tort law a battery is an intentional act done to cause a harmful or offensive touching.</p><p>Here Kent acted intentionally because he intended to pull a \" prank\", and he caused a touching because he â€œlifted and flewâ€ Gates into the air. This would be an offensive touching to a reasonable person because it is socially offensive to be grabbed in this manner by a stranger.</p><p>Therefore, Kent can be liable for battery.</p><p><b>3) FALSE IMPRISONMENT?</b></p><p>Under tort law a false imprisonment is an intentional act causing the plaintiff to be confined to a defined space against their will with no reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit. The plaintiff must be aware of the confinement.</p><p>Here Kent intentionally acted because it was a â€œprankâ€, and he confined Gates with no reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit because he put him on a â€œledgeâ€. And Gates was aware of his confinement because he was \"apprehensive\" of falling and \"taunted\" by the crowd.</p><p>Kent may argue that Gates was not actually confined because all he had to do was go through the â€œwindowâ€. But that means of exit was not reasonably apparent because even the â€œfiremenâ€ who tried to get Gates down for â€œhoursâ€ did not realize discover it.</p><p>Therefore, Kent can be liable for false imprisonment.</p><p><b>4) INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS?&nbsp; </b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Under tort law intentional infliction is an intentional, outrageous act causing the plaintiff severe emotional distress. Generally emotional distress will not be assumed, and the plaintiff must present evidence showing that they did, in fact, suffer severe emotional distress. Evidence of mere humiliation and embarrassment is generally not enough.</p><p>Here there was an intentional, outrageous act because Kent \"flew\" Gates to the top of a building and strand him there in front of a crowd where he was â€œtaunted for hoursâ€.</p><p>However there is no evidence Gates suffered severe emotional distress because the facts only state that he was \"humiliated\" and â€œembarrassedâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Kent can only be liable for IIED if Gates presents additional evidence of emotional distress.</p><p><b>WORLD TRIBUNE V. KENT</b></p><p><b> 5) TRESPASS TO LAND?</b></p><p>Under tort law a trespass to land is an intentional act causing unauthorized entry onto, under or over the land of another. The entry may be by the defendant personally or by some person or object directed or placed on the land by the defendant. When an object is placed on the land it constitutes a â€œcontinuing trespass.â€ No damage is necessary, but the defendant is liable for all damage actually caused. And if malice can be shown the defendant may be liable for punitive damages.</p><p>Here Kent was over the land of the World Tribune because he \"hovered\" over the \"building.\" And he caused Gates to go onto the land because he put Gates on the \"ledge.\" This caused actual damage because Gates accidentally caused a \"panel to fall.\" Additional damages are implied by the fact â€œfiremenâ€ worked in the building â€œfor hoursâ€ trying to rescue Gates. This disruption probably caused Tribune to suffer lost wages and lost profits.</p><p>Further, the possibility of malice is implied by the fact that Kent worked for one newspaper, the Daily Planet, and he disrupted business activities at what appears to be a competing newspaper, the World Tribune.</p><p>Therefore Kent would be liable for all damages he actually caused Tribune based on trespass to land, and may also be liable for punitive damages if implied malice could be proven.</p><p><b>FIREMAN FRANK V. KENT</b></p><p><b>6) BATTERY by TRANSFERRED INTENT?</b></p><p>Battery is defined above. Under tort law transferred intent means that a defendant that acts with intent to commit any tort injury on anyone will be liable for every injury inflicted on everyone, even if the person injured or the injury suffered is not what was originally intended. Some Courts limit the application of transferred intent, but it is more likely to be applied when the original tortious act was intended to inflict harm.</p><p>Here Kent intentionally acted to cause Gates to suffer assault, battery, false imprisonment and possibly intentional infliction of emotional distress, and he intended to cause a trespass to the land of the World Tribune. In turn, that caused Frank to suffer a â€œharmful touchingâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Kent would be liable to Frank for battery by transferred intent.</p><p><b>Definition 19. NEGLIGENCE?</b></p><p>Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is the failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances. To establish a prima facie case Plaintiff must generally prove DUTY, BREACH, ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSATION and DAMAGES.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 20. STRICT LIABILITY in NEGLIGENCE?</b></p><p>Under tort law a defendant that engages in any of three activities is STRICTLY LIABLE to any person who is actually and proximately caused injury. These three activities are: 1) keeping a KNOWN, DANGEROUS ANIMAL, 2) keeping an EXOTIC ANIMAL of a type that is not commonly domesticated, or 3) engaging in ULTRA-HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES that are unusual, pose extreme risks to others, and are usually subject to strict safety regulations.</p><p><b>Definition 21. DUTY?</b></p><p>Under tort law the general rule is that a person has no duty to act to defend others from harm. A DUTY to act to protect others from harm ONLY arises under five scenarios: [SCRAP] STATUTE, CONTRACT, RELATIONSHIP, ASSUMPTION or where PERIL to the plaintiff is caused by the defendant.</p><p><b>Definition 22. NEGLIGENCE PER SE?</b></p><p>If a STATUTE creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute NEGLIGENCE PER SE if the purpose of the statute was to protect the CLASS OF PEOPLE to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 23. DUTY BASED ON PERIL?</b></p><p>Under tort law defendants that create reasonably foreseeable dangers to others have a DUTY based on PERIL to act reasonably to protect others from those dangers.&nbsp;</p><p>Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the zone of danger caused by the defendant\'s acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendantâ€™s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrews held that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 24. DUTY BASED ON PREMISES LIABILITY?</b></p><p>Under tort law OCCUPIERS OF LAND have a duty to both those who come onto the land and to those off the land. This is a form of duty based on RELATIONSHIP.</p><p>Under the common law occupiers of land had no duty to UNKNOWN TRESPASSERS.</p><p>The occupiers had a duty to warn and protect KNOWN TRESPASSERS and LICENSEES from known, hidden dangers and artificial conditions. Licensees are people allowed onto the land but not for the occupiersâ€™ benefit.</p><p>The occupiers had a duty to reasonably inspect the land and warn and protect INVITEES from known, hidden dangers and artificial conditions. Invitees are people invited or allowed onto the land for the occupiersâ€™ benefit.</p><p>Finally the occupiers of land had a duty to conduct and control activities on the land with due care to prevent injury to PEOPLE OFF THE LAND.</p><p>Modernly these rigid rules by classification have often been modified by both statute and Court decision to create a balancing test under which occupiers of land have a duty of due care to ALL PEOPLE to act as reasonable people would in inspecting, maintaining and using their property so that it does not pose known dangers to others.</p><p><b>Definition 25. ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE DOCTRINE?</b></p><p>Under the ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE DOCTRINE an OCCUPIER OF LAND who <b>knows that children have or may in the future</b> trespassed onto her land has a strict duty to<b> inspect for and eliminate any condition posing dangers </b>the children might not fully appreciate because of their young age.</p><p>This is a duty based on RELATIONSHIP which poses almost strict liability. The only defense the landowner may raise is assumption of the risk.</p><p><b>Definition 26. LIABILITY BASED ON RESCUER DOCTRINE / FIREMANâ€™S RULE?</b></p><p>Under the RESCUER DOCTRINE defendants may be liable to rescuers who are injured attempting to rescue people injured.</p><p>But under the FIREMANâ€™S RULE defendants are generally not liable to professional rescue workers because they have ASSUMED THE RISKS associated with their professions.</p><p><b>Definition 27. BREACH of duty?</b></p><p>Under tort law a BREACH is the failure to exercise DUE CARE. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstance.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 28. BREACH based on RES IPSA LOQUITUR?</b></p><p>Under the doctrine of RES IPSA LOQUITUR an INFERENCE OF BREACH exists if 1) negligence by someone is implied by the facts, 2) the defendant had control of the event or instrument that caused injury, and 3) the plaintiff had no control over the event or instrument causing injury.</p><p><b>Definition 29. BREACH BASED ON NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT?</b></p><p>Under tort law defendants who NEGLIGENTLY ENTRUST third parties with resources or authority are directly liable for injuries actually and proximately caused as a result.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 30. RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR?</b></p><p>Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR an employer, master or principal is vicariously liable for all torts committed by an employee, servant or agent, respectively, if the tort is committed within the scope of the employment or agency relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Respondeat superior does not apply to independent contractors.</p><p><b>Definition 31. VICARIOUS LIABILITY for JOINT ENTERPRISE?</b><br></p><p>Under tort law each member of a JOINT ENTERPRISE is vicariously liable for all torts committed by other members within the scope of the enterprise relationship. A joint enterprise is one in which two or more parties agree to work together for mutual benefit and each shares equal rights of control over assets and activities.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 32. LIABILITY for acts of an INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR?</b><br></p><p>Under tort law people who hire INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS to perform duties that are not â€œnon-delegableâ€ by law are NOT vicariously liable for torts committed by the contractors and can only be directly liable because of negligent selection or negligent entrustment of the contractors. An independent contractor is a person selected to provide labor services without close and regular supervision [e.g. gardeners, housekeepers, house painters and babysitters that are not employed on an exclusive and continuous basis.]</p><p><b>Definition 33. The ACTUAL CAUSE or a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR causing injury?</b><br></p><p>Under tort law the defendant is the ACTUAL CAUSE of injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured BUT FOR the acts of the defendant.</p><p>If two or more defendants acted negligently, the plaintiff would not have been injured if neither had acted, and the plaintiff cannot reasonably prove she would not have been injured but for the acts of each alone, then each defendant is a SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR causing injury.</p><p><b>Definition 34. PROXIMATE CAUSE?</b></p><p>Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was so DIRECT, NATURAL and FORESEEABLE, so close in time and place, resulting from a CHAIN OF CAUSATION begun by the defendantâ€™s acts, unbroken by UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS that the law will impose liability for the result.</p><p>Generally if two or more events are actual causes of the plaintiffâ€™s injury, the last event will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT cutting off the liability of all defendants who acted earlier. However, it is a matter of settled law that negligent acts by others are FORESEEABLE so they can never be intervening events. Acts of nature [e.g. tornados] and criminal or intentionally tortious acts by third parties [e.g. thefts, batteries] are presumed to be UNFORESEEABLE and will terminate defendantsâ€™ liability unless extrinsic evidence shows defendants were aware the subsequent events were likely to occur.</p><p><b>Definition 35. EGG SHELL PLAINTIFF?</b></p><p>Under the EGG-SHELL PLAINTIFF concept, defendants are liable for all damages they actually cause plaintiffs, even if the plaintiffs , through no fault of their own, have pre-existing conditions that make them especially vulnerable to injury. The doctrine of the law is that â€œdefendants must take plaintiffs as they find them.â€&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 35b. Damages in Negligence are:</b></p><p>Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and suffering).&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 36. CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?</b></p><p>Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was responsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY approach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiffâ€™s recovery based on the degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own injuries is completely barred from recovery.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 37. ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?</b><br></p><p>Under tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete defense when plaintiffs 1) put themselves at risk, 2) with a full awareness of the risks, and 3) a conscious acceptance of the risks.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 38. NEGLIGENT INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS (NIED)?</b></p><p>Under tort law, a BYSTANDER to an event may bring an action for NEGLIGENT INFLICTION if they suffer severe emotional distress and there is a nexus between the negligent act and the injury based on a PROXIMITY IN TIME, PLACE and RELATIONSHIP. In some jurisdictions a physical manifestation of emotional distress must be shown.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not discuss NIED unless the plaintiff is a BYSTANDER who only witnesses or hears about some accident that injures another person. If the plaintiff is actually, physically involved in an event they have an action for NEGLIGENCE and can recover for their â€œemotional distressâ€ as special damages.</p><p><b>Practice Question 2</b></p><p>Tom bought some firecrackers in Rural County, where they were legal. He took them into the National Forest where federal law prohibited the possession and use of fireworks. The federal law was enacted to reduce the threat of forest fires and injury on national lands.</p><p>In the National Forest Tom waded to a gravel bar in the middle of Big River, and there he carefully lit and threw the firecrackers into the air above the river. Occasionally one would fail to explode and it would fall harmlessly into the water. There was no one else around, and there was nothing on the gravel bar that could burn.</p><p>Little Dick was playing a half-mile upstream from Tom, throwing sticks into Big River. He was three years old. His mother warned him to stay back from the edge of the river because it was dangerous. Dick disobeyed his mother and recklessly pushed a rotted tree into the river and it swirled away in the water. No one was hurt.</p><p>Half a mile downstream from Tom, Paula was one of five people on the bridge above Big River fishing for trout. Paula was outside the National Forest boundaries. She had ignored a sign that said \"No Fishing From Bridge.\" Fishing from the bridge was prohibited for traffic safety, but she was well off the roadway and there were very few cars this time of year. Paula was sitting carelessly on the edge of the bridge, but it was a nice day, the water was only six feet below her, and she knew how to swim.</p><p>Tom threw another firecracker into the air and it did not explode. Instead it fell onto the log that Dick had pushed into the river upstream.</p><p>The log swept down the river for half a mile before the firecracker exploded just as the log swept under the bridge.</p><p>Paula was startled and fell into the river.</p><p>Other people that had been fishing rushed off the bridge and down the river bank to rescue Paula as she laughingly climbed up the bank.</p><p>Harry had been fishing too, but instead of going to help Paula, he stayed on the bridge and took two dollars out of Paula\'s purse. No one saw Harry take the money and the crime was never solved. Paula was hurt and upset.</p><p>Under what theories can Paula seek to recover from Tom and Dick and what defenses would they raise?</p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question focuses on the outer limits of DUTY to a remotely situated plaintiff (with firecracker yet, a la Palsgraf) and PROXIMATE CAUSATION of damage by some burning object floating down a river (a la Wagon Mound I and II). The question also focuses on the outer limits of BREACH because one cannot be breaching a duty by an act that poses no foreseeable risk to others.</p><p>Law schools tend to brainwash every student into thinking they can always sue, and win, for every injury. The truth is that Paulaâ€™s case is frivolous. ]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 16-2: Negligence</b></p><p><b>PAULA V. TOM</b></p><p><b>NEGLIGENCE?</b></p><p>Paulaâ€™s only cause of action here is for NEGLIGENCE. Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is the failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances. To establish a prima facie case Paula must generally prove DUTY, BREACH, ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSATION and DAMAGES.</p><p><b>1) DUTY?</b></p><p>Generally a person owes no duty to others. But a duty may be based on a STATUTE, a CONTRACT, a RELATIONSHIP, the ASSUMPTION of a duty, or PERIL caused by the defendant.</p><p><b>NEGLIGENCE PER SE?</b></p><p>If a STATUTE creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute NEGLIGENCE PER SE if the purpose of the statute was to protect the CLASS OF PEOPLE to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent.</p><p>Here Tom violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused Paula to suffer injury. But she was not in the CLASS OF PEOPLE the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people â€œon national landsâ€ and she was â€œoutside the National Forest boundariesâ€. Further, she did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent because it was to â€œprevent forest fires and injuryâ€ while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.</p><p>Therefore, Paula would be unable to prove Tom was negligent per se.</p><p><b>DUTY BASED ON PERIL?</b></p><p>Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the zone of danger caused by the defendant\'s acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendantâ€™s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.</p><p>Andrews held that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.</p><p>Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because â€œno one else was aroundâ€ and there was â€œnothing that could burnâ€.</p><p>Paula appeared to be outside the zone of danger caused by Tom\'s activities because she was a \"half mile downstream.\" Paula might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the â€œgravel barâ€ because Tom should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to prove that Tom had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.</p><p><b>2) BREACH?</b></p><p>Under tort law a BREACH is the failure to exercise DUE CARE. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstance.</p><p>Here Tom went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone because he went to a \"gravel bar\" in the \"middle of the river\" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers â€œcarefullyâ€.</p><p>Paula could only argue that a reasonably observant person would have seen the â€œlogâ€ floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.</p><p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than Tom.</p><p><b>3) ACTUAL CAUSE of injury to Paula?</b></p><p>Under tort law an act ACTUALLY CAUSES injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured but for the act.</p><p>Here Paula would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if Tom had not thrown the firecracker.</p><p>Therefore, Tom was the actual cause of Paula\'s injury.</p><p><b>4) PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury to Paula?</b></p><p>Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable, close in time and place to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events.</p><p>Generally when there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the last, unforeseeable, intentional act will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting off all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent additional specific facts.</p><p>Here Paula was rather far away from Tom in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further a reasonable person could not foresee that a firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if Tom was the proximate cause of Paula falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harryâ€™s criminal act was an unforeseeable intervening event.</p><p>Therefore, Paula probably could not prove Tom was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.</p><p><b>5) DAMAGES?</b></p><p>Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and suffering).</p><p>Here Paula had SPECIAL damages because she lost \"two dollars\" and she had GENERAL damages because she was \"hurt and upset.\" But she got out of the river â€œlaughinglyâ€ and was not â€œhurt and upsetâ€ until after she discovered the purse was stolen.</p><p>Therefore Paula suffered actual damages, but Tom was not the cause of those damages. </p><p><b>6) CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?</b></p><p>Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was responsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY approach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiffâ€™s recovery based on the degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own injuries is completely barred from recovery.</p><p>NEGLIGENCE PER SE is defined above. Tom might argue Paula was NEGLIGENT PER SE because she was fishing on the bridge where that is prohibited by statute. But Paula did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was to prevent. The purpose of the statute was â€œtraffic safetyâ€ and she was not injured in a traffic accident.</p><p>Therefore any â€œnegligence per seâ€ argument by Tom would fail.</p><p>Tomâ€™s better argument is that Paula was contributorily (comparatively) negligent because she sat â€œcarelesslyâ€ and that placed her in PERIL of falling.</p><p>Therefore, Tom could easily prove Paula was â€œcarelessâ€ and partly responsible for her own injury.</p><p><b>7) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?</b></p><p>Under tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete defense when plaintiffs 1) put themselves at risk, 2) with a full awareness of the risks, and 3) a conscious acceptance of the risks.</p><p>Here Paula put herself at risk because she â€œsat carelesslyâ€. She had a full awareness of the risks that she could fall. And she appears to have consciously accepted those risks because the river was only a few â€œfeetâ€ below her, â€œshe could swimâ€ and it was a â€œnice dayâ€.</p><p>Therefore Tom may be able to prove assumption of the risks.</p><p>Negligence is defined above.</p><p><b>8) DUTY?</b></p><p>Duty was defined above. Here Dick could only have a duty based on PERIL, and there is little evidence Dickâ€™s act created reasonably foreseeable peril to anyone. The only foreseeable danger he caused by pushing the log in the river is that it might hit someone swimming in the river downstream. Therefore the â€œzone of dangerâ€ created by his act is the surface of the river downstream. There is no evidence anyone was in the river, and Paula was certainly not because she was on the bridge..</p><p>Therefore, there is no evidence Dick created any foreseeable peril to anyone, and if that could not be proven he did not owe Paula or anyone else a duty.</p><p><b>9) BREACH AND STANDARD OF CARE?</b></p><p>Breach was defined above. The STANDARD OF CARE for a child is to act in the manner reasonable children of the same age and experience act.</p><p>Here Dick was only â€œthree years oldâ€ and he would only be negligent if he acted in a manner that children of that age do not reasonably act.</p><p>Since Dick was so young it is unlikely Paula could prove that he breached his duty, if he had a duty.</p><p><b>10) PROXIMATE CAUSE? </b></p><p>Proximate cause is defined above.</p><p>Here Dick was even farther away from Paula than Tom, and it was even more unforeseeable that his act could harm her or anyone else.</p><p>Therefore, Paula would have even a more difficult time proving Dick was the cause of her injury.</p><p><b>Definition 39. PRODUCTS LIABILITY?</b></p><p>Under PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW a person who places an unreasonably dangerous product into the steam of commerce may be liable for the injury it causes. There are four basic theories on which a product liability action may be brought: Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, Negligence and Strict Liability.&nbsp;</p><p>A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses serious and likely dangers, that 2) could be reduced or eliminated easily, 3) without damaging product utility, or else 4) the product utility does not justify the dangers posed.&nbsp;</p><p>Under tort law there is a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY if a product is sold with 1) express representations that the buyer 2) relies on and 3) the representations are incorrect and 4) it causes the purchaser injury. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.&nbsp;</p><p>Under tort law there is a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY if a product is unsafe for ordinary use or for the buyerâ€™s known intended use, the buyer relies on the expertise of the seller, and the buyer is injured as a result. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.&nbsp;</p><p>Under a NEGLIGENCE theory the defendant has a <b>duty not to place unreasonably dangerous goods</b> into the stream of commerce. The plaintiff must be a <b>foreseeable plaintiff</b> proximately caused <b>injury</b> by the <b>negligent acts of the defendant</b>.</p><p>Negligence is a failure to use the care a reasonable person would in the same circumstance. To prevail the plaintiff must prove duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause and damages.&nbsp;</p><p>DUTY? Under tort law a person has a duty to not put an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce. Further, a person who makes express representations about a product assumes a duty of due care to make sure they are accurate and will not create peril.&nbsp;</p><p>Here Sam owed Tom a DUTY because he was the seller of a product that posed foreseeable harm.&nbsp;</p><p>BREACH? Sam BREACHED his duty because he \"never read the owner\'s manual\" and misrepresented the saw.&nbsp;</p><p>CAUSATION? That was the ACTUAL CAUSE of his injury because he would not have been hurt if he did not buy the saw. This was also the PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury because it was the direct and foreseeable result.&nbsp;</p><p>DAMAGES? Tom had INJURY because he was \"burned.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, Tom could recover on a negligence theory.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Strict Liability Theory</b></p><p>And, under a STRICT LIABILITY theory the plaintiff must show the seller was a COMMERCIAL SUPPLIER, the product was unreasonably dangerous at the time it left the defendant\'s control, and the defendant is only liable for non-economic damages.</p><p>Under tort law a commercial seller of a product is strictly liable for personal injury or property damage if the product is unreasonably dangerous at the time it leaves the seller. The seller is liable to any person who is injured as a result.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Practice Question 3</b></p><p>The Macho-X99 chainsaw is a light-duty chainsaw designed for trees no bigger than 18\". In the owner\'s manual said in big red letters, \"WARNING -- NEVER TRY TO CUT DOWN A TREE BIGGER THAN 18\" OR THIS SAW MIGHT CATCH FIRE.\" There were no warnings on the saw itself.</p><p>Tom went into Sam\'s Bargain Center. Sam told him, \"This is the best chainsaw on the market. The Macho-X99 will cut trees up to 36\" in diameter.\" Tom bought the Macho-X99 chainsaw.</p><p>Dick went into Sam\'s Bargain Center and said he didn\'t know much about chainsaws but needed one that could cut a tree about 24\" in diameter. Sam told him, \"I am an expert when it comes to chainsaws.

When Tom and Dick tried to cut down trees bigger than 18\" the saws burst into flames and burned them.</p><p>Moe saw the warning in the owner\'s manual and tried to return the saw. Sam refused to give Moe his money back. Moe was disgusted and threw the saw in the garbage â€œDumpsterâ€.</p><p>Harry saw Moe\'s old saw in the garbage and took it. There was no owner\'s manual, but the saw was just like brand new. When he first used the saw it burst into flames and burned him.</p><p>Discuss all the theories under which Tom, Dick and Harry would seek to recover from Sam. Under which theories can they NOT recover?</p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question calls for a discussion of the four theories of product liability. The facts are intended to illustrate the differences between express and implied breach along with the fact that strict product liability theory extends to remote plaintiffs.</p><p>The preliminary discussion of whether this is an â€œunreasonably dangerous productâ€ or not is very, very important. Stating the â€œbalanceâ€ test given here is MANDATORY if you want to score maximum points.</p><p>Be wary of products that are not really â€œunreasonably dangerousâ€ at all because they have been extensively tested, have great utility (often saves lives), pose trivial risks (turns hair green) to a very small number of users (less than 0.05%), and what little danger they pose is totally unknown to the manufacturer or simply cannot be easily eliminated. That is NOT an unreasonably dangerous product!</p><p>As for Harry, it is not clear if a person can prevail on a products liability claim if the product has been discarded, scrapped or abandoned. The purpose of product liability law is to protect consumers and regular users of products, not â€œDumpster Diversâ€. There is a strong argument that a product is no longer in the â€œstream of commerceâ€ after it has been discarded or scrapped.</p><p>Here it seems that Harry put the product back in the stream of commerce by retrieving it from the Dumpster. Also he has assumed the risk by doing that since he knew or should have known something might be wrong with a product that has been discarded.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 3: Product Liability</b></p><p><b>TOM V. SAM</b></p><p>Under PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW a person who places an unreasonably dangerous product into the steam of commerce may be liable for the injury it causes. There are four basic theories on which a product liability action may be brought: Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, Negligence and Strict Liability.</p><p><b>1) UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS?</b></p><p>A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses serious and likely dangers, that 2) could be reduced or eliminated easily, 3) without damaging product utility, or else 4) the product utility does not justify the dangers posed.</p><p>Here the product presented serious and likely dangers because it could burst into flame under normal use, and those dangers could have been eliminated or reduced easily by putting a warning on the saw.</p><p>Therefore this was an unreasonably dangerous product at the time of sale. </p><p><b>2) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</b></p><p>Under tort law there is a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY if a product is sold with 1) express representations that the buyer 2) relies on and 3) the representations are incorrect and 4) it causes the purchaser injury. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.</p><p>Here Sam made express representations to Tom because he said the saw \"would cut 36\" trees\" and Tom relied because he \"bought\" the saw. This was incorrect because the saw would only cut \"18\" trees\", and this caused injury because Tom was \"burned\" when the saw caught on fire. And Tom had privity of contract because he was a \"purchaser.\"</p><p>Therefore, Tom can recover under a breach of warranty theory.</p><p><b>3) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?</b></p><p>Under tort law there is a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY if a product is unsafe for ordinary use or for the buyerâ€™s known intended use, the buyer relies on the expertise of the seller, and the buyer is injured as a result. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.</p><p>Here Tom would argue he bought the saw for ordinary use, relied on Samâ€™s expertise, and was injured as a result. Sam might argue that he did not know what Tomâ€™s intended use was, and there was no evidence Tom relied on his expertise.</p><p>Therefore Tom can pursue recovery on a breach of implied warranty theory.</p><p><b>4) NEGLIGENCE?</b></p><p>Negligence is a failure to use the care a reasonable person would in the same circumstance. To prevail the plaintiff must prove duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause and damages.</p><p><b>DUTY?</b> Under tort law a person has a duty to not put an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce. Further, a person who makes express representations about a product assumes a duty of due care to make sure they are accurate and will not create peril.</p><p>Here Sam owed Tom a DUTY because he was the seller of a product that posed foreseeable harm.</p><p><b>BREACH?</b> Sam BREACHED his duty because he \"never read the owner\'s manual\" and misrepresented the saw.</p><p><b>CAUSATION? </b>That was the ACTUAL CAUSE of his injury because he would not have been hurt if he did not buy the saw. This was also the PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury because it was the direct and foreseeable result.</p><p><b>DAMAGES?</b> Tom had INJURY because he was \"burned.\" Therefore, Tom could recover on a negligence theory.</p><p><b>5) STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?</b></p><p>Under tort law a commercial seller of a product is strictly liable for personal injury or property damage if the product is unreasonably dangerous at the time it leaves the seller. The seller is liable to any person who is injured as a result.</p><p>Here Sam was a <b>commercial seller</b> because he had a store, the \"Bargain Center\", selling the product. And the product was <b>unreasonably dangerous </b>because it \"burst into flames\" in normal use and had \"no warnings on the saw.\" This caused Tom injury because he was \"burned.\"</p><p>Therefore, Tom can recover under strict product liability.</p><p><b>DICK V. SAM</b></p><p><b>6) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?</b></p><p>Breach of express warranty is defined above.</p><p>Here Dick cannot recover under breach of express warranty because Sam only said he was an \"expert\" and \"recommended\" the saw. These are not express misrepresentations.</p><p><b>7) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY? </b></p><p>Breach of implied warranty is defined above.</p><p>Here Dick relied on Samâ€™s expertise because Dick said he â€œdidnâ€™t knowâ€ about saws and Sam said he was an â€œexpertâ€. And Sam knew Dickâ€™s intended use of the saw because he said he wanted to cut \"24\" trees\". Further, the saw was not safe because it could only cut 18\" logs, and this caused injury because the saw \"caught fire\" and Dick was \"burned\".</p><p>Therefore, Dick can recover under breach of implied warranty.</p><p><b>8) NEGLIGENCE or STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?</b></p><p>Dick\'s rights under negligence or strict product liability are the same as Tom\'s.</p><p><b>HARRY V. SAM</b></p><p><b>9) BREACH OF EXPRESS or IMPLIED WARRANTY? </b></p><p>Breach of warranty is explained above.</p><p>Here Harry did not buy the saw from Sam so there is no privity of contract between them and Harry was not a foreseeable plaintiff to Sam.

DEFAMATION?</b></p><p>Under tort law DEFAMATION is a FALSE statement of material fact PUBLISHED to others about the plaintiff CAUSING DAMAGE to REPUTATION. Defamation may be SLANDER, an oral statement, or LIBEL, a written statement.</p><p>It is usually a mistake to discuss both defamation and false light concerning the same statement because if it is a statement that would damage oneâ€™s reputation the issue is clearly defamation, not false light. If the statement does not damage the plaintiffâ€™s reputation but only causes embarrassment otherwise, it is not defamation and can only be false light.</p><p>But many false statements are PRIVILEGED where the defendant speaks to defend a <b>private interest</b>, <b>group interest </b>or the <b>public interest</b> and does so without malice and in a reasonable manner calculated to defend that interest <b>without unnecessarily harming the plaintiff</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Injury to reputation will be presumed where there is LIBEL or SLANDER PER SE. SLANDER PER SE is found where the false statement alleges CRIMINAL behavior, LOATHSOME disease, UNCHASTE behavior or improper BUSINESS practices.&nbsp;</p><p>Under NEW YORK TIMES and its progeny, a PUBLIC FIGURE PLAINTIFF must prove ACTUAL MALICE, that the false statement was made with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falseness, in order to recover in a defamation action. A PUBLIC FIGURE is a person who has acted to put themselves in the public spotlight. Further, where a matter of PUBLIC CONCERN is at issue, or where the plaintiff seeks punitive damages, the plaintiff must at least prove NEGLIGENCE.</p><p><b>More Explanation about per se and per quod:</b></p><p>Certain types of defamatory statements were damaging to reputation. Those are called defamation per se. If a statement is defamation per se, the Court may award a money judgment to plaintiffs without requiring any further evidence they suffered injury.</p><p>Other defamatory statements that were are not so clearly damaging to reputation were called defamation per quod. If a statement was defamation per quod, the Court could not award a money judgment to the plaintiffs unless they presented convincing evidence they suffered monetary losses as a result of the statements.</p><p>Whether statements are defamation per se or defamation pre quod depends on three factors:</p><p>1. Whether statements are insinuations that have to be interpreted by the listener or clearly defamatory statements about the plaintiff;</p><p>2. Whether the statements are written or oral; and</p><p>3. The subject matter of the statements.</p><p><b>Insinuations</b></p><p>Under the common law insinuations that might harm the reputation of the plaintiff were always defamation per quod whether they are oral or written, and no matter what the subject matter might be.</p><p>Three types of â€œinsinuationsâ€ were recognized by the common law: innuendo, colloquium, and inducement.&nbsp;</p><p>The important point is that if defendants do not clearly identify the plaintiffs as the subject of their statements, or the statements <b>do not clearly make factual assertions</b> about the plaintiffs that would damage their reputations, they are â€œinsinuationsâ€ and defamations per quod in all cases.</p><p>If defendants make statements that <b>clearly identify</b> the plaintiff and allege facts that would injure the plaintiffâ€™s reputation, they are clearly defamatory. But whether they were defamation per se or defamation per quod depended on whether the statements are libel or slander.</p><p><b>A. Libel:</b></p><p>A defamatory statement is libel if it is written or recorded in a manner that gives its damaging effects longevity. Under the common law a written defamatory statement about the plaintiff was libel and libel was always defamation per se, regardless of the subject matter.</p><p><b>B. Slander</b></p><p>A defamatory statement is slander if it is oral or transitory in nature so that the damaging effect soon dissipates. Under common law an oral defamatory statement about the plaintiff was slander but it was only defamation per se if it accused the plaintiff of one of the following four things:</p><p>â€¢ Having committed a serious crime;&nbsp;</p><p>â€¢ Having a loathsome disease;&nbsp;</p><p>â€¢ Engaging in sexual misconduct. (Unchaste Behavior) OR&nbsp;</p><p>â€¢ Engaging in business or professional misconduct;&nbsp;</p><p>Remember: <b>CLUB</b></p><p>Any slander regarding any other subject matter was always defamation per quod.</p><p>If plaintiffs prove the elements of defamation per se the Court can award money judgments without any proof the plaintiffs suffered monetary losses. These are general damages. If the plaintiff also proves the statements caused monetary losses those are special damages and they can be awarded in addition. This is often phrased, â€œThe plaintiff can get generals without proving specials.â€</p><p>If plaintiffs only prove the elements of defamation per quod the Court cannot award any damages at all until unless the plaintiffs prove the defamations caused monetary losses. Those are special damages. If plaintiffs do prove special damages, the Court can award general damages in addition to the special damages. But if plaintiffs fail to prove defamations per quod caused monetary losses the plaintiffs get nothing. This is often phrased, â€œThe plaintiff must prove specials to get generalsâ€.</p><p><b>Sample Essay on Defamation</b></p><p><b>Practice Question 4</b></p><p>Barbara, the famous TV news lady, was assigned to do a story on former governor, Pat Wilson, to find out why Wilson had become almost a recluse in the years since he left office.</p><p>Barbara interviewed Wilson at his home. Wilson\'s speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and he was unsteady. Barbara asked him about his health, and he declined to comment. Barbara knew Wilson had once been an alcoholic, and she suspected he had begun drinking heavily again. But she did not ask him about this because she knew he would deny it.</p><p>On TV Barbara accurately described Wilson\'s slurred speech, bloodshot eyes and unsteady gait. Then she stated, \"It appears that someone we once knew and respected has gone back to his old ways.\" She did not state who the \"someone\" was, and she did not explain what she meant by \"his old ways.\"</p><p>Because of the news broadcast, rumors rapidly spread that Wilson had again developed a drinking habit. Wilson\'s approval in polls fell dramatically, and he was passed over for the post of State Republican Chair, but he had little chance of being selected for that post.</p><p>Wilson demanded a retraction and apology, but Barbara refuses. Discuss potential action by Wilson.</p><p>[<b>ANSWER EXPLANATION</b>: This question requires discussion of defamation actions by public figures. It is an example of defamation using innuendo, interpretation (COLLOQUIUM) or knowledge of extrinsic facts (INDUCEMENT).</p><p>A definition and discussion of actual malice is necessary. Actual malice may be based on recklessness. When it comes to recklessness, this question is a wobbler because Barbara clearly could have asked and then reported \"Wilson denies a drinking problem.\"</p><p>If Wilson was not a public figure, he would only have to prove the falsity of Barbaraâ€™s statements and that they were of the sort that would damage his reputation. Barbara might then claim she was PRIVILEGED to make the statements, even if they were false. But she would have to prove she acted in a â€˜reasonable mannerâ€™ without malice to protect the public interest. But she would not be able to prove that because it is not clear what â€œpublic interestâ€ she is protecting, and it would not be reasonable to make damning statements of this type on TV about a private individual without at least questioning the person about it first directly.</p><p>PRIVILEGE is frequently tested and poorly taught so be sure to consider it in any defamation question. Did the defendant have a legitimate reason to speak out, and did they do it in a reasonable manner? The 1st Amendment does not protect defamatory statements, but it does protect the right to speak out to protect legitimate interests, as long as the defendant acts reasonably and without malice. Privilege defines the balance between these two conflicting rules of law.]</p><p><b>Practice Answer 4</b></p><p><b>WILSON v. BARBARA </b></p><p><b>1) DEFAMATION?</b></p><p>Under the law of torts DEFAMATION is a false statement of material fact of or about the plaintiff published to another party causing damage to the plaintiff\'s reputation. If the statement involves innuendo, interpretation, or knowledge of extrinsic facts it is DEFAMATION PER QUOD. Oral defamation is SLANDER and written or recorded defamation is LIBEL.</p><p>A false statement may be PRIVILEGED if the defendant speaks to defend a private interest, group interest or the public interest and does so without malice and in a reasonable manner calculated to defend that interest without unnecessarily harming the plaintiff.</p><p>Therefore, if Wilson can establish a prima facie case, and that Barbara was not privileged, Barbara can be liable for defamation.</p><p><b>2) Were there FALSE STATEMENTS OF FACT?</b></p><p>To establish a prima facie case, Wilson must show Barbara\'s objectionable comments were false. Her comments about his physical appearance, the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, would be true and not defamatory because they do not, by themselves, cause loss of reputation.</p><p>Wilson\'s denial that he had been drinking might not be credible enough to prove the point. He may have difficulty proving factually that he had not been drinking.</p><p>Therefore, Wilson may not be able to prove the remarks were false.</p><p><b>3) Were the STATEMENTS ABOUT THE PLAINTIFF?</b></p><p>Here Barbara might say her remarks were not clearly about Wilson because she only said \"someone\" had done something. But the context within which the remarks were made, comments on an interview with Wilson and his physical appearance, made it clear Barbara\'s statements were about Wilson.</p><p>The statement involved innuendo and required extrinsic facts and interpretation because it referred to \"his old ways.\" Therefore Barbara would argue this was a defamation PER QUOD, if at all. But Wilson would argue that since the remarks were made along with observations about \"slurred speech\" and \"bloodshot eyes\" viewers would interpret this as a reference to prior drinking problems even if they had no prior knowledge of extrinsic facts. Wilson would argue this was defamation PER SE.</p><p>Therefore, the remarks would reasonably be interpreted to be about Wilson.</p><p><b>4) Did Barbara PUBLISH her remarks?</b></p><p>Here Barbara clearly published her remarks because they were made \"on TV.\"</p><p><b>5) Were the statements DAMAGING TO REPUTATION?</b></p><p>A statement that Wilson had become an alcoholic would be damaging to reputation because alcoholism is generally seen as a character flaw and undesirable in a person placed in a position of responsibility.</p><p>Therefore, the remarks were damaging to reputation.</p><p><b>6) Did Wilson SUFFER DAMAGE?</b></p><p>Under the law of torts DEFAMATION PER QUOD requires proof of SPECIAL DAMAGES before GENERAL DAMAGES will be presumed. Special damages will be presumed in a slander per se concerning criminal acts, a loathsome disease, unchaste behavior or improper business practices.</p><p>Here Wilson might argue that the claim he was alcoholic is equivalent to accusation of a loathsome disease. Barbara would dispute this, but alcoholism often is seen as a disease that might cause others to avoid the plaintiff.</p><p>Barbara would argue that her statements were not defamatory on their face (not per se) because they involved innuendo and required interpretation. Wilson would dispute this.</p><p>Wilson would argue he had suffered SPECIAL DAMAGES because his \"popularity fell\" and he did not get a position he wanted. Barbara would argue that this did not damage Wilson because he was a \"former\" politician and \"almost a recluse.\" Further, she would argue that Wilson \"had little chance\" of getting the post, so her broadcast did not cause his loss.</p><p>Therefore, damages may be presumed, or Wilson may be able to prove damages.</p><p><b>7) Is Wilson a PUBLIC FIGURE PLAINTIFF?</b></p><p>Under New York Times v. Sullivan a plaintiff that is a public figure must prove actual malice, statements made with knowledge or reckless disregard for their falsity. A public figure is one who injects themselves into the public arena.</p><p>Here Wilson had been inactive in the public arena because he was \"almost a recluse\" and only a \"former governor.\" Barbara would argue that Wilson agreed to be \"interviewed at his home\" for a \"TV\" show, and hoped to become the \"State Republican Chair.\"</p><p>Therefore, Wilson had been in the public eye, was placing himself in the public arena by willingly being interviewed, and was a public figure.</p><p><b>8) Can Wilson prove ACTUAL MALICE?</b></p><p>Actual malice means statements made with knowledge of or reckless disregard for their falsity. Reckless disregard means intentionally acting without awareness and with negligent disregard for the clear and serious risk to others.</p><p>Here Barbara did not act with knowledge her statement was false because she \"suspected\" it was true. But there was a clear risk of injury to Wilson because she made comments \"on TV\" that would damage him.</p><p>Wilson would argue she acted with a reckless disregard of whether her comments were true or not because she had an opportunity to ask Wilson and \"did not ask.\"</p><p>Barbara would argue it was not reckless disregard because Wilson would only have denied drinking. She would show that no further effort on her part would have clarified the matter any further.</p><p>Therefore, Barbara probably would be held to have not acted with actual malice.</p><p><b>Definition 41.

Actress Ellen D. Generate was pursued relentlessly.</p><p>One time The National Inkwire reported that Ellen was secretly a generous philanthropist. In fact, Ellen was a tightwad. As a result of the Inkwire article, Ellen was besieged by requests for donations, and it was professionally impossible for her to turn them all down.</p><p>Then the Inkwire photographer, Dick took pictures of Ellen sunbathing topless on her sailboat. At the time the photo was taken Ellen was anchored four miles from land in international waters, and she had her friend Anne posted as a lookout to warn of any approaching boats or airplanes. The way Dick got the photo was by using a remote controlled, miniature submarine with a powerful telephoto lens.</p><p>Ellen was so embarrassed by the nude photo that she remained secluded in her home for weeks.</p><p>Ellen decided to sue the Inkwire, so she went to the grocery store and bought a copy of the issue with her photo to show her lawyer. Unfortunately Dick was following her and he took a picture of Ellen buying the Inkwire. Then Inkwire put the picture of Ellen on billboards nationwide with a caption that said \"Ellen D. Generate buys Inkwire!\"</p><p>Before Ellen could file suit the Inkwire ran an interview with Ellen\'s old boyfriend from college. He said that even though Ellen was now a strong and vocal anti-abortion advocate, she had an abortion herself in college. This was a true fact that Ellen had told her ex-boyfriend in strictest confidence. This disclosure embarrassed Ellen and made her look like a hypocrite.</p><p>Discuss the possible actions Ellen might bring against the Inkwire and their defenses.</p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question calls for discussion of each of the four Invasion of Privacy torts -- False Light, Appropriation of Likeness, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts (LAID).</p><p>The focus in intrusion and disclosure is on the unreasonableness of the acts of the defendant. It is not unreasonable to take a picture of a naked lady if she is lying on a public beach, but it is unreasonable to take the same picture by going to great lengths to avoid detection because it violates â€œreasonable expectations of privacyâ€.</p><p>The term â€œmoney damagesâ€ generally means an award intended to compensate the plaintiff for losses suffered in terms of property damage, lost income, inconvenience, lost privacy, embarrassment, pain and suffering, etc. But the plaintiff can also request damages measured by the unjust enrichment the defendant would otherwise reap. In that case the plaintiff is said to have, â€œwaived the tort and sued in restitutionâ€, and the damage award in that case is often referred to as â€œdamages in restitutionâ€. In most cases of False Light, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts the plaintiff is suing for compensatory damages, and in most cases of Appropriation of Likeness the plaintiff is suing for damages in restitution.</p><p>The term â€œdamagesâ€ is broadly misused to mean â€œmoney judgmentâ€ and students are strongly advised to get (and read) Nailing the Barâ€™s Simple Remedies Outline early in their law school career.]</p><p><b>Practice Answer 5: Invasion of Privacy</b></p><p><b>ELLEN v. INKWIRE </b></p><p><b>1) FALSE LIGHT?</b></p><p>Under tort law FALSE LIGHT is the intentional act of publishing a false portrayal of the plaintiff in a manner causing ridicule or embarrassment.</p><p>Here Inkwire published a portrayal about Ellen because it \"reported she was a secret philanthropist.\" This was a false portrayal because she was a \"tightwad.\" And this caused her embarrassment because she was \"besieged with requests\" that were \"professionally impossible\" to reject. Ellen\'s damages would generally be measured by the amount of embarrassment she was caused.</p><p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for invasion of privacy under a false light theory.</p><p><b>2) INTRUSION?</b></p><p>Under tort law INTRUSION is an unreasonable intrusion into the peace and solitude of the plaintiff. Damages are measured by the value of lost solitude to the plaintiff.</p><p>Here there was an unreasonable intrusion because Dick sent a \"submarine\" to photograph Ellen through a \"telephoto lens\". It disturbed her peace and solitude because she had attempted to be alone in a secluded place \"miles\" from shore with a \"posted lookout.\" Ellen suffered damages because it \"embarrassed her\" into \"seclusion\" in her home for \"six weeks.\"</p><p>Dick would argue that Ellen had no reasonable expectation of privacy because she was \"in international waters.\" Ellen would counter that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy because of the location and precautions she had taken.</p><p>Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for intrusion.</p><p><b>3) APPROPRIATION OF LIKENESS?</b></p><p>Under tort law APPROPRIATION is the unauthorized use of the name or likeness of a person in a manner that implies endorsement of a product or support of a cause, but not mere publication of names and photos as news articles. Damages are generally measured by the profit to the defendant.</p><p>Here there was a use of Ellen\'s photo and name because billboards with her \"picture\" said \"Ellen D. Generate\" buys their paper. And the use was not authorized because she did not give permission. The purpose of the billboards was to profit by implying she endorsed their paper.</p><p>Ellen\'s damages would generally be measured by the profits Inkwire made from using her likeness.</p><p><b>4) PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS?</b></p><p>Under tort law PUBLIC DISCLOSURE is the unreasonable public disclosure of private facts that a reasonable person would find embarrassing.</p><p>Here there was a public disclosure because Inkwire \"ran the interview\" in its publication. And the facts were private facts because they were told to the ex-boyfriend in \"strictest confidence.\" These were embarrassing facts because they concerned an \"abortion\", a matter of personal intimacy, and of a nature likely to cause public disdain and ridicule. Ellen would argue Inkwire acted in an unreasonable manner.</p><p>Inkwire would argue that it acted reasonably because these facts were a matter of legitimate public concern since Ellen had injected herself into the public arena as a \"strong and vocal anti- abortion advocate.\" Inkwire would argue the public had a right to know Ellen\'s true background since she sought to influence public opinion on this controversial topic.</p><p>Therefore, Ellen might fail to show Inkwire acted unreasonably.</p><p><b>Definition 45.

He moved to Sacramento and purchased a spacious home on the Sacramento River. He felt he got a great deal because he only paid $400,000 and a similar home in Los Angeles would have cost him three times that amount.</p><p>Ken realized his home was directly in the flight path of the airplanes taking off and landing from the County airport, and the realtor had prominently disclosed this fact on the sales documents. But Ken didn\'t think the noise was so bad because from his backyard he just loved to hear little birds singing along the public river parkway.</p><p>Four years later Ken lost the election and he wanted to move back to Los Angeles. When he had the house appraised, it was worth $500,000. Ken was furious because his home value had only increased 25 percent in value while most real estate had gone up 50 percent.</p><p>Ken blamed the County. In the four years he owned the home the number of flights at the airport increased ten percent. This increased traffic was from increased military use in response to the crisis in Romaria. Ken could not enjoy his yard as much as before, and the little birds on the public river parkway didn\'t seem to sing as much as they used to.</p><p>What actions might Ken bring against the County, what defenses might be raised, and what remedies are appropriate?</p><p>[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question is roughly based on true events.

Here Kenâ€™s case is rather weak, so you may have to give â€œconditionalâ€ conclusions.</p><p>Discussion of â€œdefensesâ€ and â€œremediesâ€ is mandatory because the CALL specifically asks for it.]</p><p><b>Sample Answer 6: Nuisance</b></p><p><b>KEN v. COUNTY</b></p><p><b>1) PRIVATE NUISANCE?</b></p><p>Under tort law PRIVATE NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiffsâ€™ use and enjoyment of their land.</p><p>Here there was some interference because the County airport caused \"noise\" that prevented Ken from \"enjoying his yard\" and \"hearing the birds.\" And this involved the use of Ken\'s land because it was his \"house\" and \"yard.\"</p><p>The two elements that would be most difficult to prove are whether Ken suffered significant damages, and whether the County action was unreasonable. The County would argue that the noise was insufficient interference to prevent Ken from enjoying his land because Ken \"didn\'t think the noise was so bad\" when he bought the house. He in effect CAME TO THE NUISANCE, and that fact suggests the situation was not as bad as Ken claims.</p><p>But Ken would try to prove that the interference was unreasonable because the County let flights increase â€œten percent\" in only \"four years.\"</p><p>The County would also argue it did not cause the nuisance, and had not acted irresponsibly. The County might argue it was not responsible because the increase in noise was caused by \"military use\" beyond their control. Alternatively, the County would argue that it acted reasonably because the flights were in response to the \"Romaria crisis.\"</p><p>Ken would argue he suffered damages because the value of his home was less that it otherwise would be. But the County would argue there was no proof of financial loss because the home had gone up in value and the claim of loss was speculative. Further, the County would argue there was no proof the birds did not sing as much as before.</p><p>Therefore, the County might be liable for private nuisance depending on whether Ken could prove these legal elements.</p><p><b>2) PUBLIC NUISANCE?</b></p><p>Under tort law PUBLIC NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff\'s use and enjoyment of public resources causing her particular injury that is different or greater than the general public.</p><p>Here the noise interferes with the enjoyment of public land because it prevents Ken from \"hearing the birds sing\" on the \"public river parkway.\"</p><p>The County may argue that Ken lacks standing because he does not suffer any injury that is different from any other member of the public. But Ken suffers particular injury because his home is \"on the river\" and he could hear the birds sing \"from his backyard.\"</p><p>Ken would have to prove the other elements of nuisance which are discussed above under private nuisance.</p><p>Therefore, the County may be liable for public nuisance, depending on whether Ken can prove the Countyâ€™s action is unreasonable and produces significant damages.</p><p><b>3) COMING TO THE NUISANCE?</b></p><p>Under tort law COMING TO THE NUISANCE is the defense that the plaintiff moved to the location where the condition complained of already existed. It is a complete bar in a MINORITY view, but in the MAJORITY view it is only a factor to be considered in determining damages.</p><p>Here Ken moved to the location because he \"purchased the home.\" And the condition already existed because he \"realized his home was in the flight path\" and the \"realtor disclosed the fact.\"</p><p>Ken would argue that even though problems existed when he bought the home, they worsened after that. Further, he would argue that in any event the County action is unreasonable per se.</p><p>Therefore, the court would consider Ken\'s coming to the nuisances only as a factor in determining damages in most States.</p><p><b>4) REMEDIES?</b></p><p>The REMEDIES for a nuisance action include both money damages and injunctive relief.</p><p>If the nuisance is a temporary situation money damages measured by the loss of use for the period of the nuisance will be an adequate remedy. If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive relief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, and the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the interests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive relief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property value caused by the nuisance.</p><p>Here the nuisance is a permanent condition, so the Court would consider injunctive relief. But the interest of third parties, people who use the airport, the military, and the County residents would be so significant the Court is unlikely to issue an injunction stopping the airport from continuing operations.</p><p>Therefore the Court would most likely award Ken money damages to reflect the loss of market value of his property caused by the increase in airport traffic.</p><p><b>Definition 47.

Star knew where there was a retail space for lease that would be a great place for a JavaManiac franchise. Buck told Star that she would be granted a JavaManiac license if the location was acceptable. Based on this Star described the location in detail and gave Buck its address. Buck said he would have someone \"check it out.\"</p><p>Buck had no intention of giving Star a franchise. He just wanted her to reveal the location. Based on Star\'s description it sounded perfect for a JavaManiac outlet, and Buck wanted to take the space himself.</p><p>Buck went to the location suggested by Star and saw that it was perfect for JavaManiac. He then contacted the owner, Jack. Jack said he already had tentatively promised the lease to someone named Star.

Then Buck looked at Jack very sincerely and said, \"I probably shouldn\'t say this, but I feel I have a duty to tell you that you don\'t want to lease to someone like Star.\"</p><p>Buck reported to Star that the location was unacceptable because it was too small to meet the secret JavaManiac minimum guidelines.</p><p>Star was very dejected and withdrew her offer to lease the space.

BUCK </p><p>1) FRAUD?</p><p>Under tort law FRAUD is based on false representations of fact by the defendant made knowingly with intent to deceive that are reasonably relied upon by the plaintiff causing damages.</p><p>Here Buck made a statement of fact when he said a franchise \"would be granted\" if the location was suitable, and that was false because he had â€œno intentionâ€ of granting Star a franchise. He intended to deceive because he wanted her to reveal the location, and Star reasonably relied on his representation because she did reveal the location. That caused her damages because Buck used the information to convince Jack not to lease the â€œperfect locationâ€ to Star.</p><p>Buck also made false statements when he told Star the location was \"too small for a franchise.\" He intended to deceive her so she would not go through with her lease plans. And she reasonably relied on that statement because she â€œwithdrewâ€ her offer to Jack. That caused her damages because she otherwise would have secured the lease.</p><p>Therefore, Star can prove the elements of fraud and Buck may be liable for the damages she suffered.</p><p>2) TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE?</p><p>Under tort law INTERFERENCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff\'s known business relationships causing damages.</p><p>Here Buck interfered with Star\'s business relationship with Jack by suggesting to him that \"Star drank\" and was a \"bad tenant choice\". Buck also interfered by telling Star the space was \"too small for a coffee shop\".</p><p>Buck did these acts knowing that he was interfering with the business relationship between Jack and Star because Jack had told him he, \"promised the location to Star.\" The acts were unreasonable because they were intentional false statements intended to damage Star. And they caused Star damages because it prevented her from completing the lease agreement with Jack.</p><p>Therefore, Buck can be liable for tortious interference.</p><p>3) ABUSE OF PROCESS?</p><p>Under tort law ABUSE OF PROCESS is bringing a civil action against the plaintiff without</p><p>legitimate basis out of malice and for an improper purpose.</p><p>Here Buck brought a civil action against Star because he \"sued Star for slander.\" And he had no legitimate basis because all of Star\'s statements were true. Buck acted out of malice and for an improper purpose because he was trying to refute Star\'s statements and hide the truth.</p><p>Therefore, Buck could be liable for abuse of process.</p><div><br></div>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-10-20 16:47:08', 1);

SOLICITATION?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a SOLICITATION is the crime of urging another person to commit a crime. </p><p>The crime of SOLICITATION is complete as soon as the urging takes place, whether the person urged commits the crime urged or not. But if the urged crime is committed the SOLICITATION MERGES into the criminal result and the person committing the solicitation becomes an ACCESSORY BEFORE THE FACT and VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for the crime based on accomplice theory.</p><p><b>Definition 2. CONSPIRACY?</b></p><p>Under COMMON LAW the crime of CONSPIRACY was an <b>agreement between two or more people</b> to work toward an <b>illegal goal</b>. MODERNLY an OVERT ACT in furtherance of the conspiracy goal is often required in many Courts.</p><p>Further, under the PINKERTON RULE, a member of a conspiracy is VICARIOUSLY LIABLE for the criminal acts of co-conspirators done WITHIN THE SCOPE of the conspiracy goal. This means crimes that were 1) foreseeable and 2) in furtherance of the conspiracy goal.</p><p>Even if the illegal goal of the conspiracy is attained, the CONSPIRACY DOES NOT MERGE into the criminal result, so each member can be convicted of both conspiracy and the other crimes committed during and within the scope of the conspiracy.</p><p>And under the WHARTON RULE a conspiracy requires the participation of more people than the minimum number necessary to commit the criminal act.</p><p>If a defendant joins a conspiracy in progress most Courts hold they are not liable for previous crimes of the co-conspirators unless the joining defendant seeks to profit from those prior crimes.</p><p>A conspiracy ends when the conspiracy goal is ATTAINED or ABANDONED, and vicarious liability will no longer attach based on conspiracy theory. But it may still attach based on accomplice theory.</p><p><b>Definition 3. CRIMINAL ASSAULT?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW an ASSAULT is the crime of acting with the intention of <b>causing a battery</b> or else to cause <b>apprehension of a battery</b>. The victim of the attempted battery does not have to be aware of the danger.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 4. CRIMINAL BATTERY?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a BATTERY is the crime of acting with the intention of<b> causing a touching of a victimâ€™s person</b> and causing a <b>harmful or offensive </b>touching .</p><p><b>Definition 5. RAPE?</b></p><p>Under common law RAPE was an intentional act to have sexual intercourse with a female without consent causing actual penetration, no matter how slight.</p><p><b>Definition 6. ARSON?</b></p><p>Under common law ARSON was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. MODERNLY arson is extended by statute to the burning of other structures. Malice for arson means that the burning must be done with wrongful intent.</p><p><b>Definition 7. LARCENY?</b></p><p>Under common law LARCENY was the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive. Where the possession was gained by misrepresentation it was called LARCENY BY TRICK.</p><p>Theft of property from a master or employer by a manager or high-level employee was generally embezzlement and not a larceny, unless the defendant got possession by misrepresentation, a larceny by trick. But theft of the same property by a servant or low-level employee was generally larceny, not embezzlement, unless the defendant took possession from a third party before deciding to steal it, and in that case it was embezzlement.</p><p>Under the RELATION BACK DOCTRINE some common law courts held that a theft of â€œlostâ€ property by a person who initially intended to return it to the lawful owner was a larceny because a later decision to steal RELATED BACK to make the original taking unlawful. But other courts held this was embezzlement on the theory the original taking formed a â€œconstructive trust.â€</p><p><b>Definition 8. FALSE PRETENSES ?</b></p><p>Under common law FALSE PRETENSES was the a MISREPRESENTATION of FACT to obtain TITLE to the property of another with intent to permanently deprive.</p><p><b>Definition 9. EMBEZZLEMENT?</b></p><p>Under common law EMBEZZLEMENT was the crime of TRESPASSORY <b>CONVERSION of the property</b> of another by <b>one entrusted with lawful possession</b> with <b>intent to permanently deprive</b> or causing substantial risk of loss.</p><p>Further, the COMMON CARRIER DOCTRINE held that a common carrier such as a taxicab, bus or ship is entrusted with possession of passengerâ€™s property, including lost property, so a theft of passenger property by an employee of a common carrier was more often held to be EMBEZZLEMENT than larceny, even if the property was â€œlostâ€.</p><p><b>Definition 10. ROBBERY?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a ROBBERY is a larceny from a person by use of <b>force</b> or fear to overcome the will of the victim to resist.</p><p><b>Definition 11. BURGLARY?</b></p><p>Under COMMON LAW a BURGLARY was the breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the night with intent to commit a felony. The entry of a structure within the CURTILAGE of the dwelling also constituted a burglary.</p><p>A physical breaking was generally required, but a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found if entry was the result of TRICK, VIOLENT THREATS, or CONSPIRACY.</p><p>MODERNLY burglary has been extended by statute to all times of the day and all types of structures. Intent to commit a larceny is generally still sufficient to support a burglary charge, even if the larceny is no longer a felony. Further, the â€œbreakingâ€ element will generally be satisfied if there is a TRESPASSORY ENTRY, an entry without consent, express or implied.</p><p><b>Definition 12. RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY is the crime of taking possession or control over <b>stolen personal property</b> while <b>knowing</b> it has been stolen with <b>intent to permanently deprive</b> the lawful owner.</p><p><b>Definition 13. ATTEMPTED?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW an ATTEMPTED CRIME is a SUBSTANTIAL STEP taken toward committing an INTENDED CRIME.</p><p><b>Definition 14. MURDER?</b></p><p>Under criminal law MURDER is an unlawful HOMICIDE, the killing of one human being by another, with MALICE aforethought. Malice for murder can be 1) express intent to kill or implied by 2) intent to cause great bodily injury, 3) intent to commit an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY MURDER RULE or 4) intent to act with awareness of and conscious disregard for an unreasonably high risk to human life, the DEPRAVED HEART theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Under common law there were no degrees of murder, but modernly FIRST DEGREE murder is 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) murder by enumerated means or 3) murder during enumerated dangerous felonies. All other murder is second degree.&nbsp;</p><p>The felony-murder rule applies to deaths caused by acts done during the RES GESTAE of an inherently dangerous felony, the events beginning with the first substantial step toward commission of the crime and ending when the defendants leave the scene of the crime and reach a place of relative safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Actual Cause:</p><p>Proximate Cause:</p><p><b>Definition 15. MITIGATING FACTORS?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, MITIGATING FACTORS are factual considerations that do not serve as complete defenses but may be weighed by the jury in determining whether murder should be found in the first or second degree, or whether a murder charge should be reduced to a finding of manslaughter.</p><p><b>Definition 16. VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</b></p><p>Under criminal law VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER&nbsp; is an unlawful, intentional homicide without malice aforethought because of adequate provocation sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a fit of rage which could and actually did cause the homicide.</p><p>ADEQUATE PROVOCATION is provocation sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a murderous rage, which did raise the defendant to such a rage, and which was the actual cause of the homicide.&nbsp;</p><p>But ADEQUATE PROVOCATION CANNOT BE FOUND if the defendant had enough time before the killing that a reasonable person would have COOLED DOWN and no longer would have been in a murderous rage.</p><p><b>Definition 17. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</b></p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide resulting from GROSS NEGLIGENCE, RECKLESSNESS or the commission of a MALUM IN SE crime insufficient to support the felony murder rule.</p><p>GROSS (CRIMINAL) NEGLIGENCE is the <b>deliberate breach of a pre-existing duty to protect others from extreme risks</b>, and RECKLESSNESS is the <b>deliberate creation of extreme risks</b> to others.</p><p><b>Definition 18. REDLINE RULE?</b></p><p>Under the REDLINE RULE the killing of a criminal accomplice by any party other than another criminal accomplice during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony cannot be used as basis for charging murder under the FELONY-MURDER RULE.</p><p><b>Definition 19. KIDNAPPING?</b></p><p>Under criminal law, a KIDNAPPING is the unlawful taking or confining of a person against their will.</p><p><b>Definition 20. MISPRISION?</b></p><p>Under the common law MISPRISION was the crime of knowingly failing to report felonies by others to the police.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 21. COMPOUNDING?</b></p><p>Under criminal law COMPOUNDING is the crime of taking money or something of value in exchange for a promise to not report crimes committed by others.</p><p><b>Definition 22. ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY?</b></p><p>An accomplice to a crime may be charged with all subsequent crimes committed by other accomplices if they were foreseeable as the direct and natural results of their own criminal acts.</p><p><b>Definition 23. DEFENSE of INFANCY?</b></p><p>Under the COMMON LAW there as a CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION that a child under the age of seven was unable to form CRIMINAL INTENT. There was a REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION that a child between 7 and 14 could not form criminal intent, and a child over the age of 14 was believed to be able to form criminal intent.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 24. DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF FACT?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a MISTAKE OF FACT is a complete defense if it negates implied criminal intent. For GENERAL INTENT crimes only a REASONABLE mistake can negate criminal intent. For SPECIFIC INTENT crimes ANY MISTAKE OF FACT may negate criminal intent whether reasonable or not. Battery, rape, arson, involuntary manslaughter and murders that are not willful and deliberate are general intent crimes. All other crimes are SPECIFIC INTENT crimes.</p><p>A REASONABLE MISTAKE OF FACT is one that a reasonable person would have made in the same situation. VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION never makes an otherwise unreasonable mistake reasonable.</p><p>A MISTAKE OF FACT is no defense to a charge of ATTEMPT if criminal intent is proven and the mistake merely prevented an otherwise criminal act.</p><p><b>Definition 25. DEFENSE of LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY means that an attempted act is not an attempted crime, even if there was criminal intent, when the attempted crime is a legal impossibility at the time of the first substantial step.</p><p><b>Definition 26. DEFENSE of MISTAKE OF LAW?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, A MISTAKE OF LAW about the legality of an act does not alter the legality of the act. If the defendant commits a criminal act believing it is legal, it is still an illegal act. Likewise, if the defendant commits a legal act believing it is illegal, it is still a legal act.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 27. DEFENSE of FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, FACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY is a defense that the act actually done by the defendant was NOT A SUBSTANTIAL STEP toward commission of any crime, despite criminal intent, because the act taken could never produce a criminal result.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Definition 28. DEFENSE of WITHDRAWAL?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW, WITHDRAWAL is a defense that defendants who were members of a CONSPIRACY are not liable for crimes committed by co-conspirators AFTER the defendants 1) give the other co-conspirators NOTICE that they are abandoning the conspiracy and 2) the defendants TRY TO STOP the co-conspirators from continuing pursuing the conspiracy goal.</p><p><b>Definition 29. DEFENSE of INSANITY?</b></p><p>Under criminal law INSANITY is a defense that negates criminal intent. Under the M\'NAUGHTEN RULE&nbsp; person is insane if a disease of the mind so impairs their reasoning that they are unable to appreciate the nature and quality of their acts or to know that they were wrong. Under the IRRESISTIBILE IMPULSE theory a person may raise the defense of insanity if they are unable to control their acts, even if they know the act is wrong</p><p><b>Definition 30. DEFENSE of CONSENT?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW consent is a defense to some crimes.[rape, larceny, battery â€“ consent to a touching] The consent must be informed, voluntary and given by one with legal capacity. Further, consent is not a defense to an act that causes great bodily harm.</p><p><b>Definition 31. DEFENSE of ENTRAPMENT?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW entrapment is a defense if criminal intent was the product of improper police behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the majority view entrapment is no defense if the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime. Under another minority view entrapment is a defense if police conduct was outrageous and instigated the crime, even though the defendant was predisposed.</p><p><b>Definition 32. DEFENSE of DURESS?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defense may be raised to crimes, EXCEPT MURDER, that the criminal act was the result of DURESS.</p><p><b>Definition 33. DEFENSE of NECESSITY?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defense of NECESSITY may be raised to certain crimes.</p><p>This defense is really nothing more than self-defense, defense of others, or defense of property.</p><p><b>Definition 34. PREVENTION OF CRIME (AUTHORITY OF LAW)?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defendant is privileged to act with reasonable force to PREVENT SERIOUS CRIMES being committed in their presence.</p><p><b>Definition 35. SELF-DEFENSE?</b></p><p>Under criminal law a defendant is privileged to use reasonable force as necessary for SELF-DEFENSE.</p><p><b>Definition 36. DEFENSE of OTHERS?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defendant is privileged to act with reasonable force to protect others from an aggressor. Courts are split when a defendant mistakenly aids an aggressor. Some Courts say the defendant who mistakenly aids an aggressor STEPS-INTO-THE-SHOES of the aggressor and cannot claim any defense. Other Courts hold that a defendant can claim this defense if they acted on REASONABLE APPEARANCES.</p><p><b>Definition 37. DEFENSE of PROPERTY?</b></p><p>Under CRIMINAL LAW a defendant is privileged to use reasonable, non-deadly force to protect his own property or the property of others from harm.</p><p><b>Definition 38. Malicious mischief</b></p><p><b>Definition 39. DEFENSE OF INTOXICATION</b></p><p><b>Practice Question 16-1</b></p><p>Tom and Dick burst into the 7-11 store in Sacramento through the open door with their guns drawn at midnight. They wanted to rob the store the first night it opened.</p><p>â€œStick â€˜em up,â€ yelled Tom.</p><p>Unfortunately, the store was empty because they made a big mistake. No one was there. There was no merchandise. The store wasnâ€™t going to open until the next week.</p><p>They were so mad they ripped the security camera off the wall and threw it in the river.</p><p>The next morning Tom and Dick saw themselves on the Dumb Crook Show on TV. The store security camera had filled them trying to rob the empty store. They were afraid they would be caught. So to escape Tom drove real fast to San Francisco with Dick as his passenger.</p><p>One the freeway going 75 mph, Tom was distracted and accidentally bumped Victoriaâ€™s car. She was only going 70 mph, the posted limit. She spun out of control and crashed. She survived, but went into labor, and her full-term, viable baby was born dead.</p><p>Tom then got off the freeway and drove down the crowded city surface streets of San Francisco at 80 mph. Dick was silent. The posted limit was 25 miles per hour. The car ran over homeless person Victor. He died instantly.</p><p>Discuss the possible charges against Tom and Dick.</p><p><b>Sample Answer 15-1: Attempt, Homicide, Res Gestae, Depraved Heart</b></p><p><b>STATE V. TOM</b></p><p><b>1. CONSPIRACY?</b></p><p>Under common law a CONSPIRACY is an agreement between two or more people to work toward an illegal goal. Modernly an overt step toward the criminal goal is often required. Conspiracy does not merge into the ultimate crime.</p><p>Here there was an implied agreement between Tom and Dick, two people, for an illegal goal, because they â€œburstâ€ into the store together and â€œwanted to robâ€ the store. They committed an overt step toward their goal because of this.</p><p>Therefore Tom can be charged with conspiracy.</p><p><b>2. ATTEMPTED ROBBERY?</b></p><p>Under criminal law an ATTEMPTED ROBBERY is committed with there is a SUBSTANTIAL STEP taken toward committing a robbery. A robbery is a LARCENY, a trespassory taking of personal property with an intent to permanently deprive, from a person by force or fear overcoming the will of the victim to resist.</p><p>Here Tom took a SUBSTANTIAL STEP toward completing the robbery because he went to the store â€œwith a gunâ€ and â€œburstâ€ through the door. And his goal was the crime of robbery because he â€œwanted to robâ€ the store.</p><p>Therefore, Tom can be charged with attempted robbery.</p><p><b>3. DEFENSE OF MISTAKE OF FACT?</b></p><p>Under criminal law a mistake of fact is a valid defense if it NEGATES IMPLIED CRIMINAL INTENT. Attempt is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime, so any mistake of fact that negates criminal intent is a valid defense.</p><p>Here Tom made a mistake because he thought the store was open for business, but that mistake does not negate intent because he â€œwanted to robâ€ the store.</p><p>Therefore, Tomâ€™s mistake of fact does not negate his criminal intent, and his defense argument fails.</p><p><b>4. BURGLARY?</b></p><p>Under the common law a burglary was a breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony. Further, a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found if an entry was made by trick, threat of violence or with the help of a conspirator. MODERNLY burglary has been extended to almost any structure and all times of the day. If a larceny is not a felony, it still supports a charge of burglary. And modernly a constructive breaking will be found if there is any TRESPASSORY ENTRY, an entry without permission, express or implied.</p><p>Here there was no entry to a dwelling, and the entry was through an â€œopenâ€ door. Therefore, no common law burglary occurred. But there was an entry to a structure because they entered a â€œstoreâ€ and it was with intent to commit a felony because they â€œwanted to robâ€ the store. Finally, a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found modernly because their entry was trespassory. It was trespassory because the store was not open for business, and they had no permission to enter it, either expressly or impliedly.</p><p>Therefore they could be charged with burglary modernly but could not have been charged at common law.</p><p><b>5. LARCENY?</b></p><p>Under common law LARCENY was the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive. Modernly it is codified as â€œtheftâ€.</p><p>At common law some Courts held that property attached to the land could not be the subject of a larceny because it was real property and not personal property. Other courts disagreed, and modernly all courts would hold that when property is severed from the land to be stolen it is transformed from real property to personal property and can then be the subject of a larceny.</p><p>Here Tom took and carried personal property of another because he â€œripped the security cameraâ€ from the wall and took it to the â€œriverâ€, and he intended to permanently deprive because he threw it in the river.</p><p>Therefore Tom can be charged with larceny.</p><p><b>6. MURDER OF THE BABY?</b></p><p>MURDER is an unlawful HOMICIDE, the killing of one human being by another with MALICE AFORETHOUGHT. MALICE for murder can be 1) an express INTENT TO KILL, or implied by 2) intent to commit GREAT BODILY INJURY, 3) a homicide caused by commission of an INHERENTLY DANGEROUS FELONY, the â€œFELONY MURDER RULEâ€ or 3) DELIBERATE CREATION OF EXTREME RISKS to human life with AWARENESS of the risks and a CONSCIOUS DISREGARD for them, the â€œDEPRAVED HEARTâ€ murder.</p><p>Under the common law and broadly adopted modern law a HUMAN BEING is a person that has been born alive and is not yet dead. About half the States have adopted FETAL-MURDER statutes which define the killing of a fetus with malice aforethought punishable as a murder, but they vary widely. The death of a fetus cannot qualify as a manslaughter.</p><p>Murder may be charged under the FELONY-MURDER RULE if a death is caused by the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, but only if the death is caused by acts done during the RES GESTAE of the underlying felony. The RES GESTAE of a crime is the sequence of events from the first substantial step to committing the crime and ending when the defendants leave the scene of the crime and reach a place of relative safety.</p><p>Here there was no homicide because the baby was â€œborn deadâ€ and not born alive. But this may be defined as a murder under a fetal-murder statute in some States because the fetus was \"full term.\"</p><p>Even if this State had a fetal-murder statute, malice for murder could not be based on intent to kill, intent to cause great bodily injury or depraved heart because the collision was by \"accident\" and at a reasonable speed of \"75\".</p><p>Further, malice could not be based on the felony-murder rule because the death occurred after the res gestae the attempted robbery had ended. It ended when they at a place of â€œrelative safetyâ€ and were able to watch â€œTVâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Tom cannot be charged with murder because there is no basis for finding malice, even if there was a fetal-murder statute.</p><p><b>7. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.</b></p><p>Under criminal law INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is an UNINTENTIONAL homicide without malice aforethought resulting from GROSS NEGLIGENCE, RECKLESSNESS or the commission of a MALUM IN SE CRIME that is not inherently dangerous enough for application of the felony murder rule.</p><p>GROSS (CRIMINAL) NEGLIGENCE is the deliberate breach of a pre-existing duty to protect others from extreme risks, and RECKLESSNESS is the deliberate creation of extreme risks to others.</p><p>As discussed above, the death of a fetus does not qualify as a manslaughter. Therefore, Tomâ€™s act was not sufficient to charge him with involuntary manslaughter.</p><p><b>8. MURDER of Victor?</b></p><p>Murder, defined above, can be based on the DEPRAVED HEART doctrine where one acts unreasonably to DELIBERATELY CREATE EXTREME RISKS TO OTHERS, the actus reus, with AWARENESS of the risks and a CONSCIOUS DISREGARD for the risks, the mens rea.</p><p>Here Tom caused a homicide because he killed Victor, a human being. And he deliberately created extreme risks because he drove down the â€œcrowded surface streetsâ€ at â€œ80 mphâ€.</p><p>Further, he was aware of the risks because he was in full control of his faculties. And he consciously disregarded the risks because he continued to do this without any compelling reason. Therefore, Tom can be charged with the murder of Victor.</p><p><b>STATE V. DICK.</b></p><p><b>9. CONSPIRACY, ATTEMPTED ROBBERY, BURGLARY and LARCENY?</b></p><p>Dick was an equal participant in the crimes of conspiracy, attempted robbery, burglary and larceny, and did all of the same things as Tom relative to these acts.</p><p>Therefore Dick was DIRECTLY LIABLE and could be charged with each of these crimes on the same facts and legal theories as explained for Tom above.</p><p><b>10. MURDER of Victor?</b></p><p>Tom killed Victor and not Dick, and since â€œDick was silentâ€ and not urging Tom to run over Victor or do anything criminal, Dick could only be charged with this murder based on a vicarious liability theory. There are two vicarious liability theories: conspiracy theory and accomplice theory.</p><p>CONSPIRACY THEORY? A person may be charged with vicarious liability for a crime based on CONSPIRACY THEORY if while they are a member of a conspiracy a co-conspirator commits the crime within the scope of the conspiracy. But a conspiracy ends when the criminal goal is ATTAINED or ABANDONED.</p><p>Here Dick was a member of a conspiracy to rob the store, but that conspiracy goal was abandoned when they found the store closed. Since the conspiracy had ended, Tom did not kill Victor the next day â€œwithin the scopeâ€ of the conspiracy.</p><p>Therefore Dick cannot be charged on this basis.</p><p>ACCOMPLICE THEORY? A person who commits or helps commit a crime is liable for all subsequent crimes by co-felons that are a direct and natural result of the prior crimes.</p><p>Here Dick helped Tom try to rob the store the prior day, so he would be liable for any crimes by Tom that are a direct and natural result of the attempted robbery. But the murder of Victor was not a foreseeable result of the prior robbery attempt.</p><p>Therefore Dick cannot be charged with Victorâ€™s death based on accomplice liability. Since Dick had no direct liability or vicarious liability he cannot be charged with Murder.</p><p>[<b>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</b> The main points here are that:</p><p>1) Modernly a burglary generally requires a trespassory entry, an entry without permission to enter, and does not necessarily require a physical breaking. 2) A fetus is not generally considered a human being.</p><p>3) There are fetal-murder statutes you might need to discuss, but there are no â€œfetal-manslaughterâ€ statutes (or if there are it is extremely unusual).</p><p>4) The felony-murder rule cannot be applied to a death that results from acts done so long after the robbery that they were not part of the res gestae of the crime.</p><p>5) There is no conspiracy liability for crimes committed by co-conspirators after the conspiracy has ended.</p><p>6) Accomplices in one crime are not automatically liable for all subsequent crimes committed by other accomplices, even if they are committed in their presence unless there is some direct and natural causality linking the second crime back to the first crime.]</p><p><b>Practice Question 16-2</b></p><p>Huey and Louie agreed to kidnap Frank\'s daughter, Millie, and hold her for ransom. Frank was an old movie star with lots of money.</p><p>Huey knew that Louie was a convicted rapist, so he said, \"Louie! I want you to swear that you won\'t touch this girl. Because we are just in this for the ransom. Nothing else. And if you do anything bad to her, that is going to hurt our chances to get the ransom. So, do you swear?\"</p><p>Louie said, \"Huey, I swear on a stack of bibles I won\'t touch the dame.\"</p><p>So Huey and Louie kidnapped Millie and held her for ransom in a rundown motel.</p><p>Huey went to the store for smokes and when he came back he discovered Louie had sex with Millie by telling her he would let her go in exchange. He was furious and afraid. He said, \"Louie, I quit. I ain\'t having nothing to do with this no more!\"</p><p>Huey left and went to a bar where he got very drunk. That night Millie became so despondent over allowing Louie to have intercourse with her she hung herself in the bathroom of the motel room while Louie was snoring in the bed.</p><p>Police discovered where Louie was and surrounded the motel room the next morning. Louie vowed not to be taken alive and was gunned down by the cops.</p><p>Huey woke up at noon. Unaware of what happened to Millie and Louie, he decided to turn himself in. So he went to the police that morning and told them everything he knew in an effort to help rescue Millie.</p><p>What crimes can Huey be charged with?</p><p><b>Sample Answer 15-2: Accomplice and Conspiracy Liability</b></p><p><b>STATE V. HUEY</b></p><p><b>1) CONSPIRACY?</b></p><p>Under common law a CONSPIRACY was an agreement between two or more people to pursue an illegal goal. Modernly an overt step taken toward the criminal goal is often required. Conspiracy does not merge into the criminal goal. A conspirator may be charged with all crimes by co- conspirators while they are members of the conspiracy that are within the scope of the conspiracy agreement, foreseeable acts in furtherance of the conspiracy goal.</p><p>Here Huey agreed with another person because he \"agreed\" with \"Louie\", and the agreement was to pursue an illegal goal because it was to \"kidnap Millie\" and hold her for ransom. They took an overt step because they did kidnap her.</p><p>Therefore, Huey can be charged with conspiracy.</p><p><b>2) EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW from the conspiracy?</b></p><p>Under criminal law EFFECTIVE WITHDRAWAL from a conspiracy is a defense to liability for subsequent crimes by co-conspirators if the defendant gives notice to the other conspirators of intent to withdraw and then the defendant must act to thwart the conspiracy from attaining its goal.</p><p>Here Huey gave notice because he told Louie \"I quit.\" And he acted to thwart the conspiracy because he \"told the police.\"</p><p>However, Huey did not act to thwart the conspiracy until after the kidnapping, rape and death of Millie. Withdrawal only is a defense to subsequent crimes by co-conspirators and here the withdrawal was not effective until after all crimes had been committed.</p><p>Therefore, Huey effectively withdrew from the conspiracy when he told the police everything, but that did not absolve him from crimes that occurred before that time.</p><p><b>3) KIDNAPPING?</b></p><p>Under criminal law a KIDNAPPING is the unlawful taking or confining of a person against their will.</p><p>Here Huey took and confined Millie against her will because he and Louie â€œkidnapped Millieâ€. Therefore, Huey can be charged with kidnapping.</p><p><b>4) RAPE under a theory of ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY?</b></p><p>Under criminal law RAPE is unlawful intercourse with a person without consent. An accomplice to a crime may be charged with all subsequent crimes committed by other accomplices if they were foreseeable as the direct and natural results of their own criminal acts.</p><p>Here Louie had intercourse with Millie because they \"had sex.\" And it was without consent because Millie only agreed to intercourse because she had been kidnapped and Louie said he \"would let her go in exchange.\" Since she was being held against her will and under duress, her apparent consent to intercourse was not effective.</p><p>Therefore, Louie raped Millie, and that rape was foreseeable to Huey as a direct and natural consequence of his own crime of kidnapping Millie. This was all direct and natural, and should have been foreseeable to Huey because he knew \"Louie was a convicted rapist.\"</p><p>Therefore, Huey may be charged with the rape of Millie under a theory of accomplice liability.</p><p>5) MURDER of Millie?</p><p>Under criminal law murder is an unlawful homicide, the killing of one human being by another with malice aforethought. Malice for murder may be 1) express intent to kill, or implied by 2) intentionally causing great bodily injury, 3) intentionally committing an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY-MURDER RULE, or 4) intentionally acting with an awareness of and conscious disregard for unreasonable risks to human life, the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY. At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) by enumerated means, or 3) caused by the commission of enumerated dangerous felonies. All other murders are in the second degree.</p><p>Under criminal law one of the â€œinherently dangerous feloniesâ€ for application of the felony- murder rule is RAPE.</p><p>Here there was a homicide because Millie was a human being and she died as a result of the acts of Louie.</p><p>Huey would argue that Millie committed suicide and not homicide. But her death by her own hand was directly caused by the rape by Louie. She would not have killed herself if she had not been raped, and she would not have been raped if Huey had not kidnapped her and left her with Louie. The rape by Louie was foreseeable to Huey at the time of the kidnapping, so his own acts were the actual and proximate cause of her death. Huey and Louie effectively caused Millie to be the instrumentality of her own death.</p><p>Further, because Huey acted to place Millie at peril, he had an affirmative duty to protect her from the results of that peril, including protecting her from both Louie and her own suicidal impulses.</p><p>Therefore, the state would successfully argue that this was a homicide and not a simple suicide.</p><p>And the state would argue the FELONY-MURDER RULE applies to prove malice aforethought for murder because Millie died because of the commission of an inherently dangerous crime, rape.</p><p>As an alternative, the State may also argue that DEPRAVED HEART THEORY applies. Huey kidnapped Millie and left her with Louie, deliberate acts that created extreme risks to human life, and he did that with an awareness of and conscious disregard for the risk to human life because he knew Louie was a â€œrapistâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Huey could be charged with murder on a FELONY-MURDER or DEPRAVED HEART theory.</p><p><b>6) MURDER of Louie?</b></p><p>Under the REDLINE RULE the killing of a criminal accomplice by any party other than another criminal accomplice during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony cannot be used as a basis for charging murder under the FELONY-MURDER RULE.</p><p>Here there was a homicide because Louie was a human being and he was \"killed by police.\" But the police shooting of Louie was a justified act to prevent a felony.</p><p>Therefore, Huey cannot be charged with FELONY-MURDER of Louie.</p><p>[<b>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</b> This question points out two issues. Conspiracy liability only extends to acts within the SCOPE OF THE CONSPIRACY, meaning they must be foreseeable acts in furtherance of the conspiracy goal. But, accomplice liability extends to all foreseeable crimes by co-felons that are a direct and natural result of an initial crime. Here the rape is a direct and natural result of the kidnapping, so Huey is liable based on accomplice theory even if he is not liable based on conspiracy theory.</p><p>Secondly, Huey failed to effectively withdraw by acting to thwart the conspiracy, so he ends up liable for crimes that occurred after he said, \"I quit.\"</p><p>But Huey cannot be charged with murder for the death of Louie (in many or most States) because of the Redline Rule.]</p><p><b>Practice Question 16-3</b></p><p>Tom and his lover Dick made frequent trips to Mexico.

TOM </b></p><p><b>1) MURDER?</b></p><p>Under criminal law MURDER is an unlawful HOMICIDE, the killing of one human being by another, with MALICE aforethought. Malice for murder can be 1) express intent to kill or implied by 2) intent to cause great bodily injury, 3) intent to commit an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY MURDER RULE or 4) intent to act with awareness of and conscious disregard for an unreasonably high risk to human life, the DEPRAVED HEART theory.</p><p>Under common law there were no degrees of murder, but modernly FIRST DEGREE murder is 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) murder by enumerated means or 3) murder during enumerated dangerous felonies. All other murder is second degree.</p><p>Here there was a homicide because Dick was a human being and he was â€œkilledâ€ by another human being, Oscar. But Tom did not do anything intending to cause Dick or anyone else to be killed or intending to cause great bodily injury to anyone.</p><p>Further, Tom was not engaged in commission of an â€œinherently dangerous felonyâ€ at the time so the felony-murder rule has no application. Therefore the only basis for charging Tom with murder would be the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY.</p><p>Tom did not deliberately create extreme risks to other people. He could not have reasonably foreseen Oscar would start shooting. Even if some danger could have been foreseen, Tom was not aware of it and did not consciously disregard the risks because he was â€œin a dazeâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Tom did not appear to deliberately create and consciously disregard extreme risks to others, and cannot be charged with murder under the DEPRAVED HEART theory unless that could be proven.</p><p>If murder could be charged here, it would be second degree murder because the death was not willful and deliberate, during a typically enumerated felony or by a typically enumerated means.</p><p><b>2) INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</b></p><p>Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide resulting from GROSS NEGLIGENCE, RECKLESSNESS or the commission of a MALUM IN SE crime insufficient to support the felony murder rule.</p><p>GROSS (CRIMINAL) NEGLIGENCE is the deliberate breach of a pre-existing duty to protect others from extreme risks, and RECKLESSNESS is the deliberate creation of extreme risks to others.</p><p>Here there was an unintentional homicide because Dick died and Tom did not intend for him to die. And Tom was not committing any crime because smuggling Viagra was \"not a crime.\" The MISTAKE OF LAW by Tom does not make an otherwise innocent act a crime.</p><p>Further, resisting unlawful arrest is not a crime. Here the arrest was unlawful because there was â€œno probable cause\" and the police wanted to \"harass\" and \"beat\" Tom and Dick. And Tom was not grossly negligent because he drove â€œ55 mphâ€ and did not deliberately create extreme risks to others.</p><p>The State could only argue that Tom created extreme risks by refusing to stop his car, but he did not deliberately create those risks because he had an â€œoverwhelming phobiaâ€, was â€œscared to deathâ€ and â€œcould not bring himself to stopâ€ the car.</p><p>Therefore, Tom could not be charged with involuntary manslaughter unless it could be proven his failure to stop was criminally negligent.</p><p><b>3) SELF-DEFENSE?</b></p><p>Under criminal law a defendant is privileged to use reasonable force as necessary for SELF- DEFENSE.</p><p>Here Tom acted to <b>defend himself </b>from harm because he was â€œscared to deathâ€ and Oscar wanted to \"beat him.\" Oscar had no <b>legal right</b> to stop Tom because he had no probable cause. And Tom acted reasonably and used reasonable force because he only â€œdrove at 55 mphâ€.</p><p>The state may argue Tom acted unreasonably by refusing to stop, even if the police lacked probable cause, but there is no legal basis for such a claim.</p><p>Therefore, Tom would succeed in his defense that he acted in reasonable self-defense. </p><p><b>4) INSANITY?</b></p><p>Under criminal law INSANITY is a defense that negates criminal intent. Under the Mâ€™NAUGHTEN RULE a person is insane if a disease of the mind so impairs their reasoning that they are unable to appreciate the nature and quality of their acts or to know that they are wrong. Under the IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE theory a person may raise the defense of insanity if they are unable to control their acts, even if they know the act is wrong.</p><p>Here Tom could not plead Mâ€™Naughten because â€œhe knew it was wrongâ€. But Tom could plead an irresistible impulse because â€œhe had an overwhelming phobiaâ€ and â€œhe could not help himselfâ€.</p><p>Therefore, Tom might be successful with an insanity defense.</p><p>[<b>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</b> This question is quirky so paddling is necessary. Even if Tom and Dick were committing a crime it was not one of the â€œinherently dangerous crimes of rape, robbery, burglary or arsonâ€ so the felony-murder rule has no application here.</p><p>Tom could only be charged under Depraved Heart. For that it must be shown he created extreme risks to others with an awareness of the risks and a conscious disregarded for them. But how could he have foreseen Oscar was crazy enough to shoot Dick?

JIM&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>1) ARSON?</b></p><p>Under common law ARSON was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another.

Modernly it is defined as THEFT. Under the RELATION BACK doctrine some courts held that an initial taking of lost property with intent to return property to the owner becomes trespassory when a later decision to steal â€œrelates backâ€ to the original taking. Other courts held that the finder of lost property holds it in â€œCONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTâ€ for the rightful owner and a later taking was an EMBEZZLEMENT.</p><p>Here Jim took and carried personal property of another because he \"picked up\" and \"took\" the \"wallet belonging to Sue.\" However, at the time Jim took the wallet he did not have any intent to permanently deprive so that taking was not trespassory.</p><p>Later Jim formed a larcenous intent when he became \"depressed\", \"pocketed Sue\'s money\" and \"threw\" the wallet into the river. This was a trespassory taking and Jim clearly intended to permanently deprive because he threw the wallet into the river. This larcenous intent related back to the original taking under the RELATION BACK doctrine.</p><p>Therefore, Jim can be charged with larceny in a Court that recognizes the RELATION BACK theory.</p><p><b>3) EMBEZZLEMENT of wallet?</b></p><p>Under criminal law EMBEZZLEMENT is an intentional trespassory conversion of personal property of another by one entrusted with lawful possession. Modernly it is defined as THEFT.</p><p>As stated above, some Courts held that a decision to keep lost property after originally intending to return it was an EMBEZZLEMENT based on CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST THEORY.</p><p>Here there was no trespassory taking of the wallet because Jim â€œintended to returnâ€ it. Once he had the wallet he held it in constructive trust. But there was a trespassory conversion with intent to deprive because he decided to keep the money.</p><p>Therefore Jim could be charged with embezzlement in a Court that holds to the CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST THEORY.</p><p><b>4) EMBEZZLEMENT of $10? </b></p><p>Embezzlement is defined above.</p><p>Here Jim was entrusted with possession because Chester \"gave him $10 to buy tickets.\" This was personal property because it was money.

It is not arson to burn a building by accident unless the fire was not set for a \"malicious\" purpose.</p><p>Malice for arson means for a \"wrongfulâ€ but not necessarily illegal purpose. The purpose for the fire is malicious if the defendant started it to injure or frighten people or to damage their property. If a fire is set to clear brush on the defendantâ€™s land and for no other purpose it is not malicious, even if the fire violated local burn-control laws. But if the fire is set to cause hurt, disruption, annoyance, etc. then the purpose is wrongful and malicious.</p><p>Defendants who take property intending to return it are not guilty of a larceny at the time of the taking, but it becomes larceny (under the â€˜relation backâ€™ view) if the defendant later decides to keep the property. Some Courts held that lost property taken with intent to return it is held in â€˜constructive trustâ€™ so a subsequent keeping of the property was embezzlement.

It turned out the \"grass\" really was grass -- lawn clippings from the dude\'s back yard.</p><p>What crimes can Yang be charged with and what defenses might be raised?</p><p><b>Sample Answer 15-5: Attempt, Mistake of Fact, Mistake of Law</b></p><p><b>STATE v. YANG</b></p><p><b>1) LARCENY from the \"Hot Tomato\"?</b></p><p>Under criminal law LARCENY is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with an intent to permanently deprive. Modernly it is defined as THEFT.</p><p>Here Yang took and carried personal property of another because he \"deftly lifted\" the \"wallet.\" Yang\'s intent to permanently deprive is implied by the facts.</p><p>This was a larceny but not a robbery because he did not use force or fear. Therefore, Yang can be charged with larceny.</p><p><b>2) ROBBERY of the Old Lady?</b></p><p>Under criminal law ROBBERY is a larceny, the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, from the person by means of force or fear overcoming the will of the victim to resist.</p><p>Here Yang took and carried personal property of another because he \"snatched a purse\" and \"rode away with the prize.\" Yang\'s intent to permanently deprive is implied by the facts.</p><p>This was a larceny from the person because the Old Lady was \"holding tight\" until she \"lost her grip\". And he used force to overcome the will of the victim to resist because he used force to break the Old Lady\'s \"grip\".</p><p>Therefore, Yang can be charged with robbery.</p><p><b>3) ATTEMPTED ROBBERY or ATTEMPTED LARCENY of the Chick?</b></p><p>Under criminal law an ATTEMPTED CRIME is a SUBSTANTIAL STEP toward committing a crime, with intent to commit the crime. Both LARCENY and ROBBER are defined above.</p><p>Here a SUBSTANTIAL STEP was taken toward LARCENY because Yang \"reached out to snag another purse\" and he clearly intended to take and carry away the purse to permanently deprive the Chick of it.</p><p>Therefore Yang can clearly be charged with ATTEMPTED LARCENY.</p><p>But there was also an IMPLIED INTENT that Yang intended to commit a larceny by force or fear because he had just previously robbed the \"Old Lady\" and that prior act showed he had no intention of letting go of the Chickâ€™s purse if she resisted his attempt to take it.</p><p>Therefore, Yang can be charged with ATTEMPTED ROBBERY and it would be up to the jury to decide if there was adequate evidence of intent to rob the Chick if she resisted his efforts to take her purse.</p><p><b>4) MISTAKE OF FACT as a defense to ATTEMPTED LARCENY or ROBBERY?</b></p><p>Under criminal law MISTAKE OF FACT is a defense that the defendant did not have the necessary intent because he either did not intend to commit the criminal act (GENERAL INTENT crimes) or to cause the criminal result (SPECIFIC INTENT crimes.)</p><p>Here Yang reached out to take a purse that did not exist. He clearly had an intent to commit a larceny or robbery. He might argue that the Chick did not have a purse so it would have been impossible for him to commit a crime. But ATTEMPT is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime so Yang would have to show he did not have any intent to cause a criminal result.</p><p>Since intent to cause a criminal result is shown, Yang could not use mistake of fact as an effective defense.</p><p><b>5) MISTAKE OF LAW as to the drugs?</b></p><p>Under criminal law a MISTAKE OF LAW about the legality of an intended act does not alter the legality of the attempted or committed act.</p><p>Here Yang attempted to buy a bag of \"grass\" that truly was grass. He intended to commit an illegal act because he thought the â€œgrassâ€ was illegal drugs. But he only took a substantial step toward an act that would have been a legal act, the act of buying lawn clippings. His criminal intent does not change that legal act he attempted to complete into an illegal act.</p><p>Therefore, Yang cannot be charged with an attempted purchase of illegal drugs.</p><p>[<b>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</b> This question raises the distinction between larceny from the person (pick pocket, purse snatcher) and robbery (larceny from person by fear or force.) It also raises the issues of mistake of fact. This is only a defense if it negates criminal intent. It is no defense just because the attempted crime is not feasible.</p><p>Mistake of law is also raised, and it can be very confusing. Remember this simple rule: The legality of an intended act does not alter the legality of the attempted or committed act. So focus on the act actually attempted or committed, and do not focus on the act intended.</p><p>For example, suppose jealous Boris Badanuf wants to kill Natahsa Nogudnik and takes the substantial step of driving to her house and shooting her body several times, but she has already died from a broken heart (Bullwinkle rejected her). Is it attempted murder or legal impossibility?</p><p>The answer is the crime of attempt is committed at the time of the substantial step. Always focus on that instant. If Natasha was alive at the instant Boris took that first substantial step (driving up to her home), then Boris is guilty of attempted murder at that instant. If Natasha was dead at the instant of the substantial step, she could not be killed at that moment or any time after that, so Borisâ€™ act (the substantial step) could not ever be a crime.]</p><p><b>Practice Question 16-6</b></p><p>Karen was furious because her lover Billy ran off with Mary.

KAREN</b></p><p><b>1) MURDER of Marvin?</b></p><p>Under criminal law MURDER is an unlawful homicide, the killing of one human being by another with malice aforethought. Malice for murder may be 1) express intent to kill, or implied by 2) intentionally causing great bodily injury, 3) intentionally committing an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY-MURDER RULE, or 4) intentionally acting with an awareness of and conscious disregard for unreasonable risks to human life, the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY.</p><p>The felony-murder rule applies to deaths caused by acts done during the RES GESTAE of an inherently dangerous felony, the events beginning with the first substantial step toward commission of the crime and ending when the defendants leave the scene of the crime and reach a place of relative safety.</p><p>At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) by enumerated means, or 3) caused by the commission of enumerated felonies. All other murders are in the second degree.</p><p>Here there was an unlawful homicide because Marvin was a human being and he was killed by Lucy, another human being. And it was caused by commission of an inherently dangerous felony, ROBBERY, a larceny from the person by force or fear. Karen was taking personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive because she was taking â€œdynamiteâ€ from Marvin, and she was using force or fear to overcome his will to resist because she used a â€œgunâ€. The death of Marvin occurred within the RES GESTAE of the robbery because he was shot before she left the scene of the crime.</p><p>Therefore, Karen can be charged with murder for killing Marvin during the robbery. This would typically be FIRST DEGREE MURDER because robbery is typically one of the â€œenumerated feloniesâ€ for first degree murder.</p><p><b>2) MURDER of Ruby? </b></p><p>MURDER is defined above.</p><p>There was an unlawful homicide because Ruby was a human being killed by Karen, another human being, without legal justification.</p><p>Here Karen appears to have acted with an express intent to kill because she shot Ruby in the \"head\" with a \"gun\". These facts imply an intent to kill. Alternatively, Karen clearly intended great bodily injury because the homicide was caused by a \"firearm\". Use of a firearm implies intent to cause serious bodily harm, regardless of where the victim is shot.</p><p>Karen also appears to have acted with an awareness and conscious disregard for danger to human life because she deliberately shot Ruby in the head for little good reason. Her act created extreme risks to Ruby, she apparently had an awareness of the risks and consciously disregarded them.</p><p>Based on any of the above theories, Karen could be charged with the murder of Ruby.</p><p>It appears Karen killed Ruby willfully and deliberately. If that is proven the murder was FIRST DEGREE. Karen might argue that she did not act willfully and deliberately to kill Ruby and only reacted instinctively because she had a â€œshort fuseâ€, a MITIGATING FACTOR that caused her to suffer from impaired capacity.</p><p>If Karen can convince the jury she acted instinctively and did not act willfully, deliberately and with premeditation the murder might be reduced to SECOND DEGREE.</p><p><b>3) ADEQUATE PROVOCATION for VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?</b></p><p>Under criminal law VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is an unlawful, intentional homicide without malice aforethought because of adequate provocation sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a fit of rage which could and actually did cause the homicide.</p><p>Generally â€œmere words aloneâ€ are not considered at law to be adequate provocation.</p><p>Here there was a lack of adequate provocation because \"hard looks\", being \"dissed\", challenged to a \"spelling bee\" and \"criticisms of attire\" are â€œmere words aloneâ€ that would not be sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a fit of murderous rage. The subjective factor that Karen \"had a short fuse\" would not lower the standard of conduct.</p><p>Therefore, Karen would not succeed in reducing the murder charge to voluntary manslaughter.</p><p><b>4) MURDER OF MARY? </b></p><p>Murder is defined above.</p><p>Here there was a homicide because Mary was a human being killed by Karen, another human being. And Karen had an express intent to kill because she \"decided to kill Mary\".

Karen may have had an express intent to kill because she \"knew the blast would probably kill Bill.\" But Karen would argue that she did not want to kill Bill because \"she felt real bad about it.\" Regardless, Karen deliberately created extreme risks to human life with awareness of and conscious disregard because she \"knew the blast would probably kill Bill.\"</p><p>Therefore, Karen could be charged with murder based on a Depraved Heart Theory of malice..</p><p>Further, this would generally be FIRST DEGREE murder because the use of explosives to murder is generally one of the â€œenumerated meansâ€ for first degree murder.</p><p>Therefore, Karen can probably be charged with FIRST DEGREE murder of Bill even if she did not willfully and deliberately cause his death with premeditation. She has no defenses.</p><p>[<b>ANSWER EXPLANATION:</b> This purpose of this question was to present four murders, each representing one of the four types of malice for murder. Marvin is a â€œfelony-murder ruleâ€ situation, Ruby is a â€œgreat bodily injuryâ€ case, Mary is an â€œintent to killâ€ case, and Bill is a â€œdepraved heart theoryâ€ case.</p><p>A second purpose of the question is to illustrate that â€œdepraved heart murderâ€ is not necessarily a â€œsecond degreeâ€ murder.</p><p>The question asks about â€œfirst degree\" murder, and it is an express call. The call also asks about \"lessor included offenses.\" That means manslaughter and NOT assault, battery, robbery, etc.</p><p>You must define and discuss robbery as a basis for the felony-murder rule application to some extent. A death caused by a robbery is almost always going to be first degree murder because virtually every State includes it as one of its â€œenumerated feloniesâ€.</p><p>Only one murder here presents any evidence of \"provocation\" or â€œmitigating factorsâ€.]</p>', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2017-10-21 02:36:56', 1);

A breach is MINOR if the breaching party\r\nhas SUBSTANTIALLY PERFORMED (which see). A minor breach entitles the non-\r\nbreaching party to compensation in the form of an OFFSET FOR DAMAGES suffered, but it\r\ndoes not excuse the non-breaching party from performance or accelerate performance by the\r\nbreaching party.
