Bill claims he phoned Sara and offered to buy a 1939 Denny Wilson card for $550, and that Sara accepted.\r\nImmediately after their phone conversation, Bill sent Sara an unsigned, typed letter confirming the contract, and identifying the parties, the Denny Wilson card and the price. Billâ€™s letter had a letterhead identifying the name of his business, Beyerâ€™s Baseball Cards and Collectibles.

To avoid the possibility of losing her employees, who might quit if forced to take a two-week layoff, Painter took another job, which was not completed until June 20, at which time Painter started work on Developerâ€™s building.\r\nOn July 15, Painter informed Developer that she would not be able to complete the project until August 15. Developer told her he would lose substantial rental income if the project was not completed by August 1, when university students, his prime market, began moving in. He asked her to hire additional help, but she refused, saying the job would be finished on August 15 or not at all. In an attempt to get the job completed sooner, Developer fired Painter and looked for another painting contractor.\r\nThe best price Developer could get to have another painting contractor finish the job was $30,000. Before firing Painter, Developer had paid Painter one-half of the contract price. Because the painting was completed late, Developer lost $10,000 in rental income. This rental income would not have been lost if the painting had been completed by August 1.\r\nAt the time Painter was fired, she was out-of-pocket for $5,000 in materials.

To ensure timely deliveries, Jack included a liquidated damages clause which provided that Stone-Co would pay $5,000 per day for each day that any requested delivery is late.\r\nJack signed and dropped off the contract to Stone-Co for its review and signature. That evening, the Stone-Co salesperson, knowing that Austin Brown Stone is often not easily obtained, wrote the following just below Jackâ€™s liquidated damages clause: â€œNotwithstanding the foregoing, if Stone-Co has difficulty getting Austin Brown Stone, Stone-Co may substitute Austin White Stone.â€\r\nThe Stone-Co salesperson then signed the contract and returned it to Jack the next day. Jack did not read the modified contract or see the term added by Stone-Co.\r\nOne week later, Jack made a request for the first 5 tons of Austin Brown Stone, and Stone-Co started looking for a supplier. Stone-Co quickly discovered that Austin Brown Stone was not available in the United States. Although it could be imported from Canada, importing it would add $25 per ton to Stone-Coâ€™s expenses and reduce its profit margin.\r\nTen days after Jackâ€™s order, Stone-Co delivered Austin White Stone with a note stating that Austin Brown Stone was not available in the U.S., and a demand for payment at the new price of $225 per ton. Jack immediately called the Stone-Co salesperson, stating he would not accept the substitution because Austin White Stone is a completely different product.\r\nJack contracted with another supplier for Austin Brown Stone at $225 per ton. Jack thereafter filed a lawsuit against Stone-Co seeking damages for breach of contract and liquidated damages.\r\n1.

Under this contract, Ellen was to do the electrical work for the building for $15,000. At the time she entered into the contract, Ellen was not aware of Billâ€™s on-time bonus, but learned about it before she was to begin the job.\r\nIn the midst of the job, after receiving $3,000 in progress payments, Ellen decided she could not profitably do the electrical work for $15,000 and quit. Bill looked diligently for an electrical contractor to complete the work at the lowest cost. The only electrical contractor Bill could locate was Roger. Roger demanded $20,000 to complete the work. Bill agreed and paid Roger $20,000 upon completion.\r\nIn spite of Billâ€™s best efforts, and solely because Ellen had quit the job, Bill completed construction late and, as a result, did not receive the on-time bonus.\r\n1.

The primary advantage of\r\nthe new razor is that it totally eliminates the possibility of the customer being cut in the\r\nprocess of getting a shave.\r\nIn general, barbers prefer the tradition of using the straight razor to the electric razor\r\nbecause it allows them to better show off their skills as a barber. Although not all agree,\r\nsome believe that the straight razor gives a closer shave. The new razors have,\r\nhowever, been scientifically established to provide just as close a shave as the straight\r\nrazor.\r\nBarry continues to shave men as he always has because he enjoys the use of the\r\nblade, and because the electric razor is expensive. He is also concerned about the\r\nreliability of these new devices under the heavy use they would receive in a barbershop.\r\nMoe comes into Barryâ€™s shop to get a shave. Halfway through the shave, Moe suddenly\r\njumps up from the chair, cheering because he checked his smartphone and saw his\r\nfavorite baseball team score a run.

For the defendant to be found guilty of manslaughter, a proximate cause between the illegal act and the resulting death of the victim must exist. This causation must be more than simple cause-in-fact; it must be somehow foreseeable from the illegal action taken. In this case, the fact the defendant did not possess a valid license was not a causal factor in the death of the child.\r\n\r\n Answer A is incorrect. The common law misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, while permitting the prosecution of involuntary manslaughter for misdemeanor offenses, still requires that there be a proximate cause between the illegal action and death. Answer B is incorrect. While the licensing requirements may be to protect life, criminal liability for manslaughter requires more than simple negligence, but also proximate cause. Finally, answer D is incorrect; manslaughter does not require that the defendant have any criminal intent to commit an offense. Recklessness is sufficient.

The businessman\'s claim of self-defense will fail because his belief that he was acting in self-defense was not reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because, to successfully raise a self-defense claim, the businessman must not only believe that he faced an imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, but also that belief must be reasonable. The businessman\'s apprehension of danger was unreasonable on its face, so he cannot make a proper self-defense claim. Answer B is incorrect because the businessman did not need to appreciate the risk he was creating to be found guilty of manslaughter. In addition, his voluntary intoxication was one of the reasons for his recklessness and will not serve as a defense. Answer C is incorrect because a proper claim of self-defense does not require that the person actually be in danger, but rather that the person reasonably believe he is in danger, even if it is not true.

The employee then left town.  At 5 a.m. Monday, the employee, after driving all night, was overcome with remorse and had a change of heart.  He called the security officer on duty at the company and told him about the bomb.  The security officer said he would take care of the matter.

Although the employee did not intend to kill the company vice president in particular, he is guilty of first degree murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, although at the precise moment the company vice president was killed, the employee did not have the intent to kill anyone, when he took the actions that led to the vice president\'s death, he did have the intent to kill.  The employee cannot escape liability for murder merely because he changed his mind after he set the murder in motion.

It was completely foreseeable that someone other than the boss would be killed as a result of the employee\'s actions, and the security guard\'s failure to stop the company vice president will not negate the employee\'s guilt.

Although the defendant quickly changed her mind, she still moved and concealed the property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it and thus committed the offense of larceny.

Common law murder is not a specific intent crime. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied by actions that show a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. In this case, the woman\'s act of firing an automatic weapon in a populated bank demonstrates the reckless indifference necessary to show malice aforethought, and the woman can be convicted of murder. The woman was acting with gross recklessness toward human life and thus with malice aforethought. The man is the woman\'s accomplice: a person who aids or encourages another to commit the illegal conduct. He is liable for the principal crime so long as he intended that the crime be committed. Not only is he liable for the principal crime, but also all other foreseeable crimes that occur. In this case, it was foreseeable that entering into a bank to rob it with loaded guns could result in firing those guns and killing someone. Therefore the man can also be convicted of murder under accomplice liability.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect because the man, as the woman\'s accomplice, is criminally liable for the woman\'s actions, and can be convicted of murder.  Answer B is incorrect because even unintentional homicides can be the basis for murder if they are done with malice aforethought.  In this case, the gross recklessness toward human life shown by the woman and the man\'s actions is sufficient for a finding of malice aforethought.

The textile company did not inform the mechanic of its contract with the customer, and thus the mechanic had no reason to know what impact his failure to timely perform would have on the textile company\'s relationship with its customer.

The facts are insufficient to support this conclusion since the textile company had contracted with the mechanic for repairs to be completed within a time frame that would have allowed the textile company to timely fulfill its contractual obligations to the customer.\r\n\r\nAnswer D is incorrect.

The woman opened the bathroom window, saw the jewelry box on the counter, and started to climb inside. As her leg cleared the window sill, the neighbor\'s dog began to bark loudly. Terrified, the woman jumped back outside and fled.\r\n\r\nThe crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious crime, if any, committed by the woman?','Answer A is correct. The woman is guilty of burglary because she unlawfully entered the neighbor\'s house at night with intent to commit a felony (larceny). The woman\'s actions constituted the requisite entry of the neighbor\'s house. To constitute burglary, it is sufficient if any part of the actor\'s person intruded, even momentarily, into the structure. Thus it has been held that the intrusion of a part of a hand in opening a window, or the momentary intrusion of part of a foot clearing the window sill, constituted the requisite entry.

The woman may have been guilty of attempted larceny, but that crime arguably would merge into, and in any event was less serious than, the crime of burglary.

At common law, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony therein.

There is also no evidence that the pickpocket entered the party with the intent to commit a felony or a theft.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect because the neighbor did not commit a burglary and is not criminally responsible for the pickpocket\'s actions, because he did not have the intent that the larceny occur, and he did not knowingly aid and abet the pickpocket in the commission of the crime.

Under rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked \"payment in full.\" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt.

Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim.

Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of \"[the customer] and his family,\" the customer\'s availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer\'s duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer\'s delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer\'s recovery, his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct (informing the photographer to \"take the photograph anyway\") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline.

For the mother to be an intended beneficiary, she must be the person to whom performance is to be given.

The instructor has filed a motion for summary judgment based on the waiver. \r\n\r\nWhat is the woman\'s best argument in opposition to the instructor\'s motion?\r\n','A is incorrect. Bowling is not inherently dangerous; virtually no one is seriously injured while bowling. Even if bowling were inherently dangerous, that characterization would support an argument for permitting recreational participants who appreciate the risks of the activity to assume the risks by signing a waiver rather than constituting a reason for ignoring the waiver. \r\n\r\nB is correct. Waivers are most easily justified when an activity poses inherent risks that are familiar to the participants and cannot be entirely eliminated without removing the pleasure from the activity. The risk that materialized here is not inherent to bowling but could arise whenever someone is careless while holding a heavy object. A court might find that it is against public policy to permit individuals or businesses to insulate themselves from the deterrent incentives provided by the threat of negligence liability. For that reason, the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and could hold the waiver ineffective. \r\n\r\nC is incorrect. Although the court might find that the waiver did not present the woman with a fair choice and therefore hold the waiver to be no bar when the harm was due to the instructor\'s negligence, asking the woman to sign the waiver was not in itself negligent or unreasonable. For example, the waiver might have barred recovery against the instructor if the woman were injured by the negligence of another class participant, or the court might have decided that the waiver was not inconsistent with public policy given the recreational nature of the activity. \r\n\r\nD is incorrect.

The crime of false pretenses, like other theft crimes, requires the intent to steal.

This fact does not excuse the woman for knowingly making false statements to obtain property that she would not otherwise have been able to obtain. The reason the woman cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses is that she lacked the requisite intent to steal; she made the false statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her. \r\n\r\nC is incorrect.

The nephew, hoping to collect his inheritance, intentionally caused the death of the man, and should be found guilty of criminal homicide. The issue in this question is what actions are sufficient to be considered as \"causing\" the death of another.

The fact that a victim may have died in another manner if the defendant\'s actions were not taken is not a defense to a homicide charge. The nephew\'s poisoning did shorten the man\'s life, and the fact that it was possible that the man could have died in another manner does not serve as a defense to the charge. Answer C is incorrect. The nephew\'s poisoning shortened the man\'s life, and the fact that the man may have died from a fatal illness, while it shows the nephew isn\'t so smart, does not serve as a defense to the charge of murder.

She had lied about there having been a man with a rifle and had acted alone.\r\n\r\nOf what crime or crimes can the woman be convicted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Answer D is correct. All the elements of larceny and robbery were present. Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of his interest in the property. Robbery is the taking of personal property of another from the other\'s person by force or intimidation with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. The woman\'s threat of immediate harm to the clerk was sufficient to constitute the intimidation required for robbery. However, because larceny is a lesser included offense of robbery, she cannot be convicted of both offenses for a single incident.\r\n\r\nAnswer A is incorrect. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of property of another by a person in lawful possession of that property. The woman never had lawful possession of the money and so cannot be convicted of embezzlement.\r\n\r\nAnswer B is incorrect. Theft by false pretenses occurs when a person obtains title to the property of another by an intentional or knowing false statement of past or existing fact with the intent to defraud the other. This is larceny because the money was taken by trespass, i.e., without consent and by force or threat of force. Because they money was taken by a trespass, and not with the consent of the victim, the woman cannot have valid title, she only has possession. The crime was not false pretenses because, among other things, the woman never obtained title to the cash.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect. It is true that all the elements of larceny and robbery (which may be thought of as aggravated larceny) were present, as explained above. However, because robbery and larceny are greater and lesser included offenses, a defendant cannot be convicted of both for a single offense.','2017-09-09 05:48:59',1,'[\"A.\\tEmbezzlement.\",\"B.\\tObtaining property by false pretenses.\",\"C.\\tRobbery and larceny.\",\"D.\\tRobbery or larceny.\"]',3,'General Principles'),(83,1,19,'A young woman joined a neighborhood gang.

Answer D is incorrect because the young woman intentionally, and with premeditation, killed the rival gang member, and is thus guilty of first degree murder and not second degree murder.

Robbery is defined at common law as the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Burglary is the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein. Felony murder is the killing of a human being in the course of a violent felony. In this case, the defendant is guilty of burglary, robbery, and murder. The defendant forced, at weapon point, the couple to allow him to enter their dwelling, which is sufficient for breaking and entering. When this breaking and entering occurred, the defendant had the intent to commit a theft of their property, and he is guilty of burglary. In addition, the defendant used force by tying and binding the couple, and the threat of force by threatening them, to take the necklace from the couple, and he had the intent to permanently deprive them of the necklace.

The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender\'s best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor\'s age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law.

Answer B is incorrect because ignorance of the law is generally not an excuse, and the bartender\'s not being told that he has to check identification does not affect the offense\'s mens rea requirement. When a crime requires that the defendant act knowingly, he must have been aware that his conduct was of a particular nature, or at least know that his conduct will necessarily or very likely cause a particular result. Here, he must have been aware of the fact that he was selling to a minor, or to someone between the ages of 18 and 21, not the fact that his conduct was violating that regulation.\r\n\r\nAnswer C is incorrect because, again, ignorance of the law is no excuse, and not knowing that beer is an alcoholic beverage does not excuse the bartender\'s actions.

The courts are split regarding whether a defendant is liable for felony murder when the death is caused by a third party. Under the proximate cause theory, a defendant can be liable where the innocent party is killed as the result of resistance from the victim or police.

Its plant emits a mist of extremely small particles that drift across the valley and settle on the jalapenÌƒos at Juanâ€™s pepper farm, causing them to be discolored and unsellable.\r\n\r\nWhat is Juanâ€™s best cause of action against Gonsanto?',' (A) Answer (A) is correct because Gonsanto is emitting â€œa mist of particlesâ€ that is landing on Juanâ€™s land. (B), (C) and (D) are all inferior causes of action because they require Juan to prove Gonsantoâ€™s action is â€œunreasonableâ€. That might be very difficult. But since he can prove Gonsanto is actually causing â€œvisible matterâ€ to land on his property, no matter how â€œextremely smallâ€ it is, he avoids having to prove that it is â€œunreasonableâ€.

(D) is wrong because â€œintent to cause harmâ€ is not a required legal element.
