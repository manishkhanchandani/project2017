Question 1

On Mayl, Buyer received the following letter:
Dear Buyer: I have decided to give up my ranch and move to town. I thought that you might consider buying it from me. I will sell it to you for its current market value, $80,000. Call me by May 10. I will keep this proposal open, and will not withdraw it, until after that date.
/s/ Seller
The next day, Buyer mentioned to a friend, Mary, that he was considering buying the ranch.

Grading Sheet
1. An offer is an manifestation of present intention and willingness to enter into a bargain and be bound.
2. Seller's letter is an offer under reasonable person standard.

6. Acceptance made as invited is operative.
7. Offer stated that Buyer must telephone Seller by May 10. Therefore, placing the letter in the mail was not effective acceptance.
8. A direct reovcation is a manifestation of intention by the Seller not to enter the contract. It is effective on receipt.

Question 2
Beginning on September 1, and continuing through October 31, the Daily News published the following announcement each day in its newspaper:
Attention Word Builders!
In honor of its fiftieth anniversary, the Daily News is sponsoring a contest. Whoever finds the most words using the letters in the phrase HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAILY NEWS, and delivers the word list to us by November 1, will receive $2000! The word list should include only words that appear in the Standard English Dictionary, 2nd Edition. No proper nouns, foreign words, or contractions. Good luck! 
On October 1, the Daily News received a word list from Alice Adams. Attached to the word list was a note in which Adams wrote that she had included proper nouns and foreign words because sometimes judges did not follow the rules and she wanted to have the longest list.
On October 10, Barbara Burns delivered her word list to the Daily News. Her list conformed to the published rules.
On October 20, Cathy Cook called the News and asked what would happen if two or more contestants tied for the longest word list. The receptionist checked with the publisher and then told Cook that, in that case, the winners would split the $2000. Cook then compiled her list, which conformed to the rules, and delivered it to the Daily News. 
On November 1, the Daily News announced that Burns and Cook had tied for first place and that each wouldbe awarded $1000. Adams read the announcement, reviewed the winning lists, and discovered that, even without the improper words, her list had every word that appeared on the winning lists plus ten adhtional words. When she called the newspaper to complain, she was told that she had been disqualified from the contest because of her note and the paper had not counted the words in her list.
QUESTION:
Your law firm represents the Daily News. Adams, Burns, and Cook each claim to be entitled to $2000 under the rules of the contest. Please advise your client regardmg each claim.

Grading Sheet
1. Identify the elements of the contract (offer, acceptance and consideration)
2. Recognize that this advertisement is an offer.
3. Recognize unilateral contract: i.e. the offer could be accepted by performance of its terms.
4. In a unilateral contract, performance as requested constitutes the consideration.
Adams
5. Because she deviated from the published rules, Adams did not accepted the offer.
Burns
6. By delivering conforming word lists to the Daily News by November 1, Burns/Cook accepted the offer.
7. Identify issue as to whether the Daily News explained this offer or changed the terms of its offer when it said that $2000 would be split among tying winners.
8. Contract will be enforced according to reasonable interpretation of its terms.
9. Where both parties interpretations are reasonable, contract will be interpreted against the drafter.
10. If the written offer is interpreted to mean that each winner is entitled to $2000, then Burns had fully performed before Daily News clarified the terms of her and thus can enforce the original contract.
Cook
11. Because the offer to Cook was not accepted until she was notified of the change, she accepted the change term by compiling and delivering her entry.



Question 3

On March 5, Vendor, who owned a piece of real estate called Nutacre, telephoned Byers : "Nutacre is for sale. I'll let you have it for $100,000 in cash. Although I've talked to other prospective buyers, I assure you that I won't sell it to anyone else before April 1. I'll hold the offer open exclusively for you until that time. Closing will be on April 15."
On March 6, Byers, who was familiar with Nutacre, went to see Vendor. He told Vendor, "I need to look at some other property before I can decide. It will be the last week in March before I can get back to you. Here is $50 to keep your offer open until April 1."
Vendor replied, during the same conversation, "Thank you for the $50. I will definitely keep the offer open until April 1." On March 21, Vendor sold Nutacre to Smith.
On March 22, Byers first learned of the sale to Smith when he read about it in the local paper.
On March 23, Byers hand delivered to Vendor a letter that read, "You gave me your word you would keep the offer open until April 1. I hereby accept your offer to sell Nutacre to me for $100,000 in cash. I will give you the cash on April 15. [Signed] Byers."
On March 25, Vendor responded in a letter to Byers that he had already sold the land to Smith.
On April 15, Byers tendered $100,000 in cash to Vendor, but Vendor refused to accept it.
Question
Discuss whether Byers has an enforceable contract with Vendor for the sale of Nutacre. Be sure to discuss whether Vendor's promises to keep his offer open are enforceable.

Grading Sheet
1. Vendor's March 5 phone call was an offer to sell Nutacre to Buyer.
2. An offer is an manifestation to enter into a bargain, made to invite another to accept the invitation.
	2a. An offer must contain all relevant terms such as: what is to be sold, for how much, and by when.
3. An offer is not revoked until the offeror has communicated its revocation to the offeree. In other words, revocation occurs when the offeror takes action inconsistent with the offer and the offeree acquires reliable information to that effect.
4. Thus, mere selling of Nutacre to Smith did not operate as revocation because Byers did not know about the sale.
5. However, Byers reading about the sale on March 22 was a revocation which did terminate the offer.
6. The offer could not be revoked if Vendor's assurance not to sell created an option contract.
7. Recognition of statute of frauds issue.
8. An option contract for the sale of real estate is created if it satisfies requirements which include:
	8a. that the promise to keep the offer open must be in writing and signed, and
	8b. that it must be supported by consideration.
9. The problem here is that the contract option was not signed by Vendor. 


Question 4

Homeowner decided have a sprinkler system installed in his yard. He looked in the phone book for someone to do the work. Homeowner found an advertisement by Landscaper that read:
Will install sprinkler systems. You buy the parts and we install them for you. Any residential lot under 1,000 square feet, less than $1,000, guaranteed!
Homeowner thought Landscaper's price was good, so the next morning he faxed her the following note:
I am thinking about installing a sprinkler system in my yard. I haven't decided what to do yet. The yard is 500 square feet. How much would it cost to have you do the work? If I buy the parts myself, can you install them for $500? If you can do it for $500, let's do it within the next two weeks.
That same day, Landscaper sent Homeowner the following fax:
Thank you for your interest. We look forward to installing your sprinkler system. Unfortunately, $500 will not cover our costs. We have a minimum charge of $750. We'll plan on showing up in two weeks to do the work for $750 unless I hear from you before then. Please have the parts ready for us.
Two weeks later, Landscaper showed up at Homeowner's house. She knocked on the door, but no one answered. She saw the sprinkler parts sitting by the garage and installed them. At the end of the day, just as Landscaper was getting in her truck to drive off, Homeowner hve up and asked Landscaper what she was doing. After Landscaper explained, Homeowner told her that he had hired someone else to do the work for $500. Homeowner said he was not going to pay Landscaper a penny, much less the $750 that Landscaper wanted.
QUESTION:

Grading Sheet
1. In order to be an offer, a statement must contain terms that are reasonably certain.

7. Landscaper may claim that Homeowner's fax invited acceptance by performance within the two week period.
	7a. If so, the amount of the claim would be $500, the amount offered by Homeowner.
8. If Landscaper cannot prove either contract claim, she may still argue that she is entitled to some recovery on a quisi-contract theory (also called "quantum merit", "unjust enrichment", or even "quantum velebant").
	8a. Under any of these, Landscaper's remedy is the reasonable value of his services.
	
	
Question 5

Father's adult child, Son, was seriously injured in a car accident. Doctor, a licensed physician, who happened by the scene of the accident, found Son unconscious, treated him at the scene, and took him to his hospital. A few days later Father came to the hospital and told Doctor, "If you continue treating Son, I'll pay all of your fees, those for the services you have already rendered and those you will deliver to Son in the future. " Doctor thanked Father and continued to treat Son until he died two days later, never having regained consciousness.

	7a. Father need not have benefitted from Doctor's services; the consideration may move from the promisee to a third person.
	7b. Courts are not concerned about the adequacy of the consideration.
8. A promise to answer the debt of another is within the Statute of Frauds and must be in writing.
9. Here, father's promise is an original promise, not a promise to answer for the son's debt, therefore it does not fall within the Statue of Frauds.
10. The Doctor may assert that the Father is estopped from denying the existence of the contract because he reasonably relied upon the Father's statemetns.

Question 9

Widow acquired title to Greenacre through her late husband's will. When Widow applied to Bank for a loan to be secured by a mortgage on Greenacre, Bank replied, "Because it is possible that husband's child by his first marriage, Son, has an interest in Greenacre we will give you the loan only if you obtain Son's quitclaim deed to the property before May 1st." Widow then wrote to Son telling him what Bank had said and added, "Although I know that you have no interest in Greenacre, I will pay you $800 if you agree to deliver to me a quitclaim deed to the property before May 1st." Widow had intended to offer Son $500, but mistakenly had typed $800 in the letter. Son had no reason to know that Widow intended the amount to be $500.
Son, who knew that he had no interest in Greenacre, immediately replied, "I want to talk it over with my lawyer before I accept. If you don't hear from me before April 25th, however, you may assume that I have agreed to your offer." Widow replied, "O.K."

4. If a non-mistaken party (son) has no reason to know of the mistake by the other party (Widow), Widow cannot take advantage of the mistake to void the agreement.
5. Son's letter was not an acceptance because he did not manifest his acceptance in the manner set forth in the offer.
6. Ordinarily an offer cannot be accepted by silence.
7. Because Widow agreed in his second letter, Son's silence through April 25th operated as an acceptance.
8. A revocation is not effective until it has been communicated to and and received by the offeree.

Finder came upon an illegal dog fight and rescued one of the dogs. Finder took the dog to a veterinarian for necessary treatment, and then, believing the dog to be a stray, took him home to keep him as a family pet. The veterinarian's bill, which Finder paid, was $100. Finder also spent $25 for food for the dog.
A few days later, Owner saw the dog in Finder's yard. Owner explained to Finder that the dog was his beloved Fluffy and demanded that Finder return Fluffy to him. Finder could tell that Fluffy was Owner's dog by Fluffy's reaction to seeing Owner. He felt that returning Fluffy to Owner was the right thing to do, so he agreed.
The next day Finder learned about the reward and demanded that Owner pay him $1,125; $1,000 as payment for the advertised reward and $125 as reimbursement for the cost of the dog food and the veterinarian's bill. Owner responded, "I don't owe you anything, but because you took care of Fluffy, I will pay you $500 if you are willing to wait until the first of the month." Finder agreed.

13. Finder, however, rendered the services voluntarily, therefore the subsequent promise to pay is not enforceable.
14. Promise to pay $500 could be construed as an offer to compromise a disputed claim. (Consideration is surrender of Finder's claim).

Question 12
Bill Buyer and Susana Seller are both citizens of the State of Fiction, a jurisdiction which follows majority position common law. On a number of prior occasions, Buyer and Seller have had casual conversations regarding Buyer’s interest in purchasing Blackacre, a piece of real estate owned by Seller and located in Fiction. Recently, Buyer called Seller and asked Seller if she would be willing to meet later that evening and discuss the purchase of Blackacre. Seller initially declined, indicating that she was sick and on medication. After some additional coaxing from Buyer, Seller agreed.
Later that evening, Buyer and Seller met at a local pub. Seller initially did not drink because she was not supposed to consume alcohol with her medication. As the evening progressed, Seller began drinking and ultimately consumed several beers. After a couple of hours, Buyer turned the discussion toward the potential purchase of Blackacre. Buyer asked Seller, “How much is it going to cost for me to buy Blackacre from you?” Seller, who had a glazed look on her face, asked Buyer to repeat the question. Buyer did so. Seller leaned back, gazed up at the ceiling, and told Buyer that she would sell Blackacre for $10,000. Buyer was shocked and excited because he believed the property to be worth at least $50,000. Buyer stuck out his hand to shake on the deal and exclaimed “you’ve got a deal.” Buyer took out a pen and wrote on the back of a cocktail napkin that Seller had agreed to sell Blackacre to Buyer for a total purchase price of $10,000. Buyer dated the napkin and showed it to Seller. Seller nodded her head in apparent agreement that the terms on the napkin accurately reflected the terms for the sale of Blackacre. Buyer offered Seller $100 as a down payment toward the property. Seller accepted the $100, then the two shook hands again and left the bar.
The next morning Buyer called Seller to discuss a date to complete the transaction which they had negotiated the night before. Seller told Buyer that she did not know what Buyer was talking about; she did not recall any of the events from the preceding night; and she had no intention of selling Blackacre for $10,000.

8. Partial payment of a contract for the sale of real estate does not constitute partial performance alone - possession or valuable improvements are also required.

Question 13

Seller and Buyer had been negotiating the sale of property located at 200 N. Main Street in Smallville. On March 1, Seller sent the following letter to Buyer:
I will sell you the 200 N. Main Street property for $100,000 cash, the deed to be delivered and the cash paid on June 1. If I do not hear from you by March 30, I will assume that you have accepted this offer. I would not sell this property for this price to anyone but you.
(signed) Seller
Buyer received the letter while he was ill and in bed. He showed the letter to his son and told him that he intended to accept Seller’s offer. Buyer died on March 25 without replying to Seller’s offer.
On April 5, Seller learned that Buyer had died. Seller made no attempt to confer with anyone representing the Buyer about the property.
On June 1, the executor of Buyer’s estate tendered $100,000 to Seller for 200 N. Main. (Assume that Buyer’s executor was the proper party to purchase the property if there was a contract for its sale.) Seller refused to accept the money or to execute and deliver a deed to the property.

7. Therefore, there was no contract for the sale of the property.

Question 14
Father wrote to his adult Son, “I want you to have my property Twelve Oaks as a wedding present, but I would need $50,000 from you to pay off the mortgage on the property.” Son replied in writing, “I will pay you $50,000 for Twelve Oaks on March 1, provided I can get a loan from the bank before that date.” Father replied by mail, “It's a deal.” Both Father and Son knew that Twelve Oaks was reasonably worth $100,000.
Although he tried, Son could not obtain a loan from the bank. Instead, his mother-in-law lent him $50,000. Son then paid the $50,000 to Father on March 2 and explained that he was out-of-town on business on March 1, and returned too late to make payment on that date.
Father accepted the money and discharged the mortgage. Later, however, having learned that Son obtained the $50,000 from his mother-in-law and not from the bank, Father changed his mind about the wedding present and the sale and refused to deed Twelve Oaks to Son. Father gave as his reasons: (1) that there was no consideration to support the deal; (2) that the condition of obtaining a loan from the bank had not occurred; and (3) that Son was late in paying the $50,000.
QUESTION:
Discuss the validity of Father’s reasons for not delivering the deed to Twelve Oaks to Son.

Grading Sheet
1. A valid contract between father and son exists, as all of the elements are present.
	1a. Offer
	1b. Acceptance
	1c. Consideration
2. Since this is a contract involving land, it must be writing to comply with the Statute of Frauds.
3. Son has given valid consideration for the contract by his promise to pay $50,000.
4. The adequacy of consideration to Father is not a concern under the law, only the existence of consideration.
5. The obligation of obtaining loan from the Bank is not a condition of Father's duty to deliver the Deed.
6. Unless the contract is clear that the date of payment is essential to protect the parties, late payment does not excuse performance.
7. Father cannot refuse to deliver the Deed because payment is late; he can only recover for damages he can prove by the delay.
8. Father closed on the contract and waived any condition that payment must be made by March 1 when he accepted payment on March 2.
