<p>Under contract law an <strong>unconscionable contract will not be enforceable</strong> because there is <strong>NO REASONABLE FINDING OF INTENT</strong> to enter into such a contract. An <strong>ADHESION CONTRACT </strong>is a <strong>"take it or leave it" </strong>contract that a party is forced to agree to, and it will often be found unenforceable.</p>
