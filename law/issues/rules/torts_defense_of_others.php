<p>Under tort law a person is privileged to act <strong>reasonably</strong> as necessary to <strong>defend others</strong> who are <strong>NOT AGGRESSORS</strong> from harm.    </p>
<p>Aggressors are people who have <strong>unreasonably created</strong> or increased <strong>dangers</strong> to others.    </p>
<p>Courts are split when a defendant<strong> unknowingly acts</strong> to defend an <strong>AGGRESSOR</strong>.
    
    Under one view the defendant <strong>STEPS INTO THE SHOES</strong> of the aggressor and has <strong>no privilege</strong> because the aggressor could<strong> not claim</strong> self-defense.
    
    In other Courts the defendant is <strong>privileged</strong> to defend the aggressor  if they act with a <strong>REASONABLE BELIEF</strong> they are acting to <strong>defend an innocent</strong> victim of aggression.</p>
