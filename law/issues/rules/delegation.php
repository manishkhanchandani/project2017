<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>A delegation is <strong>transfer of a contractual duty</strong> to a third party.</p>
<p>

Parties promising to perform contract duties are promisors as to those duties. When promisors arrange for other parties to perform contract duties for them, it is a "delegation". Promisors that delegate contract duties are "promisor / delegators" and parties delegated those duties are "delegatees". These are called "delegates" and "delegants". The term mean the same thing.</p>
<p>

The classic "delegation" situation is a general contractor delegating tasks to "sub-contractors".</p>
<p>

So we have promisor/delegator and delegatee.</p>
<p>

A. Non Delegable Duties</p>
<p>

Duties cannot be delegated if</p>
<p>

1. The contract expressly prohibits delegation, OR</p>
<p>

2. Delegation would materially change the benefits the promisee would receive.</p>
<p>

Delegation is never valid if it involves personal services of the promisor that could not be performed by an agent or employee of the promisor.</p>
<p>

Example, Well known singer cannot delegate to another singer, because we want to see that singer.
</p>
<p>
B. Promisor / Delegator Remains Bound</p>
<p>

A promisor / delegator cannot escape liability for master contract duties by delegating the contract.</p>
<p>

C. When Delegation is "Effective"</p>
<p>

The delegation is effect if </p>
<p>

1. The promisor/delegator clearly manifests a present intent to delegate the duties;</p>
<p>

2. The duties to be performed currently exist, AND</p>
<p>

3. The delegatee agrees to assume the duties of the promisor.</p>
<p>

D. Gratuitous and Contractual Delegations</p>
<p>

Contract duties may be assumed by delegatees as gratuitous gestures or for consideration.</p>
<p>

1. Gratuitous Delegations</p>
<p>

When contract duties are assumed by delegatees as gratuitous gestures they are "gratuitous delegations" and the delegatees are "gratuitous delegatees" or perhaps "donor delegatees".</p>
<p>

Gratuituous delegations are merely "gift promises" by the delegatees and no contractual relationship is created between the promisor / delegator and the gratuitous delegatee.</p>
<p>

2. Contractual Delegations</p>
<p>

When delegatee assume contract duties in exchange for consideration they are "contractual delegations", and the delegatees are "contractual delegatees" or perhaps "debtor delegatees".</p>
<p>

Contractual Delegations bind the promisor/delegator and contractual delegatee to a contractual agreement. For clarity this might be called the "delegation contract" to distinguish it from the "master contract" that created the duties being delegated.</p>
<p>

Delegation contracts are always third-party beneficiary contracts because they are always formed between the promisors/delegators and contractual delegatee knowing the purpose of the contract is to benefit the promisee of the master contract.</p>
<p>

The intended third party beneficiary of a delegation contract (the promisee of the master contract) has standing to enforce it against both the promisor/delegator and the contractual delegatee.</p>
<p>

E. Revocation of Gratuitous Delegation</p>
<p>

Contractual delegation cannot be revoked if the promisor / delegator and delegatee are bound by the delegation contract, but if the delegation contract fails or is rescinded the delegation can be revoked by either one of them.</p>
<p>

Gratuitous contract delegations are revocable by both gratuitous delegatees and promisor / delegators. Revocation is effective upon notice from one to the another.</p>
<p>

If any parties have relied on a gratuitous delegation, they may be able to estop revocation in equity based on claim of promissory estoppel.</p>
<p>

F. Gratuitous Delegatee Not Liable</p>
<p>

A gratuitous delegatee has only made a gift promise to assume the duties of the promisor, and is never legally liable to either promisor / delegator or the promisee.</p>
<p>

G. Contractual Delegatee Liabile to Both Delegator and Promisee</p>
<p>

Contractual Delegatees are legally liable to both the promisor / delegator and the promisee of the master contract under the terms of the delegation contract.
</p>
<p>
H. Promisees Not Liable to Delegatees</p>
<p>

Under common law, promisees are not liable to delegatees. They are only liable to promisors.</p>
<p>

I. Promisees Remain Bound</p>
<p>

Promisees remain liable to promisors under the master contract.</p>
<p>

J. Promisors / Delegators Liable to Contractual Delegatees</p>
<p>

Promisors / delegators are legally liable to contractual delegatees under the terms of the delegation contract. If contractual delegatees perform as promised, promisor / delegator are liable to them under the terms of the delegation contract.</p>
<p>

K. Defenses of Promisors and Promisees remain Unchanged</p>
<p>

The defenses of both promisees and promisors are unchanged by delegation.</p>
<p>













Under contract law the duty to perform under a contract may be DELEGATED to a DELEGATEE by an original promisor/delegator. However, the promisor/delegator remains primarily liable to the original promisee for performance of the contract. The delegation becomes EFFECTIVE when the delegatee agrees to perform the duties of the promisor/delegator.</p>
<p>



If the delegatee accepts the delegation in exchange for CONSIDERATION, a legal contract is created between the promisor/delegator and the delegatee, and the original promisee is an intended third-party beneficiary of that contract. As an intended third-party beneficiary the promisee has standing to pursue legal actions against both the promisor/delegator and the delegatee.</p>
<p>



If the delegatee GRATUITOUSLY accepts the delegation the delegatee has no legal liability to the original promisee and the promisee can only enforce the delegation agreement in equity by showing detrimental reliance.</p>
