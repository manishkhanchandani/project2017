<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under UCC <strong>2-205</strong> an <strong>offer by a merchant </strong>that promises to "<strong>leave the offer open</strong>" for a <strong>period of time</strong> cannot be revoked by the offeror if it is <strong>stated in writing</strong>, for the period of time stated, or for a <strong>reasonable period</strong> of time (given the circumstances) if no time period is stated. However, regardless of the period of time stated by the offeror, the <strong>offeror can revoke within 3 months</strong> if that is less than the time period stated. If the merchant promises to "leave the offer open" for any period of time, whether more or less than 3 months, that is the "reasonable period of time" in which the <strong>offeree can accept the offer even if the offeror could legally revoke </strong>the offer sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Example 1 (Did Homer have a valid OPTION?)</strong></p>
<p>Offer is defined above. Under common law an <strong>OPTION</strong> is a contractual agreement that an <strong>offeror will not revoke an offer</strong> for a <strong>specific period of time</strong> in exchange for <strong>CONSIDERATION</strong> from the offeree. CONSIDERATION is an exchange of promises posing legal detriment such that the law deems it sufficient to support an agreement.</p>
<p>

Here Lucy promised to give a <strong>&quot;firm offer</strong><strong>&quot;</strong>, but Homer gave no promise or value in exchange. While the UCC provides for &quot;firm offers&quot; from merchants, the UCC does not govern here. Therefore, Lucy received no legal consideration in exchange for her promise to give a &quot;firm offer&quot; and her promise cannot be enforced against her as an option contract.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Lucy's offer did not create an option contract, and she could revoke her offer at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer</strong></p>
<p>Here offer is by merchant because A is a merchant</p>
<p>Here A stated to leave the offer open  because A said that it is open for a week</p>
<p>Here time period stated is week because A said it is week</p>
<p>Here A cannot revoke the offer because it is a merchant's firm offer</p>
<p>Here B can accept the offer even if after A has revoked the offer because merchants firm offer can be accepted even after revoked by offeror.   </p>
<p>Therefore ...</p>
