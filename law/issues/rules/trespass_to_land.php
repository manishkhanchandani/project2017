<p>Under tort law <strong>TRESPASS TO LAND</strong> is an <strong>intentional act </strong>by the defendant causing an <strong>unauthorized entry</strong> onto, over, or under the <strong>land of the plaintiff.</strong> The defendant is liable for nominal damages and all actual damages caused by the entry.</p>
<p>The entry may be by the defendant personally or by some person or object directed or placed on the land by the defendant. When an object is placed on the land it constitutes a &ldquo;continuing trespass.&rdquo; No damage is necessary, but the defendant is liable for all damage actually caused. And if malice can be shown the defendant may be liable for punitive damages. </p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>
Here D was <strong>over the land </strong>of the World Tribune because he "hovered" over the "building." (or facts from hypo)  And he caused P to go <strong>onto the land</strong> because he put P on the "ledge." (or facts from hypo)  This caused <strong>actual damage</strong> because P accidentally caused a "panel to fall." (or facts from hypo)  Additional <strong>damages are implied </strong>by the fact &quot;firemen&quot; worked in the building &quot;for hours&quot; trying to rescue P.  (or facts from hypo)  This disruption probably <strong>caused Tribune</strong> to suffer lost wages and lost profits.</p>
<p>
Further, the possibility of <strong>malice</strong> is implied by the fact that D worked for one newspaper, the Daily Planet, and he disrupted business activities at what appears to be a competing newspaper, the World Tribune.</p>
<p>
Therefore D would be liable for all damages he actually caused Tribune based on trespass to land, and may also be liable for <strong>punitive damages </strong>if implied malice could be proven.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Therefore the defendant may be liable for trespass to land.  </p>
