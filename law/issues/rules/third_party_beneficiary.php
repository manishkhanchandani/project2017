<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, A <strong>THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY</strong> contract is a legally enforced contract entered by <strong>two parties</strong> for the <strong>intended purpose</strong> of <strong>benefiting</strong> a third party.</p>
<p>An <strong>INCIDENTAL</strong> beneficiary, one that was <strong>not intended</strong> to benefit from a contract between others, has <strong>no ability</strong> to enforce the contract or seek damages.</p>
<p>

<strong>Intended Third party beneficiary</strong> has a legal right to enforce the contract against the promisors. This is called "<strong>standing</strong>". In some jurisdictions, intended third party beneficiary must be "<strong>vested</strong>", explained below.</p>
<p><strong>

Creditor and Donee Beneficiaries</strong></p>
<p>

If promisees enters into third-party beneficiary contracts to <strong>satisfy legal obligations</strong>, the intended third party beneficiaries have a <strong>legal right</strong> to enforce the contracts against the promisees. In this case the intended third-party beneficiaries are called "creditor beneficiaries".</p>
<p>
If promisees enters into third-party beneficiary contracts for <strong>gratuitous purposes,</strong> the intended third-party beneficiaries have <strong>NO legal right</strong> to enforce the contracts against the promisees. In this case intended third party beneficiaries are called "donee beneficiaries".</p>
<p>
<strong>Intended third-party beneficiaries</strong> always have <strong>standing</strong> to enforce third-party beneficiary contracts against <strong>promisors</strong>, whether they are donee or creditor beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>

<p><strong>
Standing</strong></p>
<p>

Parties seeking a remedy must have a<strong> legal right </strong>to enforce the contract. This is called <strong>standing</strong>. Original parties always have standing towards each other. In case of third party beneficiary, third party do not have standing unless they are "<strong>vested</strong>" (explained below). Incidental beneficiaries do not have standing and so they cannot enforce the contract.</p>
<p><strong>Vesting</strong></p>
<p>

Before third-parties can enforce third-party beneficiary contracts they must be "vested". To be "vested", third-party beneficiary must "act in reliance" on the existence of the third party beneficiary contract.</p>

<p><strong>Groucho's rights under a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY CONTRACT is one with a main purpose of providing a benefit to a third party. The contract can be enforced by the original party, the promisee, or by a vested intended beneficiary.</p>
<p>

A beneficiary may be a DONEE (of a gift) or a CREDITOR (payment of a debt) beneficiary. The beneficiary vests upon becoming aware of and changing position in reliance on the contract.</p>
<p>

Here the purpose of the contract is to benefit Chico because he was to get a "new Dodge" as a "birthday present." Therefore this is a third-party benefit contract. Chico is an intended DONEE beneficiary because it is a "birthday present."</p>
<p>

Groucho is the promisee because Harpo promised to "deliver" the car in "two weeks." Harpo is the promisor because he has promised to deliver the car to Chico.</p>
<p>

Therefore, this is a third-party beneficiary contract, and Groucho as promisee can enforce it.</p>
<p>

<strong>3) Groucho's REMEDIES?</strong></p>
<p>

Under the PERFECT TENDER RULE of the UCC a non-breaching buyer in a non-delivery situation can demand conforming goods, repudiate the contract or by goods to cover and demand the excess of the cover price over the contract price.</p>
<p>

Here Harpo has breached because he did not deliver the promised car.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Groucho can demand delivery from Harpo or repudiate the contract and demand return of his $2,000. If he covers by buying the car elsewhere he can demand the excess of his cover price, if any, over the contract price.</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Chico's rights as a THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY?</strong></p>
<p>Third-party beneficiary contracts are defined above. Chico is an intended third-party beneficiary because the known purpose of the original contract was to give him a "birthday present." He vested when he became aware of the original contract and changed position in reliance.</p>
<p>

A vested third-party beneficiary can enforce the contract against the promisor in the same manner as the promisee.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Chico can enforce the original contract against Harpo in the same manner and extent as Groucho</p>
