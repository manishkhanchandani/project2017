<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under the EGG -SHELL PLAINTIFF concept , <strong>defendants are liable</strong> for<strong> all damages</strong> they actually cause plaintiffs, even if the plaintiffs , through no fault of their own, <strong>have pre-existing conditions</strong> that make them especially vulnerable to injury. </p>
<p>The doctrine of the law is that "defendants must take plaintiffs as they find them."</p>
<p>Persons that are <strong>extremely vulnerable to injury</strong>, through<strong> no fault of their ow</strong>n, are called &quot;<strong>egg-shell plaintiffs</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>[Discussion of "egg-shell plaintiffs" is the intended issue when the plaintiff is a partial cause of her own injury, but is not negligent because any other reasonable person in the same situation would do the same thing (e.g. a little old lady walks across the street slowly because that is as fast as she can walk).]</p>
<p>If defendant breach their duties and thereby actually and proximately cause injury to any plaintiff then the defendants are liable for ALL the injuries caused, even if amount, type, and extend of injury suffered by plaintiff is totally unforeseeable by the defendant at the time of the negligent act.
