<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>PRIVATE NUISANCE</strong> is an <strong>unreasonable interference</strong> with a person's <strong>use and enjoyment </strong>of their own land.</p>
<p><strong>COMING TO THE NUISANCE?    </strong></p>
<p>Under tort law COMING TO THE NUISANCE is the defense that the plaintiff moved to the location where the condition complained of already existed. It is a complete bar in a MINORITY view, but in the MAJORITY view it is only a factor to be considered in determining damages.    </p>
<p><strong>NUISANCE REMEDIES?    </strong></p>
<p>The REMEDIES for a nuisance action include both money damages and injunctive relief.    </p>
<p><strong>Injunction</strong></p>
<p>

An injunction is a measure that prevents the defendant from continuing the action that the plaintiff seeks relief from.</p>
<p>If the nuisance is a temporary situation money damages measured by the loss of use for the period of the nuisance will be an adequate remedy. </p>
<p>If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive relief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, and the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the interests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive relief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property value caused by the nuisance. </p>
