<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>DEFAMATION</strong> is a <strong>FALSE statement</strong> of material fact <strong>PUBLISHED</strong> to others about the <strong>plaintiff</strong> CAUSING DAMAGE to <strong>REPUTATION</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Libel or Slander</strong></p>
<p>Defamation may be <strong>SLANDER</strong>, an oral statement, or <strong>LIBEL</strong>, a written statement. </p>
<p><strong>Privileges</strong></p>
<p>But many false statements are <strong>PRIVILEGED</strong> where the defendant speaks to <strong>defend</strong> a<strong> private interest</strong>, <strong>group interest</strong> or the <strong>public interest</strong> and does so <strong>without malice</strong> and in a <strong>reasonable manner calculated</strong> to <strong>defend that interest</strong> <strong>without</strong> unnecessarily <strong>harming</strong> the plaintiff.</p>
<p><strong>Per Se </strong></p>
<p>Injury to <strong>reputation</strong> will be <strong>presumed</strong> where there is <strong>LIBEL or SLANDER PER SE</strong>. SLANDER PER SE is found where the false statement alleges <strong>CRIMINAL</strong> behavior, <strong>LOATHSOME</strong> disease, <strong>UNCHASTE</strong> behavior or improper <strong>BUSINESS</strong> practices.

<p><strong>New York Times and its progeny</strong></p>
<p>Under NEW YORK TIMES and its progeny, a <strong>PUBLIC FIGURE PLAINTIFF</strong> must prove <strong>ACTUAL MALICE</strong>, that the false statement was made <strong>with knowledge</strong> or <strong>reckless disregard of its falseness</strong>, in order to recover in a defamation action. </p>
<p>A<strong> PUBLIC FIGURE</strong> is a person who has acted to put themselves in the <strong>public spotlight</strong>. </p>
<p>Further, where a matter of <strong>PUBLIC CONCERN</strong> is at issue, or where the plaintiff seeks punitive damages, the plaintiff must at least prove <strong>NEGLIGENCE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>More Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Certain types of defamatory statements were damaging to reputation. Those are called defamation per se. If a statement is defamation per se, the Court may award a money judgment to plaintiffs without requiring any further evidence they suffered injury.</p>
<p>Other defamatory statements that were are not so clearly damaging to reputation were called defamation per quod. If a statement was defamation per quod, the Court could not award a money judgment to the plaintiffs unless they presented convincing evidence they suffered monetary losses as a result of the statements.    </p>
<p>Whether statements are defamation per se or defamation pre quod depends on three factors:    </p>
<p>1. Whether statements are insinuations that have to be interpreted by the listener or clearly defamatory statements about the plaintiff;    </p>
<p>2. Whether the statements are written or oral; and    </p>
<p>3. The subject matter of the statements.    </p>
<p><strong>Insinuations    </strong></p>
<p>Under the common law insinuations that might harm the reputation of the plaintiff were always defamation per quod whether they are oral or written, and no matter what the subject matter might be.    </p>
<p>Three types of &quot;insinuations&quot; were recognized by the common law: innuendo, colloquium, and inducement.    </p>
<p>The important point is that if defendants do not clearly identify the plaintiffs as the subject of their statements, or the statements do not clearly make factual assertions about the plaintiffs that would damage their reputations, they are &quot;insinuations&quot; and defamations per quod in all cases.    </p>
<p>If defendants make statements that clearly identify the plaintiff and allege facts that would injure the plaintiff's reputation, they are clearly defamatory. But whether they were defamation per se or defamation per quod depended on whether the statements are libel or slander.    </p>
<p><strong>A. Libel:    </strong></p>
<p>A defamatory statement is libel if it is written or recorded in a manner that gives its damaging effects longevity. Under the common law a written defamatory statement about the plaintiff was libel and libel was always defamation per se, regardless of the subject matter.    </p>
<p><strong>B. Slander    </strong></p>
<p>A defamatory statement is slander if it is oral or transitory in nature so that the damaging effect soon dissipates. Under common law an oral defamatory statement about the plaintiff was slander but it was only defamation per se if it accused the plaintiff of one of the following four things:    </p>
<ul>
    <li>Having committed a serious crime;</li>
    <li>Having a loathsome disease;</li>
    <li> Engaging in sexual misconduct. (Unchaste Behavior) OR</li>
    <li>Engaging in business or professional misconduct;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> CLUB</p>
<p>Any slander regarding any other subject matter was always defamation per quod.</p>
<p>If plaintiffs prove the elements of defamation per se the Court can award money judgments without any proof the plaintiffs suffered monetary losses. These are general damages. If the plaintiff also proves the statements caused monetary losses those are special damages and they can be awarded in addition. This is often phrased, &quot;The plaintiff can get generals without proving specials.&quot;    </p>
<p>If plaintiffs only prove the elements of defamation per quod the Court cannot award any damages at all until unless the plaintiffs prove the defamations caused monetary losses. Those are special damages. If plaintiffs do prove special damages, the Court can award general damages in addition to the special damages. But if plaintiffs fail to prove defamations per quod caused monetary losses the plaintiffs get nothing. This is often phrased, &quot;The plaintiff must prove specials to get generals&quot;.</p>
