<p>Under tort law defendants that create <strong>reasonably foreseeable dangers to others</strong> have a DUTY based on PERIL to act reasonably to protect others from those dangers.    </p>
<p>Under Palsgraf Cardozo said that defendants that create peril do not owe a duty to protect those <strong>outside the zone of danger</strong> created by their acts so they should not be liable to them. But Andrews said defendants who breach duties based on peril should be <strong>liable to everyone</strong> actually and proximately caused injury, even if they are outside the zone of danger, the same as is true under the Rescuer Doctrine.    </p>
<p>Zone of danger is an <strong>area</strong> within which defendants actions created reasonably foreseeable peril to others. </p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Under <strong>PALSGRAF</strong>, <strong>Cardozo</strong> said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the <strong>zone of danger </strong>caused by the <strong>defendant's</strong> acts. The <strong>Zone of Danger</strong> is the <strong>area</strong> where the defendant's <strong>acts</strong> create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.</p>
<p>
<strong>Andrews</strong> held that if the defendant <strong>owes a duty </strong>to <strong>anyone</strong> and <strong>breaches</strong> it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.</p>
<p>
Here the <strong>Zone of Danger</strong> was the <u>gravel bar and the water area immediately around it</u> (put facts from hypo) because it was not reasonably foreseeable the <u>firecrackers</u> (put facts from hypo) could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was <strong>nobody placed in danger</strong> within the <strong>zone of danger</strong> because &quot;no one else was around&quot; and there was &quot;nothing that could burn&quot; (use facts from hypo) .</p>
<p>
P appeared to be<strong> outside / inside</strong> the <strong>zone of danger</strong> caused by D's activities because she was a "<u>half mile downstream.</u>" (use facts from hypo). P might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the &quot;<u>gravel bar</u>&quot; (use facts from hypo) because D should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.</p>
<p><strong>
Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, it would be difficult for P to prove that D had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p> Here D could only have a duty based on <strong>PERIL</strong>, and there is little evidence D's act created <strong>reasonably foreseeable peril </strong>to anyone. The only foreseeable danger he caused by <u>pushing the log in the river is that it might hit someone swimming in the river downstream.</u> (facts from hypo) Therefore the "zone of danger" created by his act is the <u>surface of the river downstream</u>. (facts from hypo) There is no evidence <u>anyone was in the river, and P was certainly not because she was on the bridge</u>.. (facts from hypo)</p>
<p>

Therefore, there is no evidence D created any foreseeable peril to anyone, and if that could not be proven he did not owe P or anyone else a duty.</p>
