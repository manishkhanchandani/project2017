<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual<strong> intent communicated to the offeree</strong> such that an objective person would reasonably believe <strong>assent would form a bargain</strong>. </p>
<p>At common law, a communication was only deemed sufficient to constitute an offer if it specified the <strong>parties</strong>, <strong>subject matter</strong>, <strong>quantity</strong>, <strong>price</strong>, and the <strong>time</strong> of performance (<strong>Q-tips</strong> - quantity, time, identity of parties, subject matter)</p>
<p>At UCC, the UCC deems a communication sufficient to constitute an offer if it specifies the <strong>parties</strong> and the <strong>quantity</strong>. The UCC provides &quot;<strong>GAP FILLERS</strong>&quot; that may be used by the court to determine any additional terms. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Example 1 (Was the ADVERTISEMENT an OFFER?)</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual<strong> intent communicated to the offeree</strong> such that an objective person would reasonably believe <strong>assent would form a bargain</strong>. <strong>Advertisements</strong> are generally<strong> not offers</strong> because they usually <strong>fail to identify the parties or the quantity</strong> being offered.</p>
<p>Here the advertisement was<strong> not specific as to the parties</strong> because it did not guarantee that Lucy would rent to the first person to respond.</p>
<p>
Therefore, the advertisement was not an offer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Example 2 (Was the 9:00 statement by Homer an OFFER? )</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual<strong> intent communicated to the offeree</strong> such that an objective person would reasonably believe <strong>assent would form a bargain</strong>.</p>
<p>Here the statement by Homer <strong>did not appear to manifest intent to enter into a bargain</strong> because even though he said, "I accept" he added that he "had to see the house first." No<strong> reasonable person would believe</strong> assent to that statement would form a bargain because it was clear he wanted to "see the house first."</p>
<p>

Therefore the statement was not an offer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Example 3 (Was the 9:00 response by Lucy an OFFER?)</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual<strong> intent communicated to the offeree</strong> such that an objective person would reasonably believe <strong>assent would form a bargain</strong>.</p>
<p>Here the statement by Lucy<strong> did manifest intent to enter into a bargain</strong> because she said "It's a deal. I will rent to you for $550." A <strong>reasonable person would believe</strong> assent to that statement would form a bargain.</p>
<p>

Therefore that statement was an offer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Example 4 (Did Bob OFFER to sell the tuxedo?)</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual<strong> intent communicated to the offeree</strong> such that an objective person would reasonably believe <strong>assent would form a bargain</strong>.</p>
<p>Here Bob manifested an<strong> intent to sell a tuxedo</strong> because he "suggested Al buy" the tuxedo. And a<strong> reasonable person would believe assent</strong> to this communication would form a bargain.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Bob made an offer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Example 5 (Was the catalogue an OFFER?)</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual<strong> intent communicated to the offeree</strong> such that an objective person would reasonably believe <strong>assent would form a bargain</strong>. An advertisement is never a valid offer unless it clearly identifies the QUANTITY of goods for sale and the PARTY to whom the offeror is willing to sell them.</p>
<p>Here the <strong>catalogue is not an offer </strong>because it is just a price list that does not specify the quantity of any product Sellco is willing to sell. No reasonable person would believe merely 'assenting' to the catalogue would alone form a bargain, so a catalogue cannot be an 'offer'..</p>
<p>Therefore, the catalogue itself is not an offer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Example 6 (6/2/99 OFFER by Buyco?)</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law, an OFFER is a <strong>manifestation</strong> of present contractual<strong> intent communicated to the offeree</strong> such that an objective person would reasonably believe <strong>assent would form a bargain</strong>.</p>
<p>Here the <strong>communication from Buyco expresses present contractual intent</strong> because it says &quot;we hereby accept&quot;. The offer is <strong>specific as to parties </strong>because it says &quot;we&quot; and &quot;your&quot;, and it is <strong>specific as to a quantity </strong>of &quot;10,000&quot;. This is <strong>specific enough for an offer</strong> because it objectively appears assent would form a bargain.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is a valid offer.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Example 7</strong></p>
<p>When Seller told Buyer he was "now willing to sell and therefore offer Blackacre to you for $50,000" he mentioned <strong>CONTRACTUAL INTENT</strong>. This was <strong>COMMUNICATED</strong> by letter to Buyer, the <strong>IDENTIFIED OFFEREE</strong>, with <strong>DEFINITE AND CERTAIN TERMS</strong>, i.e. (subject matter, Blackacre, price $50,000).</p>
<p>

Although the time of sale was not mentioned it will be implied under common law as a <strong>reasonable time</strong>. The time for acceptance of this offer was not specified and as such it will be kept open until revoked or untill a reasonable time has elapsed.</p>
<p>

Seller made a valid offer to Buyer to buy Blackacre for $50,000.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sample Answer</strong></p>
<p>Here the communication from A expresses present contractual intent bcause he says &quot;I accept&quot; ....</p>
<p>Here offer is <strong>specific to parties</strong> because it says A and B...</p>
<p>Here offer is <strong>specific to a quantity </strong>because it says 10,000..</p>
<p>Here offer is <strong>specific to price</strong> because it says $1 per box...</p>
<p>Here offer is <strong>specific to time</strong> because it says &quot;on July 1&quot; ...</p>
<p>Here offer is <strong>specific to subject </strong>because it says &quot;cars&quot; ...</p>
<p>Here a r<strong>easonable person would believe assent to this communication would form  a bargain</strong> because of intent, communicated to buyer with Q-tips.      </p>
<p>Therefore there is a valid offer. </p>
