<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under criminal law INSANITY is a defense that negates criminal intent. Under the <strong>M'NAUGHTEN RULE</strong> a person is insane if a <strong>disease of the mind</strong> so impairs their reasoning that they are <strong>unable to appreciate </strong>the nature and quality of their acts or to<strong> know that they are wrong</strong>. Under the <strong>IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE </strong>theory a person may raise the defense of insanity if they are unable to control their acts, even if they know the act is wrong.</p>
