<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE</strong> means that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was so <strong>DIRECT, NATURA</strong>L and <strong>FORESEEABLE</strong>, so <strong>close in time and place</strong>, resulting from a <strong>CHAIN OF CAUSATION</strong> begun by the defendant's acts, <strong>unbroken</strong> by <strong>UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENTS</strong> that the law will impose liability for the result. </p>
<p><strong>Rule with Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>PROXIMATE CAUSE</strong> means that the injury to the plaintiff was <strong>foreseeable</strong>, <strong>close in time</strong> and <strong>place</strong> to the acts of the defendant and a <strong>direct result </strong>of a <strong>chain of causation</strong> unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events.</p>
<p>

Generally when there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the last, unforeseeable,

intentional act will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting off all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent additional specific facts.</p>
<p>

Here P was rather far away from D in <strong>time and space</strong>, and it would<strong> not be foreseeable </strong>she could be <strong>injured</strong> by a <u>firecracker at that distance</u>. (take facts from hypo) Further a <strong>reasonable person could not foresee</strong> that <u>a firecracker would cause money to be stolen</u>. (take facts from hypo) Finally, <strong>even</strong> if D was the <strong>proximate cause</strong> of P <u>falling in the river</u>, (take facts from hypo) he was <strong>not the proximate cause</strong> of <u>her money being stolen</u> because <strong>Harry</strong>'s criminal <strong>act</strong> was an <strong>unforeseeable intervening</strong> event.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
Therefore, P probably could not prove D was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of <u>her money being taken</u>.</p>
