<p>Under tort law a person is liable for <strong>ABUSE OF PROCESS</strong> if they have brought a <strong>civil or criminal action</strong> against <strong>another person</strong> without a <strong>legitimate basis </strong>out of <strong>malice</strong> or for an <strong>improper purpose</strong>. </p>
<p>Here D brought a <strong>civil action</strong> against P because he "sued P for slander." (or facts from hypo). And he had <strong>no legitimate basis</strong> because all of P's statements were true. (or facts from hypo). D acted out of <strong>malice</strong> and for an <strong>improper purpose</strong> because he was trying to refute P's statements and hide the truth.

(or facts from hypo). </p>
<p>Therefore, D could be <strong>liable</strong> for <strong>abuse of process</strong>.</p>
