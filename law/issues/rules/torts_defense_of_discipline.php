<p>Under tort law a person with <strong>recognized authority</strong> (schoolteacher, bus driver, airplane pilot, policeman, parent, etc.) is privileged to <strong>act reasonably</strong> given the circumstances in a manner that <strong>otherwise might constitute</strong> a <strong>battery</strong> or false imprisonment.    </p>
<p><strong>Description:    </strong></p>
<p>Defendants may be privileged to use reasonable force because of their position of authority. This is usually a defense to an action for false imprisonment and battery. The defendant must show that their actions were necessary, justified and reasonable. This is a rare defense for those people who have a need to enforce discipline and order (e.g. teachers, bus drivers, pilots, ship captains, etc.) It is not discussed by some texts, and it overlaps the defense of necessity.</p>
