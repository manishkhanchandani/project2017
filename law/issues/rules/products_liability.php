<p>Under <strong>PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW</strong> a person who places an unreasonably <strong>dangerous</strong> product<strong> into the steam of commerce</strong> may be <strong>liable for the injury</strong> it causes.</p>
<p>There are five basic theories on which a product liability action may be brought: <strong>Intentional</strong>, Breach of<strong> Express Warranty</strong>, Breach of<strong> Implied Warranty</strong>, <strong>Negligence</strong> and <strong>Strict Liability</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Unreasonably Dangerous</strong></p>
<p>A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses <strong>serious and likely dangers</strong>, that 2) could be <strong>reduced</strong> or eliminated easily, 3) <strong>without damaging product utility</strong>, or else 4) the <strong>product utility</strong> does <strong>not justify</strong> the <strong>dangers</strong> posed. </p>
<p><strong>Defect Types</strong></p>
<p>In order to recover, it must be proved that the product is defective in:    </p>
<p><strong>Design</strong> (product designed as intended, but creates an unreasonable danger to consumers) - but beware of state of the art as a defense; if it's unavoidably unsafe and its benefits outweighs its dangers, there may be no liability.    </p>
<p><strong>Manufacture</strong> (product is not made as intended) - look for product to be different from the rest due to bad assembly, materials, or parts    </p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> (dangers not apparent to customers)</p>
<p><strong>MacPherson v. Buick</strong></p>
<p>In this landmark case, Justice Cardozo dispensed with the previously applied requirement of privity of contract in products liability cases and extended the manufacturer's duty of care to include the ultimate consumer of the product, whether or not the consumer was the actual purchaser of the product. Later cases extended the duty to include not just the purchaser or the ultimate consumer, but to include all persons and property likely to be endangered by the product's probable use, such as the consumer's family or guests, or even near bystanders.</p>
