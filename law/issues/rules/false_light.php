<p>Under tort law FALSE LIGHT is the tort of <strong>publishing a false portrayal</strong> of a person in a manner that would cause them <strong>embarrassment or inconvenience</strong>.</p>
<p>Here D <strong>published a portrayal</strong> about P because it "reported she was a secret philanthropist (or facts from hypo) ". This was a <strong>false portrayal </strong>because she was a "tightwad." (or facts from hypo). And this <strong>caused her embarrassment</strong> because she was "besieged with requests" that were "professionally impossible" to reject (or facts from hypo). P's <strong>damages</strong> would generally be measured by the<strong> amount of embarrassment </strong>she was caused.</p>
<p>Therefore, D may be liable for <strong>invasion of privacy</strong> under a <strong>false light</strong> theory.</p>
