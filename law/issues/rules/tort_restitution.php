Under tort law plaintiffs have a legal right to "<strong>waive the tort</strong>" and instead of seeking an award of damages based on the injury they have actually suffered they may demand <strong>LEGAL RESTITUTION</strong>, an award of a <strong>money judgment </strong>measured by the amount the defendants have wrongfully benefited as a result of their tortious acts. The purpose of this is to <strong>PREVENT UNJUST ENRICHMENT</strong> by tortfeasors.
