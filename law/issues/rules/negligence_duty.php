Under tort law the general rule is that a person has no duty to act to defend others from harm. A <strong>DUTY</strong> to act to protect others from harm <strong>ONLY</strong> arises under<strong> five scenarios</strong>: [SCRAP] <strong>STATUTE</strong>, <strong>CONTRACT</strong>, <strong>RELATIONSHIP</strong>, <strong>ASSUMPTION</strong> or where <strong>PERIL</strong> to the plaintiff is caused by the defendant.
