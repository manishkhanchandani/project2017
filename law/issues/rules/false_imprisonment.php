<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law, <strong>FALSE IMPRISONMENT</strong> is an <strong>intentional act</strong> to cause and that does cause the plaintiff to be<strong> confined</strong> to a <strong>defined area </strong>without any reasonable apparent means of <strong>reasonable exit</strong>. Plaintiff must <strong>actually know</strong> they are confined, but do not have to know the confinement is illegal.
    
</p>
<p>Here D <strong>intentionally </strong>acted because it was a &quot;prank&quot; (or facts from hypo) , and he <strong>confined</strong> P with <strong>no reasonably apparent means</strong> of reasonable <strong>exit</strong> because he put him on a &quot; ledge&quot;. (or facts from hypo)  And P was <strong>aware of his confinement</strong> because he was &quot;apprehensive&quot; of falling and "taunted" by the crowd. (or facts from hypo) </p>
<p>
D may argue that P was<strong> not actually confined</strong> because all he had to do was go through the &quot;window&quot;.  (or facts from hypo) But that <strong>means of exit was not reasonably apparent</strong> because even the &quot;firemen&quot; who tried to get P down for &quot;hours&quot; did not realize discover it.  (or facts from hypo) </p>
<p>Therefore the defendant may be liable for false imprisonment. </p>
