<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law a <strong>BATTERY</strong> is an <strong>intentional act</strong> to <strong>cause and does cause</strong> a <strong>touching</strong> of the person of the plaintiff resulting in <strong>harm or offense</strong> to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Here D acted <strong>intentionally</strong> because he intended to pull a &quot; prank&quot; (or facts from hypo), and he caused a <strong>touching</strong> because he &quot;lifted and flew&quot; Gates into the air  (or facts from hypo). This would be an <strong>offensive touching</strong> to a <strong>reasonable person</strong> because it is socially offensive to be grabbed in this manner by a stranger  (or facts from hypo).</p>
<p>Therefore the defendant may be liable for battery. </p>
