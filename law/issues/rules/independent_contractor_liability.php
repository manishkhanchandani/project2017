<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law defendant who hires an<strong> INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR</strong> to perform duties that are not &quot;non-delegable&quot; by law is <strong>NOT vicariously liable </strong>for torts committed by the contractor and can only be <strong>directly liable</strong> because of <strong>negligent selection or negligent entrustment </strong>of the contractor by the defendant. An independent contractor is a person selected to provide labor services <strong>without close and regular supervision</strong>.    </p>
<p>Here...because...Therefore. </p>
