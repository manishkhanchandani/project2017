<p>Under tort law <strong>INTRUSION</strong> is an <strong>unreasonable intrusion</strong> into the <strong>peace</strong> and <strong>solitude</strong> of the plaintiff. </p>
<p><strong>Damages</strong> are measured by the <strong>value of lost solitude</strong> to the plaintiff.    </p>
<p>Here there was an <strong>unreasonable intrusion</strong> because D sent a "submarine" to photograph P through a "telephoto lens" (or facts from hypo). It <strong>disturbed her peace and solitude</strong> because she had attempted to be alone in a secluded place "miles" from shore with a "posted lookout." (or facts from hypo).  P <strong>suffered damages</strong> because it "<strong>embarrassed her</strong>" into "<strong>seclusion</strong>" in her home for "<strong>six weeks</strong>."
(or facts from hypo).
    
    
    D would argue that P had <strong>no reasonable expectation of privacy</strong> because she was "in international waters." (or facts from hypo). P would counter that she had <strong>a reasonable expectation of privacy</strong> because of the location and precautions she had taken. (or facts from hypo).    </p>
<p>Therefore, D may be <strong>liable for intrusion</strong>.</p>
