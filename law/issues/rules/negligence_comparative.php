<p><strong>Rule 1</strong></p>
<p>In many States the <strong>COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE</strong> approach does not bar the negligent plaintiff from recovery but <strong>reduces </strong>the plaintiff's <strong>recovery</strong> to reflect the <strong>degree of fault</strong> shared by the plaintiff. Some states bar a plaintiff from recovery if they are over half to blame for an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</strong> is a complete <strong>bar to recovery</strong> if the <strong>plaintiff</strong> was <strong>responsible</strong> in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY approach is <strong>COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE</strong> which just <strong>reduces</strong> the plaintiff's recovery based on the <strong>degree of fault </strong>of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own injuries is completely barred from recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>D's better argument is that P <strong>was contributorily (comparatively) negligent</strong> because she <u>sat &quot;carelessly&quot; and that placed her in PERIL of falling</u>. (take facts from hypo)
    
    Therefore, D could easily prove P was &quot;careless&quot; and partly responsible for her own injury.</p>
