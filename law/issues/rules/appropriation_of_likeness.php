And the <strong>use was not authorized </strong>because she did not give permission (or facts from hypo). The purpose of the billboards <strong>was to profit</strong> by implying she <strong>endorsed their paper</strong>. P's damages would generally be measured by the <strong>profits D made from using her likeness</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore D may be <strong>liable</strong> for appropriation of likeness. </p>
