<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under the tort doctrine of TRANSFERRED INTENT, a defendant who commits an <strong>intentional tort</strong> towards <strong>anybody</strong> generally becomes <strong>liable</strong> for every injury inflicted on <strong>everybody</strong>, even if the injury caused or the person caused injury is not the original intent. </p>
<p>An exception is that Court generally will not find IIED based on transferred intent, and Courts may find only negligence and not an intentional tort by transferred intent if the original intent of the defendant was not malicious.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Here D <strong>intentionally</strong> acted to cause P to suffer assault, battery, false imprisonment and possibly intentional infliction of emotional distress, and he <strong>intended</strong> to cause a trespass to the land of the World Tribune. In turn, that caused P to suffer a &quot;harmful touching&quot;.</p>
<p>
Therefore, D would be liable to P for battery by transferred intent.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Therefore the defendant may be liable for transferred intent. </p>
