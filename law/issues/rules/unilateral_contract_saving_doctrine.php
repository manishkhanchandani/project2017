<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>In case of Unilateral Contracts</p>
<p>

Under the common law an offeror <strong>could revoke her offer at any time</strong> before acceptance. Modernly <strong>SAVING DOCTRINES</strong> have been adopted to prohibit the offeror of a unilateral contract from <strong>revoking</strong> for a <strong>reasonable time</strong> after becoming <strong>aware</strong> that the <strong>offeree has begun performance</strong> in acceptance.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Under that view Fester could revoke at any time, leaving Dottie without a remedy.</p>
<p>



Under an alternative view the offeror may revoke but the offeree has a right to RESTITUTION to avoid UNJUST ENRICHMENT.</p>
<p>



Here Dottie began performance in acceptance because she "sold her home", "moved" and "nursed Fester." And Fester was aware of her performance because he was alert despite his paralysis.</p>
<p>



Therefore, under the modern savings doctrines Dottie would usually be given a reasonable time to complete performance. Here a "reasonable time" is the rest of Fester's life, since that was the condition of the offer.</p>
