<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under the theory of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL an <strong>agreement</strong> that otherwise is <strong>unenforceable at law</strong> for <strong>lack of consideration</strong> may be <strong>enforced at equity</strong> to the extent necessary to <strong>avoid injustice</strong>. In order to plead equity a party must have <strong>CLEAN HANDS</strong>. Promissory Estoppel applies where the party to be bound made a 1) <strong>promise</strong> with 2) intent to<strong> induce reliance</strong> and there 3) was <strong>reasonable reliance</strong> and 4) <strong>failure to enforce the promise</strong> would cause an injustice.</p>

<p><strong> If the contract of April 1 is legally unenforceable by Deccra, what equitable argument might it make?  (PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?)

</strong></p>
<p>Under the doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL a party can seek enforcement of an otherwise unenforceable promise where 1) a party made a promise, 2) intending to induce reliance, 3) there was reasonable reliance by the other party and 4) injustice will result if the promise is not enforced..</p>
<p>

Here Al made a promise to Deccra because he “agreed on April 1 to a new arrangement”, and he did that intending to induce reliance.</p>
<p>

Al would argue that Decca did not reasonably rely because it was aware Al was a minor and could repudiate the contract at any time. Deccra would argue that Al would reap an UNJUST ENRICHMENT because it incurred "$360,000 in distribution expense."</p>
<p>

Therefore, it would appear that Decca's restitution to Al should be reduced by this amount and restricted to the actual profit made by Decca.</p>

<p><strong> Enforceable by PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL?</strong></p>
<p>Under the theory of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL an agreement that otherwise is unenforceable at law for a lack of consideration may be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to avoid injustice. In order to plead equity a party must have CLEAN HANDS. Promissory estoppel applies where the party to be bound made a 1) promise with 2) intent to induce reliance and there 3) was reasonable reliance and 4) failure to enforce the promise would cause an injustice.</p>
<p>

Here Homer made a promise because he "promised" to pay $30,000. And he did that with intent to induce reliance because Homer didn’t want to “live in a tent”. Bill reasonably relied on Homer’s promise because he "hired Fred" in "reasonable reliance" on the promise. But there is NO INJUSTICE because Bill was only induced by Homer's lie to do exactly what he was already legally obligated to do -- finish the house. Homer reaped NO UNJUST ENRICHMENT because he only got the house that he had already been promised, and had promised to pay for.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Bill was not induced to do anything he was not otherwise obligated to do, and Homer did not receive anything of value that he was not entitled to.</p>
<p>

Since there was no injustice, promissory estoppel would not apply.</p>
<p>

Further, Bill had UNCLEAN HANDS because he had a legal duty to perform under the contract, and he elicited Homer’s promise to pay $30,000 more by threatening to breach the contract. A Court of equity will not act to enforce a promise elicited by a threat of illegal conduct.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Homer’s promise to pay more cannot be enforced at either law or equity.</p>

<p>If a plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law, they may be able to obtain a remedy in equity. Here Dottie has an adequate remedy at law as to the promise of the stock, so she cannot seek enforcement at equity as to that part of Fester’s promise. But since she has no adequate remedy as to the promise of the house, she can seek a remedy at equity as to that part of her claim.</p>
<p>

Under the equitable doctrine of PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL a promise or contract that cannot be enforced at law might be enforced at equity to the extent necessary to prevent unjust enrichment where 1) the party to be bound made a promise ,2) intending to induce reliance, 3) there was reasonable reliance on the promise by the party seeking equity, and 4) justice demands enforcement.</p>
<p>

Here there was a promise because Fester "promised" to give Dottie the house. And Fester made the promise intending to induce reliance by Dottie because he wanted her to “move" to where he lived and "nurse" him. Dottie reasonably relied because she trusted him as an "honest, God- fearing Christian." And there would be injustice otherwise because she nursed him for "10 years."</p>
<p>

To enforce the promise Dottie would argue that an award of money damages is insufficient to prevent unjust enrichment because the “house” is unique property. A Court of equity may order title to the house conveyed to her (EQUITABLE REPLEVIN) to prevent injustice.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Dottie may be able to enforce the promise in equity even though it could not be enforced at law.</p>
