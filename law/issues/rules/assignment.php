<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>An assignment is the transfer of contractual rights to a third party.</p>
<p>

A delegation is transfer of a contractual duty to a third party.</p>
<p>

An assignment that declares "all of my rights" or similar language is both an assignment and delegation of duties.</p>
<p>

Parties promised benefits by a contract are promisees as to those benefits. Promisees can convey their contract rights to other parties. This is called assignment. The parties who are assigned the rights are called "assignees", and the promisees who assigned their rights are called "assginors". For clarity you may call these "promisee/assignors".</p>
<p>

Identify each of the parties as follows: "promisor", "promisee / assignor", "gratuitous assignee", "contractual assignee". Assignees may also be called "donee" or "creditor". The promisor is also called an "obligor". The contract that created the rights being assigned may be called a "master contract" for purpose of clarity.</p>
<p>

A. Law favors assignment</p>
<p>

Most assignments of contract benefits concern who gets paid.</p>
<p>

Promises to "Not Assgin" contract rights are considered to be covenants unless contract language makes it quite clear non-assignments is intended to be an express condition. Like for example "All assignments are null and void".</p>
<p>

Promisor will claim that the assignment was prohibited by contract. However, generally an anti-assignment clause only destroys the right to assign, not the power. To destroy the power, the contract language would have to say: "All assignments are null and void." This language is not present.</p>
<p>

Contract benefits cannot be assigned if the duties of the promisor would be substantially changed. (for example if sears agree to put sliding's on Oven's house, Oven is promisee, Oven sells house and assigns his rights to get the sliding to new owner because it is same house. That does not change Sears duty, but Oven cannot assign his rights to owner of some different house and tells sears to put sliding on that new house).
</p>
<p>
B. Breach of Covenant "Not to Assign"</p>
<p>

When a "covenant not to assign" contract right is breached, it is a breach of contract by the promisee/assignor, but the burden is on the non-breaching party, promisor, to prove damages. And often there are no damages, so the breach has no real effect.</p>
<p>

C. When assignment become Effective</p>
<p>

Assignments of contract rights requires a clearly expressed statement of present intent by promisee/assignors to convey existing rights to identified assignees. A statment of present intent means a statement that says, "I hereby give you ...".</p>
<p>

Promisors (obligors) are obligated to convey contract benefits to assignees upon receiving notice of contract assignments. If promisors are not given notice, they are obligated to convey contract benefits to promisees.</p>
<p>

Assignees obtain a legal rights to receive contract benefits upon notice of contract assignments unless they reject (disclaim) the benefits.
</p>
<p>
Promisee / assignors lose their rights to receive contract benefits upon receipt of notice by assignees that do not reject them.
</p>
<p>
D. Promisee / Assignor Loses Standing</p>
<p>

A promisee / assignor has no remaining contract rights after the assignment is effective. And since they have no contract rights, they have no standing to enforce the contract.</p>
<p>

E. Gratuitious and Contractual Assignments</p>
<p>

Contract rights may be assigned as a gratuitious / gift or in exchange for consideration.</p>
<p>

Gratuitious Assignments
</p>
<p>
When contract rights are assigned as gratuitious gesture they are "gratuituous assignments" or "gift assignments", and the assignees are "gratuitious assignees" or perhaps "donee assignees".</p>
<p>

Gratuitiuos assignments are merely "gift promises" and no contractual relationship is created between the promisee /assginor and the gratuitious assignee.</p>
<p>

Contractual Assignments</p>
<p>

When contract rights are assigned in exchange for consideration they are "contractual assignments", and the assignees are "contractual assginees" or perhaps "creditor assignees".</p>
<p>

Contractual assignments bind the promisee/assignor and assignees to contractual assignment agreements. For clarity these might be called "assignment contracts" to distinguish them from the "master contracts" that created the rights assigned.</p>
<p>

F. Revocation of Gratuitious Assignment</p>
<p>

Contractual assignments cannot be revoked as long as the parties are bound by the terms of the assignment contract. But if assignment contract fails, the assignment can be revoked by the promisee/assignor</p>
<p>

Gratuitious assignments can be revoked by the assignor at anytime unless they become irrevocable. </p>
<p>

G. Liability of Promisee / Assignors</p>
<p>

1. Promisee / Assignors are NOT LIABLE to Gratuitious Assignees</p>
<p>

Promisee/Assignors have no legal liability to gratuitious assignees. Gratuitious assignments are merely "gift promises" that create no legal liability.</p>
<p>

2. Promisee / Assignors are LIABLE to Contractual Assignees</p>
<p>

Promisee /assignors are legally liable to contractual assignees under terms of the "assignment contract" that forms between them for five implied covenants.</p>
<p>

3. Promisor / Assignors remain LIABLE to Promisors</p>
<p>

When contract are assigned promisee / assignors remain legally liable to promisors whether the assignment is a "gift promise" or contractual promise.</p>
<p>

H. Promisors are liable to All Assignees</p>
<p>

Promisors are liable to all assignees whether they are gratuitious or contractual assignees, to the extent they would have been liable to the promisee / assignor before the asssignment.</p>
<p>

I. Defenses of Promisors</p>
<p>

Assignees "step into the shoes" of the promisee so promisors can raise any defense against assignees that could have been claimed by promisors against promisees if the contract had not been assigned. at the moment the promisor was given notice of the assignment.
</p>
<p>
Exception is in Holder in due course.</p>
<p>

J. Defense of Promisee/Assignors</p>
<p>

Any defense promisee/assignors could have raised against the promisors under the master contract can be raised against both promisors and assignees. In addition, promisor / assignors may have other defenses against contractual assignees under the terms of assginment contracts.
</p>
<p>
1. Master contract defenses of Promisees/Assignors
</p>
<p>
Promisee/Assignors retain all defenses available to them under "master contracts", and can raise them against both promisors and contractual assignees.</p>
<p>

2. Assignment contract defenses of Promisee / Assignors</p>
<p>

Promisee/assignors can raise additional defenses against assignees under the terms of "assignment contracts".
</p>
<p>
K. Payments by Mistake to Promisee/Assignor after assignment</p>
<p>

If promisor pays a promisee/assignor after receiving notice of an assignment the promisor is still liable to the assignee. The promisor has the burden of recovering from the promisee / assignor that was paid by mistake.</p>
