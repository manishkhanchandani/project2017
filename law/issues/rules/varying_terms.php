<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under UCC 2-207 an acceptance that includes varying terms is still effective. If the contract is between merchants the varying term proposed by the offeree may become part of the contract if the offer did not <strong>expressly require acceptance</strong> according to its terms, the<strong> offeror does not object </strong>to the varying terms within a <strong>reasonable time</strong>, and the varying terms are <strong>not a material alteration</strong> of the offer term.</p>
<p>If the acceptance is <strong>expressly conditioned on the varying terms</strong> by the offeree, the response is effectively a <strong>rejection</strong> and <strong>counter-offer</strong>. Otherwise the varying terms are considered only "<strong>proposed modifications</strong>".</p>
<p>Even when varying terms do not automatically become part of the contract they may become part of the contract by agreement, and the UCC allows modification without additional consideration.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Example 1</strong></p>
<p>Here Sellco <strong>did not promise to ship in response to Buyco's offer</strong> because it said it "could provide" and not that it "would" provide the product. The word "could" does not imply any "promise to ship". Therefore the <strong>response of Sellco was a rejection of Buyco's offer </strong>and a<strong> counter - offer to sell on different terms</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer</strong></p>
<p>Here the parties are (not) both merchants because... </p>
<p>And the acceptance cited varying terms because... </p>
<p>Further, the varying terms did (not) materially alter the contract because ... </p>
<p>Therefore ...</p>
