<p>Under tort law <strong>PUBLIC DISCLOSURE</strong> is the <strong>unreasonable public disclosure</strong> of <strong>private facts </strong>that a reasonable person would find <strong>embarrassing</strong>.    </p>
<p>Here there was a <strong>public disclosure</strong> because D "ran the interview" in its publication. (or facts from hypo). And the facts <strong>were private facts</strong> because they were told to the ex-boyfriend in "strictest confidence." (or facts from hypo). These were <strong>embarrassing facts</strong> because they concerned an "abortion", a matter of personal intimacy, and of a nature likely to cause public disdain and ridicule. (or facts from hypo). P would argue D acted in an <strong>unreasonable manner</strong>.
    
    
    
    D would argue that it <strong>acted reasonably</strong> because these facts were a matter of legitimate public concern since P had injected herself into the public arena as a "strong and vocal anti- abortion advocate." (or facts from hypo). D would argue the public had a right to know P's true background since she sought to influence public opinion on this controversial topic. (or facts from hypo).    </p>
<p>Therefore, P might fail/pass to show D acted <strong>unreasonably</strong>.</p>
