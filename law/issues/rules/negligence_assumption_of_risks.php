<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete <strong>bar to recovery</strong> for negligence if 1) plaintiffs <strong>deliberately</strong> put themselves at <strong>risk</strong> 2) with<strong> full awareness</strong> of the risks and 3) a <strong>conscious acceptance </strong>of the risks. </p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Here P put <strong>herself at risk</strong> because she &quot;sat carelessly&quot;. She had a <strong>full awareness of the risks</strong> that she could fall. And she appears to have <strong>consciously accepted</strong> those risks because the river was only a few &quot;feet&quot; below her, &quot;she could swim&quot; and it was a &quot;nice day&quot;.</p>
<p>

Therefore D may be able to prove assumption of the risks.</p>
