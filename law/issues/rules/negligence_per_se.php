<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under the tort law a <strong>DUTY</strong> may be created by a <strong>STATUTE</strong> (or rule), and violation of the statute is a <strong>BREACH</strong> of duty making the defendant <strong>NEGLIGENT PER SE</strong> if the purpose of the statute was 1) to protect the <strong>CLASS OF PEOPLE</strong> to which <strong>plaintiff belongs</strong> by 2) preventing the <strong>TYPE OF INJURY</strong> that the<strong> plaintiff suffered</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Here D violated the law that prohibited <u>fireworks in the National Forest</u>, (put facts from hypo) and that caused P to suffer <strong>injury</strong>. But she was not in the <strong>CLASS OF PEOPLE</strong> the statute was <strong>intended </strong>to protect because it was to protect people "<u>on national lands</u>" (put facts from hypo) and she was "<u>outside the National Forest boundaries</u>" (put facts from hypo) . Further, she did not suffer the <strong>TYPE OF INJURY</strong> the statute was<strong> intended to prevent</strong> because it was to "<u>prevent forest fires and injury</u>" (put facts from hypo)  while her injury was <u>getting wet and having her money stolen</u>. (put facts from hypo) </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, P would be able / unable to prove D was negligent per se.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis 2</strong></p>
<p>D might argue P was <strong>NEGLIGENT PER SE</strong> because she was fishing on the bridge where that is <strong>prohibited by statute</strong>. But P <strong>did not suffer</strong> the <strong>TYPE OF INJURY </strong>the statute was to prevent. The<strong> purpose of the statute</strong> was &quot;<strong>traffic safety</strong>&quot; and she <strong>was not injured</strong> in a traffic accident.</p>
<p>

Therefore any &quot;negligence per se&quot; argument by D would fail.</p>
