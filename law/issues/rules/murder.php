<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p><strong>Homicide</strong></p>
<p>Homicide is the <strong>killing</strong> of one human being by another.</p>
<p><strong>Actual Cause</strong></p>
<p>Actual Cause is used by &quot;but for&quot; test. <strong>But for</strong> the act of the defendant, the result would have not occured.</p>
<p><strong>Proximate Cause </strong></p>
<p>Proximate cause is the direct and natural result of the act of defendant.</p>
<p><strong>Murder</strong></p>
<p>Under <strong>CRIMINAL LAW</strong> a <strong>MURDER</strong> is an unlawful <strong>HOMICIDE</strong>, the <strong>killing</strong> of one human being by another, with <strong>MALICE aforethought</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>MALICE</strong> for murder may be </p>
<p>1) an express <strong>INTENT TO KILL</strong>, </p>
<p>or implied by 2) intent to commit <strong>GREAT BODILY INJURY</strong>, </p>
<p>3) a homicide caused by commission of an <strong>INHERENTLY DANGEROUS FELONY</strong>, the &quot;<strong>FELONY MURDER RULE</strong>&quot; or</p>
<p>4) <strong>DELIBERATE CREATION OF EXTREME RISKS</strong> to human life (actus reus) with <strong>AWARENESS</strong> of the risks and a <strong>CONSCIOUS DISREGARD</strong> for them (mens rea), the <strong>&quot;DEPRAVED HEART&quot; </strong>murder.</p>
<p>Under <strong>COMMON LAW</strong> there were <strong>NO DEGREES</strong> of murder but <strong>MODERNLY</strong> first degree murder is generally codified as a</p>
<p>1) <strong>willful</strong>, <strong>deliberate</strong> and <strong>premeditated</strong> homicide or one</p>
<p>2) done by <strong>enumerated means</strong>, e.g. torture, poison and explosives.</p>
<p>3) caused by commission of an <strong>enumerated felony</strong>.</p>
<p>All other murders are in the second degree.</p>
<p><strong>Felony Murder</strong> (<strong>BARRKS</strong> - Burglary, arson, rape, robbery, kidnapping, sodomy) </p>
<p>Murder may be charged under the <strong>FELONY-MURDER RULE</strong> if a death is caused by the commission of an<strong> inherently dangerous felony</strong>, but only if the death is caused by acts done during the <strong>RES GESTAE</strong> of the underlying felony. The RES GESTAE of a crime is the sequence of events from the first <strong>substantial step</strong> to committing the crime and ending when the <strong>defendants leave the scene</strong> of the crime and reach a place of a relative safety. </p>
<p><strong>Four Versions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Common Law: </strong>If anyone is killed during felony, it is felony murder rule. </p>
<p><strong>2. Redline:</strong> Killing of accomplice by other than accomplice like police or innocent person. (no felony murder) </p>
<p><strong>3. California:</strong>  Police is chasing a person from robbery, and that person driving recklessly and hit somebody, (its a wanton conduct)</p>
<p><strong>4. MPC</strong>: intent to kill but killed other, (need to check again) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Excuses</strong> are Infancy (see defense of Infancy) and Insanity (given below) </p>
<p><strong>INSANITY </strong><br />
Generally comes in murder case</p>
<p>Under criminal law INSANITY is a defense that negates criminal intent. Under the <strong>M'NAUGHTEN RULE</strong> a person is insane if a <strong>disease of the mind</strong> so impairs their reasoning that they are <strong>unable to appreciate </strong>the nature and quality of their acts or to<strong> know that they are wrong</strong>. Under the <strong>IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE </strong>theory a person may raise the defense of insanity if they are unable to control their acts, even if they know the act is wrong.</p>
<p>Two others are: Durham and MPC</p>
<p><strong>Durham: </strong>what person does is product of disease or defect.</p>
<p><strong>MPC: </strong>combines first two and softens the body, as a result of mental disease, person does not fully appreciate the wrongfulness of what they are doing, man lacks substantial capacity to control their conduct. </p>
<p>Here Killer could not plead M'Naughten because &quot;he knew it was wrong&quot;<br />
    or<br />
    Here Killer could plead M'Naughten because &quot;he does not know it was wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>But Killer could plead an <strong>irresistible impulse</strong> because &quot;he had an overwhelming phobia&quot; and &quot;he could not help himself&quot;.</p>
<p>Therefore, Killer might be successful with an insanity defense.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong></p>
<p>Public Authority</p>
<p>Previliges: Self defense, def of others, prevention of crime </p>
<p><strong>Mitigation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imperfect Self Defense</strong></p>
<p><strong>Head of Passion:</strong> a. Provoked (obj &amp; subj), time (obj &amp; subj), objective is reasonable person, subjective is this person. </p>
<p>Diminished Capacity: </p>
<p>&nbsp;	 </p>
<p><strong>Conspiracy &amp; Murder </strong></p>
<p>If we have two people and one of them doing the crime then read below:</p>
<p>Criminal B could only be charged with this murder (crime) based on a <strong>vicarious liability</strong> theory.</p>
<p>There are two vicarious liability theories:<br />
    A. Conspiracy Theory and<br />
    B. Accomplice Theory</p>
<p><strong>A. CONSPIRACY THEORY</strong><br />
    A person may be charged with vicarious liability for a crime based on CONSPIRACY THEORY if while they are member of a conspiracy, a co-conspirator commits the crime within the scope of the conspiracy. But a conspiracy ends when the criminal goal is ATTAINED or ABANDONED.</p>
<p>Here Dick was a member of a conspiracy to rob the store, but that conspiracy goal was abandoned when they found the store closed. Since the conspiracy had ended, Tom did not kill the Victor the next day &quot;within the scope&quot; of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>Therefore Dick cannot be charged on this basis.</p>
<p><strong>B. ACCOMPLICE THEORY</strong><br />
    A person who commits or helps commit a crime is liable for all subsequent crimes by co-felons that are a direct and natural result of the prior crimes.</p>
<p>Here Dick helped Tom to rob the store the prior day, so he would be liable for any crimes by Tom that are a direct and natural result of the attempted robbery. But the murder of Victor was not a foreseeable result of the prior robbery attempt.</p>
<p>Therefore Dick cannot be charged with Victor's death based on accomplice liability.</p>
<p>Since Dick had no direct liability or vicarious liability he cannot be charged with Murder.</p>

<p><strong>A. FELONY MURDER example:</strong></p>
<p>Here there was an <strong>unlawful homicide</strong> because KilledPerson was a human being and he was killed by Killer, another human being without legal justification. And it was caused by commission of an<strong> inherently dangerous felony ROBBERY</strong> (or put name of crime), a larceny from the person by force or fear. Killer was taking personal property of another with intent to <strong>permanently deprive</strong> because she was taking &quot;dynamite&quot; (put name of thing which she was stealing) from Killedperson, and she was using force or fear to <strong>overcome his will to resist</strong> because she used a &quot;gun&quot;. The death of Killedperson occured within the <strong>RES GESTAE</strong> of the robbery because he was shot before she left the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Therefore Killer can be charged with murder for killing Killedperson during the robbery. This would be FIRST DEGREE MURDER because robbery is typically one of the &quot;eneumerated felonies&quot; for the first degree murder.</p>
<p><strong>B. GREAT BODILY INJURY (+others combined)</strong></p>
<p>Here there was an <strong>unlawful homicide</strong> because KilledPerson was a human being and he was killed by Killer, another human being without legal justification. </p>
<p>Here Killer appears to have acted with an <strong>express intent to kill</strong> because she shot KilledPerson in the &quot;head&quot; with a &quot;gun&quot;. These facts imply an intent to kill. Alternatively, Killer clearly intended <strong>great bodily injury</strong> because the homicide was caused by a &quot;firearm&quot;. Use of a firearm implies intent to cause serious bodily harm, regardless of where the victim is shot.</p>
<p>Killer also appears to have acted with an <strong>awareness</strong> and <strong>conscious disregard for danger to human life</strong> because she deliberately shot Killedperson in the head for little good reason. Her act created extreme risks to Ruby, she apparently had an awareness of the risks and consiously disregarded them.</p>
<p>Based on above theories, Killer could be charged with the murder of Killedperson.</p>
<p>It appears Killer killed killedperson willfully and deliberately. If that is proven the murder was FIRST DEGREE. Killer might argue that she did not act willfully and deliberately to kill killedperson and only reacted instinctively because she had a &quot;short fuse&quot;, a MITIGATING FACTOR that caused her to suffer from imparied capacity.</p>
<p>If killer can convince the jury she acted instinctively and did not act willfully, deliberately and with premeditation the murder might be reduced to SECOND DEGREE.</p>
<p><strong>C. FIRST DEGREE MURDER EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>Here killer had an <strong>express intent to kill</strong> because she &quot;decided to kill killedperson&quot;. Further, this killing was <strong>willful, deliberate and premediated</strong> because it was planned in advance. Further, this killing was done by <strong>bombing the killedperson</strong> because killer bought dynamite from store and detonate the dynamite under the car of the killed person.</p>
<p>So killer can be charged with FIRST DEGREE MURDER.</p>
<p><strong>D. DEPRAVED HEART THEORY example</strong></p>
<p>Here there was <strong>homicide</strong> because Killedperson was a human being killed by Killer, another human being. Killer may have an <strong>express intent to kill</strong> because she &quot;knew the blast would probably kill killedperson&quot;. But killer would argue that she did not want to kill killedperson because &quot;she felt bad about it.&quot; Regardless, killer deliberately <strong>created extreme risks to human life </strong>with <strong>awareness</strong> of and <strong>conscious disregard</strong> because she &quot;knew the blast would probably kill Killedperson&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore, Killer could be charged with murder based on Depraved Heart Theory of malice.</p>
<p>Further, this would generally be <strong>FIRST DEGREE</strong> murder because the use of explosives to murder is generally one of the &quot;enumerated means&quot; for first degree murder.</p>
<p>Therefore, killer can probably be charged with FIRST DEGREE murder of killedperson even if she did not willfully and deliberately cause his deth with premeditation. She has no defenses.</p>
