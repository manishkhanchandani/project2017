<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law a <strong>BREACH</strong> is the <strong>failure</strong> to exercise DUE CARE. The <strong>standard of due care</strong> is that level of caution a <strong>reasonably prudent person </strong>would use in the same circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>Breach is brought using following methods:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Negligence Per Se</li>
    <li>Res Ipsa Loquitur</li>
    <li>Violation of Standard Profession/Skills</li>
    <li>Balance Test (Learned Hand Formula)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Balance Test</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Risk
        </strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Likelihood of Injury (x multiply)
                <ol>
                    <li>12 year old can cross the fence easily </li>
                    <li>fence is 6', which can be easily crossed by 12 year old boy</li>
                    <li>Barbed wire, is not very protective</li>
                    <li>12 Signs, which can be ignored by 12 year old boy</li>
                    <li>So it is highly likely that 12 year old boy can cross the wire and get injured.    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Gravity of Injury  
                <ol>
                    <li>Injury of touching the live wire is very high causing grave injury. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Justification</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Burden of Prevention (+ plus)
                <ol>
                    <li>Higher Fence, should have been used</li>
                    <li>More wires, should have been used  </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Social Utility   
                <ol>
                    <li>Utility of pole is need for the community so it cannot be removed but safely kept to keep injury out of the scope. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>If Risk outweighs justification, there is negligence, and if justification outweighs risk, then there is no negligence. So based on above analysis of balance test, risk is more than justification so there is breach. </p>

<p><strong>Important</strong></p>
<p>Using Hand formula and you have to figure out B, P, and L.</p>
<p>B: the burden of taking the precaution &mdash; in this case the working radio &mdash; is $100.</p>
<p>P: The <strong>probability of harm if the precaution is not taken</strong> is 5 percent (or .05), which is multiplied by the <strong>gravity of harm </strong>(L)  if an accident does occur, or $30,000.</p>
<p>Thus, .05 &times; 30,000 = $1,500. Once you compute this figure, and know that the precaution cost is $100.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Here D went to <u>great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone</u> (show care taken by D from hypo) because <u>he went to a "gravel bar" in the "middle of the river" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers &quot;carefully&quot;</u>. (show what D did about taking the care from hypo)</p>
<p>
P could only argue that a reasonably observant person <u>would have seen the &quot;log&quot; floating down the river</u> , and <u>would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers</u> onto it. (tell what reasonable person would do in same situation)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
Therefore, it would be difficult for P to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than D.</p>
<p><strong>More Explanation </strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>BREACH</strong> means that the defendant <strong>did not exercise</strong> the <strong>DEGREE OF CARE</strong> a reasonable person would use in the <strong>same circumstances</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Standard of care for Child: </strong>If the defendant is CHILD engaged in childlike activities , the standard is the level of care a child of that age and experience would normally use. A child engaged in adult activities is held to be an adult standard. </p>
<p>And if the defendant is a<strong> highly trained PROFESSIONAL</strong>, a higher standard of care applies. </p>
<p>But if the defendant is <strong>MENTALLY RETARDED, insane or ignorant</strong>, the standard of care is <strong>NOT LOWERED</strong> below that set for the average member of the community.</p>
<p>Here there was a BREACH because a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have ... </p>
<p>In assessing "reasonableness" the STANDARD OF CARE that would be applied to the defendant is ... </p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>The STANDARD OF CARE for a child is to act in the manner <strong>reasonable children of the same age</strong> and experience <strong>act</strong>.</p>
<p>
Here Dick was only “three years old” and he would <strong>only be negligent</strong> if he acted in a manner that children of that age <strong>do not reasonably act</strong>. (facts from hypo) </p>
<p>
Since Dick was so young it is unlikely P could prove that he breached his duty, if he had a duty.</p>
