<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law a <strong>BREACH</strong> is the <strong>failure</strong> to exercise DUE CARE. The <strong>standard of due care</strong> is that level of caution a <strong>reasonably prudent person </strong>would use in the same circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Here D went to <u>great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone</u> (show care taken by D from hypo) because <u>he went to a "gravel bar" in the "middle of the river" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers &quot;carefully&quot;</u>. (show what D did about taking the care from hypo)</p>
<p>
P could only argue that a reasonably observant person <u>would have seen the &quot;log&quot; floating down the river</u> , and <u>would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers</u> onto it. (tell what reasonable person would do in same situation)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
Therefore, it would be difficult for P to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than D.</p>
<p><strong>More Explanation </strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>BREACH</strong> means that the defendant <strong>did not exercise</strong> the <strong>DEGREE OF CARE</strong> a reasonable person would use in the <strong>same circumstances</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Standard of care for Child: </strong>If the defendant is CHILD engaged in childlike activities , the standard is the level of care a child of that age and experience would normally use. A child engaged in adult activities is held to be an adult standard. </p>
<p>And if the defendant is a<strong> highly trained PROFESSIONAL</strong>, a higher standard of care applies. </p>
<p>But if the defendant is <strong>MENTALLY RETARDED, insane or ignorant</strong>, the standard of care is <strong>NOT LOWERED</strong> below that set for the average member of the community.</p>
<p>Here there was a BREACH because a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have ... </p>
<p>In assessing "reasonableness" the STANDARD OF CARE that would be applied to the defendant is ... </p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p>The STANDARD OF CARE for a child is to act in the manner <strong>reasonable children of the same age</strong> and experience <strong>act</strong>.</p>
<p>
Here Dick was only “three years old” and he would <strong>only be negligent</strong> if he acted in a manner that children of that age <strong>do not reasonably act</strong>. (facts from hypo) </p>
<p>
Since Dick was so young it is unlikely P could prove that he breached his duty, if he had a duty.</p>
