<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong> damages are allowed for <strong>pain and suffering</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rule and Analysis </strong></p>
<p>Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (<strong>out of pocket expense</strong>) and GENERAL (<strong>pain and suffering</strong>).</p>
<p>

Here P had <strong>SPECIAL damages </strong>because <u>she lost "two dollars"</u> (take facts from hypo) and she had <strong>GENERAL damages</strong> because <u>she was "hurt and upset." </u>(take facts from hypo) But she got out of the river “laughingly” and was not “hurt and upset” until after she discovered the purse was stolen. (take facts from hypo) </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>

Therefore P suffered actual damages, but D was not the cause of those damages. </p>
