<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law <strong>PUBLIC NUISANCE</strong> is an <strong>unreasonable interference</strong> with a person's<strong> use and enjoyment </strong>of <strong>public resources</strong>. </p>
<p>To have standing the plaintiff must show particular injury, greater than that suffered by the general public.</p>
<p><strong>My Explanation </strong></p>
<p>Note 1: In determining whether D conduct amounted to a public nuisance, the court will consider these factors: 1) the type of neighborhood, 2) the nature of the act; 3) the proximity of the act to the victims; 4) the frequency, 5) duration, 6) the timing of the act; 7) the extent of the damage that resulted.</p>
<p>Example 1: Farmer (F) was buring weeds on his land, which was adjacent to a public highway. This was a customary practice for formers in the area. The wind was erratic, and from time to time heavy smoke was blown across the highway. This causes accident on highway causing injury to many drivers.</p>
<p>Here there is <strong>unreasonable interference</strong> because F was burning weeds on his land which interferes with the driving on the public highway. Here there was<strong> interference </strong>with <strong>use and enjoyment of public resources</strong> because drivers of car could not use the public highway because of the smoke caused by the Farmer by burning his weeds. Here highway is public resource and use of that in obstructed by the weeds. </p>
<p>Therefore Farmer is liable for public nuisance.  </p>
