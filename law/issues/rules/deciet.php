<p>Under tort law a person is liable for 1) making a <strong>FALSE STATEMENT</strong> OF <strong>MATERIAL FACT</strong> 2)<strong> KNOWING</strong> it was <strong>false</strong> 3) with <strong>INTENT TO DECEIVE</strong>, 4) that was <strong>REASONABLY RELIED</strong> upon by the plaintiff, and thereby 5) <strong>CAUSING</strong> the plaintiff <strong>INJURY</strong>.</p>
<p>Here D made a statement of fact when he said a franchise &quot;would be granted&quot; if the location was suitable, and that was <strong>false</strong> because he had &quot;no intention&quot; of granting P a franchise. He <strong>intended to deceive</strong> because he wanted her to reveal the location, and P<strong> reasonably relied</strong> on his representation because she did reveal the location. (or facts from hypo). That caused <strong>her damages</strong> because D used the information to convince Jack not to lease the &quot;perfect location&quot; to P.

(or facts from hypo). D also <strong>made false statements </strong>when he told P the location was &quot;too small for a franchise.&quot; (or facts from hypo).  He <strong>intended to deceive her</strong> so she would not go through with her lease plans. And she <strong>reasonably relied</strong> on that statement because she &quot;withdrew&quot; her offer to Jack. (or facts from hypo). That caused <strong>her damages</strong> because she otherwise would have secured the lease. (or facts from hypo).</p>
<p>Therefore, P can prove the elements of fraud and D may be liable for the damages she suffered.</p>
