<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>An offer must be accepted before it LAPSES. Unless there is an option, an offer lapses in the time stated or if no time is stated within a <strong>reasonable time </strong>after the offer is made.</p>
<p>Under common law an offer <strong>LAPSES AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED</strong> unless it is accepted in a <strong>reasonable period of time</strong>. Oral offers are deemed to lapse at the <strong>end of the conversation</strong>, and written offers are deemed to lapse within the timeframe implied by the means of dispatch, absent contrary agreement or implication.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Example 1</strong></p>
<p>An offer must be accepted before it LAPSES. Unless there is an option, an offer lapses in the time stated or if no time is stated within a <strong>reasonable time </strong>after the offer is made.</p>
<p>Here the reasonable time for acceptance of Lucy's offer is defined by the understanding that Homer would view the house in only one hour at "10:00". That understanding established the "reasonable time" within which Homer could accept the offer. But Homer was "five hours late," so Lucy's offer had already lapsed when he arrived. Homer's attempt to unequivocally accept Lucy's 9:00 offer by saying "I unequivocally accept" was ineffective because he could not accept an offer that had already lapsed.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Homer's attempt to accept was ineffective.</p>

<p>Here offer cannot be accepted because it off lapses after 10 pm as mentioned above.  </p>
<p>Therefore ...</p>
