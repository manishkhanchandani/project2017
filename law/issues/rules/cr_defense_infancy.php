<p><strong>Defense of Infancy?</strong></p>
<p>Under common law there was a <strong>rebuttable presumption</strong> that a child over the <strong>AGE OF SIX AND UNDER THE AGE OF 14</strong> could NOT form criminal intent.</p>
<p>Here A could raise this defense and argue he<strong> could not form criminal intent</strong> because he was "12 years old". He <strong>could present additional evidence</strong> that he was childish and not fully aware that what he was doing was wrong, but he has <strong>no burden to do that</strong>. Rather, the <strong>presumption favors the child</strong>, so the prosecution <strong>MUST</strong> present additional evidence to rebut the presumption that A is too young to form criminal intent.</p>
