<p>Under tort law a defendant who creates a <strong>perilous situation</strong> is <strong>liable</strong> to all who are accidentally<strong> injured coming to the rescue</strong> (except for professional rescuers; see the FIREMAN'S RULE) even though the rescuers who are injured are not in the ZONE OF DANGER created by the defendant's acts or injured by the dangers created.    </p>
<p><strong>FIREMAN'S RULE:</strong> Under broadly adopted modern statutes defendants who create <strong>dangerous situations</strong> that cause accidental injury to <strong>professional rescuers</strong> like firemen are generally<strong> not liable to them </strong>for negligence under the <strong>RESCUER DOCTRINE</strong>. These statutes are generally based on the view that professional rescuers both <strong>assume the risks </strong>of their professions and are compensated for by insurance plans like the &quot;workman's compensation&quot; program.</p>
