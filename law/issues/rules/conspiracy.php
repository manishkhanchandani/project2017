<p>Under <strong>COMMON LAW</strong>, the crime of <strong>CONSPIRACY</strong> was an <strong>agreement between two or more people</strong> to work toward an <strong>illegal goal</strong>. Modernly an <strong>OVERT ACT</strong> in furtherance of the conspiracy goal is often required in many courts. Conspiracy does not merge with ultimate crime. </p>
<p>Further, under the <strong>PINKERTON'S RULE</strong>, a member of a conspiracy is <strong>VICARIOUSLY LIABLE </strong>for the criminal acts of co-conspirators done <strong>WITHIN THE SCOPE OF</strong> conspiracy goal. This means crimes that were 1) <strong>foreseeable</strong> and 2) in <strong>furtherence</strong> of the <strong>conspiracy goal</strong>. </p>
<p>And under <strong>WHARTON'S RULE</strong>, a conspiracy requires the <strong>participation of more people</strong> than the <strong>minimum number</strong> necessary to commit the criminal act. </p>

<p><strong>Example of Conspiracy</strong></p>
<p>Under common law a <strong>CONSPIRACY</strong> is an <strong>agreement between two or more people</strong> to work toward an <strong>illegal goal</strong>. Modernly an <strong>overt step </strong>toward the criminal goal is often required. Conspiracy does not merge into the ultimate crime.</p>
<p>
Here there was an implied <strong>agreement between Tom and Dick</strong>, two people, for an illegal goal, because they<strong> “burst” into the store</strong> together and “wanted to rob” the store. They committed an<strong> overt step </strong>toward their goal because of this.</p>
<p>

Therefore Tom can be charged with conspiracy. </p>
