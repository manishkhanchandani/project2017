<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law FRAUD is a defense to enforcement of a contract where a party 1) <strong>deliberately misrepresented material facts</strong>, 2) the party raising the defense reasonably <strong>relied on the misrepresentations</strong>, and 3) the party to be bound <strong>would not have entered</strong> into the contract <strong>but for the misrepresentation</strong>.</p>
<p>Under contract law a contract induced through deliberate <strong>CONCEALMENT of material facts</strong> by a party with a duty to reveal the facts, or by a party deliberately concealing and/or <strong>MISREPRESENTING</strong> <strong>material facts</strong> is <strong>unenforceable</strong> if it can be shown the party seeking to void the contract would <strong>never have agreed to the bargain but for the concealment and/or misrepresentation</strong>. </p>

<p>Under contract law FRAUD is a defense to enforcement of a contract where a party 1) <strong>deliberately misrepresented material facts</strong>, 2) the party raising the defense reasonably <strong>relied on the misrepresentations</strong>, and 3) the party to be bound <strong>would not have entered</strong> into the contract <strong>but for the misrepresentation</strong>.</p>
<p>

Here Tom <strong>deliberately misrepresented facts </strong>because he said Al was "19" knowing that Al was a minor. And this was a <strong>material fact</strong> since it represented Al had legal capacity to enter into a contract. And <strong>Decca reasonably relied on Tom's misrepresentation</strong>, and could probably prove it<strong> would not have entered</strong> the contract had it known the truth.</p>
<p>

Therefore, the contract of March 1 was unenforceable against Deccra.</p>
