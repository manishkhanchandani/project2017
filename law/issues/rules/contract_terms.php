<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>If an acceptance forms a contract, for common law say,</p>
<p>

Under common law enforceable contracts generally must indicate PARTIES, PRICE, SUBJECT MATTER, TIME OF PERFORMANCE and QUANTITY. Most express terms and promises are considered to be EXPRESS MATERIAL CONDITIONS, except for TIME of performance, buyer SATISFACTION, and promises NOT TO ASSIGN the contract which are generally considered mere “covenants”.</p>
<p>



If an acceptance forms a contract, for UCC say,</p>
<p>

Under the UCC a contract is enforceable if the QUANTITY and PARTIES are specified. Other terms will be provided by the GAP FILLER provisions of the UCC. All express terms and promises are treated as material terms under the PERFECT TENDER RULE.</p>
<p>



Elements:</p>
<p>

1. CL: Qtips i.e. quantity, time, identity of parties, price, subject matter</p>
<p>

2. UCC: Quantity and Parties</p>
<p>

3. Other terms will be provided by UCC Gap Filler.</p>

<p><strong>What were the TERMS of the bargain? </strong></p>
<p>

Under the UCC the subject matter, quantity and parties must be specified for a contract to be sufficiently certain, but all other terms can be supplied by the UCC’s GAP FILLERS.</p>
<p>

Here the parties are Al and Bob and the subject matter is one tuxedo that is to be "exactly Al's size." Although price was not agreed upon that term would be inferred by the normal price for such goods. If $519.95 was the normal price of the tuxedo, it would be the price supplied by the UCC. The place of delivery was Bob's store and the time of delivery was agreed to be "later in the week."</p>
<p>

Therefore the TERMS of the contract were sufficiently certain for it to be enforced.
</p>



<p>

Therefore the contract is specific enough to be enforced.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TERMS?</strong></p>
<p>
Under UCC Article 2 a goods contract is enforceable if quantity and parties are specified.. All other terms can be supplied by the UCC’s GAP FILLERS.</p>
<p>

Here the parties are specified as Sellco and Buyco. The quantity is 10,000 yellow widgets at a price of $6 without a warranty for delivery on 6/8.</p>
