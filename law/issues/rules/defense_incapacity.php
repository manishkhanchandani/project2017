<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a contract cannot be enforced <strong>AGAINST</strong> one who <strong>lacks capacity</strong>. <strong>EXCEPTIONS</strong> are contracts for provision of <strong>NECESSITIES of life</strong>.</p>
<p>Under contract law a contract, <strong>except</strong> for <strong>necessities of life</strong>, <strong>cannot</strong> be <strong>enforced</strong> at law against a party which <strong>lacked legal capacity</strong> at the time of execution. But if a legal incapacity is <strong>removed</strong> the party to be bound must <strong>repudiate the contract within a reasonable period</strong> of time or they will be <strong>deemed to have affirmed or ratified it</strong>. The period of time in which a party gaining legal capacity must repudiate a contract may be set by statue.</p>
<p>A party lacking capacity can enforce a contract against a party that does not lack capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Sample 1: Enforceable by a MINOR?</strong></p>
<p>Under contract law a contract, <strong>except</strong> for <strong>necessities of life</strong>, <strong>cannot</strong> be <strong>enforced</strong> at law against a party which <strong>lacked legal capacity</strong> at the time of execution. But if a legal incapacity is <strong>removed</strong> the party to be bound must <strong>repudiate the contract within a reasonable period</strong> of time or they will be <strong>deemed to have affirmed or ratified it</strong>. The period of time in which a party gaining legal capacity must repudiate a contract may be set by statue.</p>
<p>Here <strong>Al lacked capacity at the time of execution</strong> because it was &quot;two days before his seventeenth birthday&quot;. But that does not prevent Al from enforcing the contract against Tom who did not lack capacity.</p>
<p>
Therefore the contract is enforceable by Al, even though he is a minor.</p>

<p><strong>Sample 2: Was the contract of April 1 enforceable by Deccra against Al? 6) EFFECTIVE REPUDIATION OF CONTRACT?</strong></p>
<p>As explained above a contract, <strong>except for necessities of life</strong>, cannot be enforced against a party lacking legal capacity at the time of execution. But if a <strong>party lacking capacity</strong> at the time of contract gains capacity, they <strong>must affirmatively repudiate the contract within a reasonable period



of time</strong>, or within the time set by statute, or they will be deemed to have affirmed or ratified the

contract.</p>
<p>

Here Al lacked capacity to contract at the time of execution because he was a minor who was "only 17".</p>
<p>

Al later<strong> attempted to repudiate the contract</strong> "six months after becoming an adult." He would argue that this was within a &quot;reasonable&quot; time after he gained capacity. And if this was within the statutory time period the repudiation was effective. Otherwise the contract may have been deemed automatically affirmed and the repudiation would be ineffective.</p>
<p>

If the<strong> repudiation was effective</strong>, Decca would generally be required to give to Al all money it had made on the sale of his song.</p>
<p>

Therefore, Deccra cannot enforce the contract if Al's repudiation was effective.</p>
