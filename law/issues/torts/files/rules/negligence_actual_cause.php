<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>
<p>Under tort law the defendant is the <strong>ACTUAL CAUSE</strong> of injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured <strong>BUT FOR</strong> the acts of the defendant. </p>
<p>If <strong>two</strong> or more defendants acted negligently, the plaintiff would <strong>not</strong> have been <strong>injured</strong> if <strong>neither</strong> had <strong>acted</strong>, and the plaintiff <strong>cannot</strong> reasonably <strong>prove</strong> she would not have been injured but for the <strong>acts of each alone</strong>, then each defendant is a <strong>SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR</strong> causing injury.</p>
