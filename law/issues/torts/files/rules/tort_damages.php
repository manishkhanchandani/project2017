<p>Every defendant that commits any tort is liable for all actual damages actually and proximately caused. Damages consist of <strong>SPECIAL DAMAGES</strong>, compensation for <strong>monetary losses</strong>, and <strong>GENERAL DAMAGES</strong>, compensation for <strong>pain, suffering</strong>, anxiety, emotional distress, inconvenience, etc. Defendants who commit <strong>intentional torts</strong>, including gross negligence (deliberate breach of duty) and recklessness (deliberate creation of unreasonable risks) may also be <strong>liable</strong> for <strong>PUNITIVE DAMAGES</strong> if the Court finds they acted with FRAUD, OPPRESSION or MALICE, an evil or wrongful intent to cause harm. Defendants who commit <strong>accidental negligent torts </strong>are<strong> not liable</strong> for <strong>punitive</strong> damages. Tort plaintiffs have a right to &quot;<strong>waive the tort</strong>&quot;and demand <strong>RESTITUTION</strong> instead of compensation for damages. </p>
