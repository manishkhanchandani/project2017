  <p>Why would at least two Nobel Prize winning scientists risk their careers and reputations and publicly state that HIV doesn&#8217;t cause AIDS? Why would one of the world&#8217;s foremost virologists risk his career and reputation and also publicly state that HIV doesn&#8217;t cause AIDS? And why is Magic Johnson still alive?</p>
  <p>It turns out that the HIV=AIDS hypothesis is one of the biggest blunders in medical science of our time. I&#8217;m confident that future civilizations will look back at us in disgust as they wonder not only how it was that a few people could be so selfish to perpetuate such lies that would lead to the death of millions of others while they benefitted financially, but also how it is that these people were allowed to do this by the rest of the population. This will probably be very similar to how we look back today at civilizations from hundreds of years ago that believed that the Earth is flat and condemned those who would even dare to say that the Earth is in fact round. Consider how <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> was convicted of heresy for standing behind Copernicus&#8217;s theories that the Sun was the center of our solar system and not the Earth. In fact Copernicus refused to publish his work for many years because he <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">didn&#8217;t want to risk the scorn</a> &#8220;to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses.&#8221;</p>
  <p>It seems that not a lot has changed since the days of Copernicus, because today even leading scientists who have already contributed a lot to our development, can still be ridiculed and condemned for expressing their views. And this while thousands and perhaps even millions of people die around the world who could otherwise be saved.</p>
  <p>A multi-billion dollar industry now exists around the HIV=AIDS hypothesis and those who benefit from this aren&#8217;t willing to tell the truth and give up their lucrative business. The first HIV test is patented and owned by the US and French governments who have invested a lot in this scam. Scientists are bought by the industry with research grants that help to perpetuate the lies on which this industry is founded. The scientists who aren&#8217;t willing to go along and want to speak the truth are condemned, ridiculed, suppressed, marginalized, are called <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_denialism">AIDS denialists</a>, and lose their funding.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Take microbiologist <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_Mullis">Dr. Kary Mullis Ph.D.</a> for example, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his invention called the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technique, <strong>which ironically allowed scientists to analyze human tissue for the presence of HIV</strong>. When he expressed his views about HIV not causing AIDS, and not being able to find ANY evidence for this, all of a sudden his scientific views didn&#8217;t count anymore. Scientists backed by the AIDS industry are perfectly OK with using Mullis&#8217;s PCR technique to look for HIV in humans though, but anything he says that threatens their AIDS empire gets ignored. This isn&#8217;t unique in the medical scientific community as you can find this kind of behavior in many other areas in scientific research and even in other industries. For example, not too long ago <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.kareldonk.com/understanding-women-part-ii/">I discussed</a> how the true causes of hysteria among women in the 1800s were suppressed by physicians because they feared the consequences of being politically incorrect and losing business:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It's important to note that those physicians knew exactly what was going on. They knew the cause of the symptoms that the women they were treating were suffering from, namely, sexual dissatisfaction. It's also important to note that those women apparently had no idea what the causes were of the symptoms they were experiencing, because otherwise they'd probably know what to do and not need the physicians. But the physicians kept quiet about the cause because they were more interested in making money than doing society a favor by telling everyone exactly what was going on.</p>
    <p>[&#8230;], instead they wanted to benefit financially from the psychological issues women were having and looked for better ways to be able to treat these women themselves. The money isn't in the cure, but in the treatment (you'll come across this more once you start investigating issues in the healthcare industry today).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Important scientific discoveries are often held back by the few in order to protect their financial interests, even at the expense of the vast majority of the global population.</p>
  <p>In a foreword to the book &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Inventing-AIDS-Virus-Peter-Duesberg/dp/0895263998">Inventing the AIDS Virus</a>&#8221; by Dr. Peter Duesberg Ph.D., Mullis <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161026203553/http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html">had the following to say</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In 1988 I was working as a consultant at Specialty Labs in Santa Monica, CA, setting up analytic routines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). I knew a lot about setting up analytic routines for anything with nucleic acids in it because I invented the Polymerase Chain Reaction. That&#8217;s why they hired me.</p>
    <p>Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, was something I did not know a lot about. Thus, when I found myself writing a report on our progress and goals for the project, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, I recognized that I did not know the scientific reference to support a statement I had just written: &#8220;HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.&#8221;</p>
    <p>So I turned to the virologist at the next desk, a reliable and competent fellow, and asked him for the reference. He said I didn&#8217;t need one. I disagreed. While it&#8217;s true that certain scientific discoveries or techniques are so well established that their sources are no longer referenced in the contemporary literature, that didn&#8217;t seem to be the case with the HIV/AIDS connection. It was totally remarkable to me that the individual who had discovered the cause of a deadly and as-yet-uncured disease would not be continually referenced in the scientific papers until that disease was cured and forgotten.</p>
    <p>&#8230;</p>
    <p>After ten or fifteen meetings over a couple years, I was getting pretty upset when no one could cite the reference. I didn&#8217;t like the ugly conclusion that was forming in my mind: <strong>The entire campaign against a disease increasingly regarded as a twentieth century Black Plague was based on a hypothesis whose origins no one could recall. That defied both scientific and common sense.</strong></p>
    <p>&#8230;</p>
    <p><strong>We have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called AZT (Zidovudine) to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood. In fact, we cannot understand why humans would take this drug for any reason.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Listen to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IifgAvXU3ts">interview below</a> where Dr. Mullis talks about what&#8217;s wrong with the HIV=AIDS hypothesis.</p>
  <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;">
    <iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IifgAvXU3ts?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
  </span></p>
  <p>Along with Dr. Mullis, another Nobel Prize in Chemistry winning scientist, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gilbert">Dr. Walter Gilbert</a>, also <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Walter_Gilbert">stated that HIV is not the cause of AIDS</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[Duesberg] is absolutely correct in saying that no one has proven that AIDS is caused by the AIDS virus. And he is absolutely correct that the virus cultured in the laboratory may not be the cause of AIDS. Hippocrates (Sept./Oct. 1988)</p>
    <p>I would not be surprised if there were another cause of AIDS and even that HIV is not involved. As quoted in Omni (June 1993)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And from <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160520111452/http://www.duesberg.com:80/articles/kmreason.html">here</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Leading biochemical scientists, including University of California at Berkeley retrovirus expert Peter Duesberg and Nobel Prize winner Walter Gilbert, have been warning for years that there is no proof that HIV causes AIDS. [&#8230;] Viewers of ABC&#8217;s 1993 Day One special on the cause of AIDS-almost the only occasion on which network television has covered the controversy-<strong>saw Robert Gallo, the leading exponent of the HIV theory, stomp away from the microphone in a rage when asked to respond to the views of Gilbert and Duesberg</strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Speaking of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.duesberg.com">Dr. Peter Duesberg Ph.D.</a>, he&#8217;s a world renowned virologist who was the co-discoverer of the first viral cancer gene and also became famous for being the first to map the genetic structure of retroviruses. He publicly began speaking out about HIV not being the cause of AIDS about 3 years after Gallo announced it was at a press conference. Similar to Dr. Mullis, as soon as Duesberg began expressing his findings that opposed the lies being perpetuated by the AIDS industry, all of a sudden his views didn&#8217;t matter anymore. He was viewed as a threat to the AIDS establishment and was marginalized. Apparently <strong>being the first to map the genetic structure of retroviruses</strong> doesn&#8217;t give your scientific views any weight when you say that HIV &#8212; <strong>which is a retrovirus</strong> &#8212; doesn&#8217;t cause AIDS. Duesberg&#8217;s views on the HIV=AIDS hypothesis are explored in great detail in the documentary linked below titled &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTxvmKHYajQ">HIV=AIDS: Fact or Fraud</a>.&#8221; I highly recommend watching it.</p>
  <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;">
    <iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTxvmKHYajQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
  </span></p>
  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.duesberg.com">Duesberg&#8217;s website</a> has a wealth of information on the HIV=AIDS fraud as well as a lot of research proving the HIV=AIDS hypothesis is a fraud. Duesberg&#8217;s research shows that HIV is a harmless retrovirus that has lived in humans for centuries without causing any disease. It also shows that the cause of AIDS can be linked to lifestyle/behavioral issues, drug abuse and malnutrition, which, when you think about it makes a ton of sense. Abuse of recreational drugs is bound to have serious negative consequences for your body, and especially your immune system. Similarly, not having access to healthy food, as the case is in African countries, also weakens your body and immune system.</p>
  <p>The HIV=AIDS hypothesis also doesn&#8217;t agree with the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease">germ theory of disease</a>. This is explained in the above linked documentary titled &#8220;HIV=AIDS: Fact or Fraud&#8221;, but in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbhNDBZbecw">below video</a> you can also watch a presentation by Duesberg on this subject:</p>
  <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;">
    <iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbhNDBZbecw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
  </span></p>
  <p>The fact that HIV doesn&#8217;t cause AIDS is further evidenced by the fact that there are many people who are born with, or develop, disorders in their immune systems who develop AIDS-like symptoms but aren&#8217;t infected with HIV. The AIDS industry conveniently calls this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.autoimmune.com/Non-HIVAIDSGen.html">Non-HIV AIDS</a> and pretends that the HIV virus does cause AIDS but is just not detectable in these people for some reason:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia, or ICL, is an immunodeficiency syndrome in which human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, cannot be detected. Because HIV is the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), ICL can be referred to as Non-HIV AIDS. As in AIDS patients, Non-HIV AIDS patients exhibit reduced numbers of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, and many Non-HIV AIDS patients have developed the opportunistic infections or otherwise rare cancers associated with AIDS.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you just laughed out loud at the absurdity of this, I completely understand. Apparently there are a lot of people out there who suffer from Non-HIV AIDS, just take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ukprogressive.co.uk/the-aids-like-disease-seldom-mentioned/article20891.html">this</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Why isn't CFS/ME a reportable disease overseen by our public health department? Why are ME and CFS (i.e., the same exact disorder) suspiciously categorized as two separate illnesses on a worldwide level (i.e., by ICD codes)? Doesn't anyone else but me, very clearly see, the catastrophic cover-up going on here?</p>
    <p><strong>Why are we not reading about Non-HIV AIDS cases (and/or the AIDS-like nature of CFS) on the front pages of every newspaper in the world?</strong> And if CFS/ME is Non-HIV AIDS, then, depending on who you believe, there are anywhere between 500,000 – 14,000,000 Americans out there with a transmissible illness. If that is what it truly is, our new form of AIDS dwarfs the 'original' AIDS epidemic — tenfold!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We&#8217;re not reading about these Non-HIV AIDS cases <strong>because it&#8217;s against the interests of the AIDS industry <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who want to sell their drugs to people</span></strong>. This is exactly what Duesberg&#8217;s research showed &#8212; that HIV couldn&#8217;t be the cause of AIDS because many people were suffering from AIDS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but didn&#8217;t have the HIV virus in them</span>! Instead of doing the logical thing and looking for another cause of AIDS, the AIDS establishment just went ahead and said, &#8220;No, no, HIV is the cause of AIDS, but it&#8217;s just not detectable in those people.&#8221; It&#8217;s hilarious and sad at the same time. Just imagine that because of the fraud committed by these people there are millions of people around the world who are dying because of toxic drugs that they&#8217;re sold to fight a harmless HIV virus &#8212; <strong>drugs which themselves cause AIDS!</strong></p>
  <p>It&#8217;s a self-fulfilling prophecy: Tell perfectly healthy people with HIV that they&#8217;re going to die from AIDS, even though HIV doesn&#8217;t cause AIDS, and then sell them drugs that actually cause AIDS so they get sick and die anyway. Like I mentioned before, the money isn&#8217;t in the cure but in the treatment. The big pharmaceutical companies benefitting from this mess are happy to keep you coming to buy their poison. <strong>Indeed it appears that whatever you do, if you are found to be HIV positive, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DO NOT use any medication against HIV if you want to live and not get AIDS</span>.</strong></p>
  <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;">
    <iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jw_PJPqVk0o?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
  </span></p>
  <p>If HIV was really as dangerous as these people claim, and if people infected with HIV have only 10 years to live, then why are there many people who continue to live longer and die a natural death? Just look at <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>, who was found to be HIV positive in 1991. At the time of this writing, 21 years have gone by and Mr. Johnson is still alive. Shouldn&#8217;t he have died already because of AIDS? Perhaps the reason why Johnson is still alive is due to the fact that he partnered with the AIDS industry and became an important spokesperson for them while advertising the use of certain drugs against AIDS, possibly putting him high enough in the chain and making him valuable enough to be allowed to know the truth about HIV not causing AIDS &#8212; and as a result not using the toxic drugs himself.</p>
  <p>If HIV was really as dangerous as these people claim, then why would Dr. Robert Willner inject himself numerous times with HIV in front of the press? Just take a look at one of his presentations in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQCKb1JV-4A">the video below</a> and listen carefully to what he has to say:</p>
  <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;">
    <iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQCKb1JV-4A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
  </span></p>
  <p>What&#8217;s taking place here right before our eyes is a tragedy on a global scale. A tragedy where millions of people are purposely and knowingly murdered by the AIDS industry, including the big pharmaceutical companies, in order to benefit from it financially. In the midst of this we fortunately have people like Dr. Mullis and Dr. Duesberg with a lot of courage, who are willing to risk their careers and reputation to fight this corrupt system. I hope future generations will recognize these men, and all others like them, as the heroes that they are. I have a lot of admiration and respect for them.</p>
  <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;">

  </span></p>
  <p>I hope that after reading this, watching the linked videos and doing some of your own research, you will act on your conscience and openly talk about the truth to everyone. Consider that this information could one day save the life of a friend, a loved one or even a family member, who might otherwise trust the wrong people and suffer and maybe even die because of totally unnecessary reasons.</p>
