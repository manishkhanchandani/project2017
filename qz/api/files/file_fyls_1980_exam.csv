"1. Carl and Homer entered into a valid written contract under which Carl agreed to build a house on Homer's lot. Homer agreed to pay $150,000 for the house. The contract stated: ""Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.""

Assume that shortly after commencing performance Carl called Homer and said that the 1/2 inch rods for the foundation required in the specifications were in short supply, but that 1/4 inch rods were readily available. Homer replied: ""Go ahead and use the 1/4 th inch."" One day later, before Carl had bought or installed the rods, Homer called and stated that Carl Must use the 1/2 inch rods. Carl refused to do so. 

The best analysis of the parties legal rights is:",multiple-choice,"Homer waived his right to have 1/2 inch steel and his waiver cannot be retracted.","Homer and Carl modified their contract and Carl may use 1/4 inch rods.","Homer waived his right to have 1/2 inch rods, but he has retracted the waiver so that Carl must use 1/2 inch rods.","Homer's statement, ""Go ahead and use the 1/4 inch,"" is not effective either as a modification or a waiver because Homer did not expressly agree to modify or waive.",,,3,,Contracts
"2. Carl and Homer entered into a valid written contract under which Carl agreed to build a house on Homer's lot. Homer agreed to pay $150,000 for the house. The contract stated: ""Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.""

Assume that during his vacation, Homer voluntarily spent two days helping Carl construct the house. At the end of the second day, Carl mentioned the fact that he had an antique weathervane and Homer said he would like to buy it. Carl stated:  ""You 've already done enough for me. I'll give the weathervane to you and install it tomorrow."" Homer said: ""Thanks a lot."" When Carl refused to deliver or install the weathervane, Homer sued.

The principal question for the court is whether",multiple-choice,"Homer's voluntary work was sufficient consideration for Carl's promise to give Homer the weathervane.","Carl's statement about the weathervane is enforceable as an oral modification of a written contract.","the parole evidence rules bars admission of evidence of the promise to give Homer the weathervane.","Carl's statement about the weathervane constituted a promise.",,,1,,Contracts

The contract stated: ""Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.""

Assume that neither the written agreement nor the specifications mentioned the size of water heater to be installed. Carl installed a 20 gallon heater. The size of the house reasonably required one of at least 40 gallons. After the house was completed, Homer noticed the size of the water heater and said he would not pay the contract price.

Carl is now entitled to recover from Homer",multiple-choice,"nothing because his breach allows Homer to treat the contract as discharged.","the full contract price because the agreement did not specify the size of the water heater.","the full contract price because he substantially performed the contract.","the full contract price minus Homer's damages for breach of Carl's implied obligation to install a heater of the size reasonably required.",,,4,,Contracts

The contract stated: ""Homer's duty to pay shall not arise unless and until the house is constructed in full compliance with the attached specifications.""

Assume that the contract provided that Homer's payment for the house would be due upon receipt of the architect's certification that the house was built in accordance with the specifications. The architect refused to issue such certification ""because the fireplace was not constructed ina workmanlike manner as required by the specifications."" Homer refused to pay the contract price.

If Carl insists that the fireplace was constructed in a workmanlike manner and sues for the full contract price, who will prevail?",multiple-choice,"Homer, unless Carl proves that other architects would have been satisfied with the fireplace.","Homer, if Homer proved the architect's refusal was in good faith.","Car, unless Homer proves the architect's refusal to certify was both reasonable and in good faith.","Carl, if Carl proves that the fireplace was constructed in a workmanlike manner.",,,2,,Contracts

Assume that the day after entering into the contract with Homer, Carl borrowed $150,000 from Bank and assigned to Bank Carl's rights against Homer. Bank promptly notified Homer of the assignment. Carl performed 75% of the work and then abandoned the job.

Which of the following is the most accurate statement of the rights of Bank and Homer?",multiple-choice,"Bank has no rights against Homer because construction contracts are not assignable.","Bank, having accepted the assignment from Carl, must arrange for completion of the contract and cannot recover anything until the work is completed.","Bank may recover the reasonable value of the work performed by Carl minus damages to Homer caused by Carl's failure to complete the work.","Bank can recover the contract price minus the cost of completion of the contract.",,,3,,Contracts
