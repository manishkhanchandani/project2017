"On June 1, a seller and a buyer contracted in writing for the sale and purchase of the seller's cattle ranch (a large single tract) and to close the transaction on December 1.

The buyer unequivocally repudiated the contract on August 1. On August 15, the seller urged the buyer to change her mind and proceed with the scheduled closing on December 1. On October 1, having heard nothing further from the buyer, the seller sold and conveyed his ranch to a rancher without notice to the buyer. On December 1, the buyer attempted to close under the June 1 contract by tendering the full purchase price to the seller. The seller rejected the tender.

If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, the buyer will probably",multiple-choice,"A. 	win, because the seller failed to seasonably notify the buyer of any pending sale to the rancher.","B. 	win, because the seller waived the buyer's August 1 repudiation by urging her to retract it on August 15.","C. 	lose, because the buyer did not retract her repudiation before the seller materially changed his position in reliance thereon by selling the ranch to the rancher.","D. 	lose, because acceptance of the purchase price by the seller was a concurrent condition to the seller's obligation to convey the ranch to the buyer on December 1.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. If the effect of a repudiation is to deprive the non-repudiating party of a substantial part of the contract, it gives the non-repudiating party the right to terminate the contract and pursue remedies for total breach. The repudiating party, however, is still free to retract the repudiation and reinstate the contract if done before the non-repudiating party either materially relies on the repudiation or indicates that she considers the repudiation to be final. Although the buyer attempted to retract his repudiation on December 1, his repudiation was not timely because the seller had already materially relied on the repudiation on October 1 by conveying his ranch to the rancher.

A is incorrect because the seller did not have to give notice in order for his reliance to preclude retraction of the repudiation. B is incorrect because the seller's efforts to preserve the contractual relationship cannot be construed as waiving any right the seller had to pursue remedies for breach of contract. D is incorrect because the seller is not obligated to convey the ranch to the buyer if the buyer has repudiated the contract and the time for retracting the repudiation has passed.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On March 1, a mechanic contracted to repair a textile company's knitting machine by March 6. On March 2, the textile company contracted to manufacture and deliver specified cloth to a customer on March 15. The textile company knew that it would have to use the machine then under repair to perform this contract. Because the customer's order was for a rush job, the customer and the textile company included in their contract a liquidated damages clause, providing that the textile company would pay the customer $5,000 for each day's delay in delivery after March 15. 

The mechanic was inexcusably five days late in repairing the machine, and, as a result, the textile company was five days late in delivering the cloth to the customer. The textile company paid $25,000 to the customer as liquidated damages and then sued the mechanic for $25,000. Both the mechanic and the textile company knew when making their contract on March 1 that under ordinary circumstances the textile company would sustain few or no damages of any kind as a result of a five-day delay in the machine repair. 

Assuming that the $5,000-per-day liquidated damages clause in the contract between the textile company and the customer is valid, which of the following arguments will serve as the mechanic's best defense to the textile company's action?",multiple-choice,"A.	Time was not of the essence in the contract between the mechanic and the textile company.","B. 	The mechanic had no reason to foresee on March 1 that the customer would suffer consequential damages in the amount of $25,000.","C. 	By entering into the contract with the customer while knowing that its knitting machine was being repaired, the textile company assumed the risk of any delay loss to the customer.","D. 	In all probability, the liquidated damages paid by the textile company to the customer are not the same amount as the actual damages sustained by the customer in consequence of the late delivery of the cloth.",,,2,"Answer A is incorrect. The mechanic contracted to complete the repairs by a specified time. His failure to execute the repairs within the time set forth in the contract constituted a breach entitling the textile company to damages. The recovery of consequential damages, however, requires more than a determination of breach. Additional requirements, such as foreseeability of the damages, must be satisfied. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 346, 351.

Answer B is correct. Assuming other requirements are met, an aggrieved party is entitled to recover consequential damages only if they were reasonably foreseeable to the breaching party. The textile company did not inform the mechanic of its contract with the customer, and thus the mechanic had no reason to know what impact his failure to timely perform would have on the textile company's relationship with its customer. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 351.

Answer C is incorrect. The facts are insufficient to support this conclusion since the textile company had contracted with the mechanic for repairs to be completed within a time frame that would have allowed the textile company to timely fulfill its contractual obligations to the customer.

Answer D is incorrect. There are insufficient facts to support this conclusion. No information is provided concerning the actual damages sustained by the customer. Moreover, the facts assume the validity of the liquidated damages provision.",Remedies
"A buyer ordered from a seller 500 bushels of No. 1 Royal Fuzz peaches, at a specified price, ""for prompt shipment."" The seller promptly shipped 500 bushels, but by mistake shipped No. 2 Royal Fuzz peaches instead of No. 1. The error in shipment was caused by the negligence of the seller's shipping clerk.

Which of the following best states the buyer's rights and duties upon delivery of the peaches?",multiple-choice,"A. 	The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer and the buyer can refuse to accept them.","B. 	The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer but, since peaches are perishable, the buyer, if it does not want to accept them, must reship the peaches to the seller in order to mitigate the seller's losses.","C. 	The buyer must accept the peaches because a contract was formed when the seller shipped them.","D. 	Although a contract was formed when the seller shipped the peaches, the buyer does not have to accept them.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, an order to buy goods ""for prompt shipment"" is interpreted as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by a prompt shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods. Where the goods delivered fail to conform to the contract, the buyer may reject the goods if the rejection is made within a reasonable time after delivery. When the buyer ordered 500 bushels of peaches ""for prompt shipment,"" the seller accepted by shipping No. 2 (rather than No. 1) Royal Fuzz peaches, and therefore the buyer has the right to reject them. Answers A and B are incorrect because the prompt shipment will be interpreted as an acceptance even if the goods are non-conforming. Answer C is incorrect because although a contract was formed, the buyer has the right to reject non-conforming goods.","Formation of Contracts"
"On May 1 a lot owner telegraphed a buyer, ""Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grover subdivision at $5,000 each. Details will follow in letter."" The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, ""This offer remains open until June 1.""

On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, the buyer telegraphed the owner, ""Accept your offer with respect to lot 101."" Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grover subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150.

Assume that on May 5 the owner telephoned the buyer to explain that he had sold lots 102 through 150 to someone else on May 4 and that the buyer thereafter telegraphed the owner, ""Will take the rest of the lots."" Assume further that there is no controlling statute. In an action by the buyer against the owner for breach of contract, the buyer probably will",multiple-choice,"A. 	succeed, because the owner had promised him that the offer would remain open until June 1.","B. 	succeed, because the owner's attempted revocation was by telephone.","C. 	not succeed, because the buyer's power of acceptance was terminated by the owner's sale of the lots to another party.","D. 	not succeed, because the buyer's power of acceptance was terminated by an effective revocation.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The owner's telephone call on May 5 informing the buyer that the remaining lots had been sold was a manifestation of the owner's intention not to enter into a contract with the buyer for the remaining lots and thus a revocation of his May 1 offer.

A is incorrect because there was no consideration to support an option to keep the offer open for a definite time. B is incorrect because the owner's telephone call to the buyer on May 5 served as actual notification of the revocation. C is incorrect because the sale to someone else would constitute indirect notice of revocation only if buyer also received reliable information of the sale; in this case, however, the owner's telephone call on May 5 was the only notice of revocation that the buyer received.","Formation of Contracts"
"A contractor had painted an owner's house, according to specifications, under a contract which called for payment of $2,000. The owner, contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused to pay anything.

On June 15, the contractor mailed a letter to the owner stating, ""I am in serious need of money. Please send the $2,000 to me before July 1."" On June 18, the owner replied, ""I will settle for $1,800 provided you agree to repaint the porch."" The contractor did not reply to this letter.

Thereafter the owner mailed a check for $1,800 marked ""Payment in full on the painting contract as per letter dated June 18."" The contractor received the check on June 30. Because he was badly in need of money, the contractor cashed the check without objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the porch.

After cashing the check the contractor sued the owner for $200.00. The contractor probably will",multiple-choice,"A. 	succeed, because he can prove that he had painted the porch according to specifications.","B. 	succeed, because he cashed the check under economic duress.","C. 	not succeed, because he cashed the check without objection.","D. 	not succeed, because he is entitled to recover only the reasonable value of his services.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A promise to settle a claim may be consideration to support a return promise so long as there is a good faith dispute over the validity of the claim. The owner's June 18th letter, together with his check for $1,800 with the notation ""payment in full"" is an offer of accord and satisfaction. The contractor accepted this offer when he retained and cashed the check without objection. In doing so, he waived his right to the remaining $200 from the original contract.

A is incorrect because even if the contractor can establish that he painted the porch according to contract specifications, the owner's good faith belief that the contractor had not painted the porch properly is sufficient consideration for his offer of settlement. B is incorrect because although the contractor is in need of money, he has a reasonable alternative - he can refuse to make an accord and instead file a lawsuit for payment pursuant to the terms of the original agreement. D is incorrect because expectation damages, not reliance damages, are the standard measure of recovery in breach of contract claims.","Formation of Contracts"
"A client consulted a lawyer about handling the sale of the client's building, and asked the lawyer what her legal fee would be. The lawyer replied that her usual charge was $100 per hour, and estimated that the legal work on behalf of the client would cost about $5,000 at that rate. The client said, ""Okay, let's proceed with it,"" and the lawyer timely and successfully completed the work. Because of unexpected title problems, the lawyer reasonably spent 75 hours on the matter and shortly thereafter mailed the client a bill for $7,500, with a letter itemizing the work performed and time spent. The client responded by a letter expressing his good-faith belief that the lawyer had agreed to a total fee of no more than $5,000. The client enclosed a check in the amount of $5,000 payable to the lawyer and conspicuously marked, ""Payment in full for legal service in connection with the sale of the client's building."" Despite reading the ""Payment in full. . ."" language, the lawyer, without any notation of protest or reservation of rights, endorsed and deposited the check to her bank account. The check was duly paid by the client's bank. A few days later, the lawyer unsuccessfully demanded payment from the client of the $2,500 difference between the amount of her bill and the check, and now sues the client for that difference.

What, if anything, can the lawyer recover from the client?",multiple-choice,"A. 	Nothing, because the risk of unexpected title problems in a real-property transaction is properly allocatable to the seller's attorney and thus to the lawyer in this case.","B. 	Nothing, because the amount of the lawyer's fee was disputed in good faith by the client, and the lawyer impliedly agreed to an accord and satisfaction.","$2,500, because the client agreed to an hourly rate for as many hours as the work reasonably required, and the sum of $5,000 was merely an estimate.","The reasonable value of the lawyer's services in excess of $5,000, if any, because there was no specific agreement on the total amount of the lawyer's fee.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked ""payment in full."" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Although mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord, consideration is furnished where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Even if the client lacked sufficient legal basis to prevail on his claim, his good-faith belief in the validity of the claim makes his promise to settle sufficient consideration to support the modification. Therefore, when the lawyer read the ""payment in full"" language on the client's $5,000 check and then cashed it without protest, the lawyer accepted the accord and satisfaction of the debt. A, C and D are incorrect because they fail to take into account the effect of the discharge of the client's debt through accord and satisfaction.","Formation of Contracts"
"A photographer and a customer entered a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read as follows: ""[the photographer] to supply the customer with 200 personalized Christmas cards on or before December 15, bearing a photograph of [the customer] and his family, and [the customer] to pay $100 thirty days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by [the photographer] at [the customer]'s house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time."" Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by the photographer's not being notified promptly by the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, ""The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on time.""

Which of the following statements regarding the legal effect of the customer's illness is LEAST accurate?",multiple-choice,"A. 	The customer's illness and the related development excused the photographer from his obligations to deliver the cards on or before December 15.","B. 	Prompt notice by the customer to the photographer of the customer's recovery from illness was an implied condition of the photographer's duty under the circumstances.","C. 	The photographer was under a duty of immediate performance of his promise to deliver the cards, as of December 15, by reason of the express language of the contract and despite the illness of the customer and the related developments.","D. 	The customer's conduct after his illness constituted a waiver of the necessity of the photographer's performing on or before December 15.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Where the existence of a particular person is necessary for the performance of a duty, his incapacity, if sufficient to make performance impracticable, may operate to excuse performance of the contract. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of ""[the customer] and his family,"" the customer's availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer's duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer's delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer's recovery, his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct (informing the photographer to ""take the photograph anyway"") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline. Answer C is the least accurate statement since, as explained above, the customer's illness provided a basis for excuse of the delay.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"The aged mother of a sister and brother, both adults, wished to employ a live-in companion so that she might continue to live in her own home. Their mother, however, had only enough income to pay one-half of the companion's $2,000 monthly salary. Learning of their mother's plight, the siblings agreed with each other in a signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's lifetime, each would give their mother $500. Their mother then hired the companion.

The siblings made the agreed payments in January, February, and March. In April, however, the brother refused to make any payment and notified his sister and mother that he would make no further payments.

Will their mother succeed in an action for $500 brought against the brother after April 30?",multiple-choice,"A.	Yes, because by making his first three payments, the brother confirmed his intent to contract.","B.	Yes, because the mother is an intended beneficiary of a contract between the siblings.","C.	No, because a parent cannot sue her child for breach of a promise for support.","D.	No, because the siblings intended their payment to their mother to be gifts.",,,2,"B is correct. The mother was not a party to the contract between the sister and the brother, so the only way for her to have contractual rights is if she was the intended beneficiary of the contract. For the mother to be an intended beneficiary, she must be the person to whom performance is to be given. In this case several factors indicate that the mother is an intended beneficiary: the mother is named in the contract, the mother directly receives the payments, and the mother has a close familial relationship with the parties. Therefore, the mother is an intended beneficiary and will prevail in a suit against the brother for the $500 payment.

A is incorrect because modern contract law is based upon the objective test, which does not consider a party's private intent. The brother's intent is irrelevant. Further, whether a contract was formed is not at issue. The issue is whether the mother has contractual rights that may be asserted.

C is incorrect because the mother is simply asserting her rights as an intended beneficiary to the contract; her claim is not solely based on her relationship to the son. Furthermore, there is no rule of contract law which states that a parent may not sue a child.

D is incorrect because the promise to pay $500 was made in exchange for a mutual promise to pay the other $500. Because consideration was present, a contract was formed, and the $500 payments will not be considered gifts.","Third-Party Rights"
"On June 1, a wholesale company received a purchase-order form from a retailer, in which the latter ordered 1,000 anti-recoil widgets for delivery no later than August 30 at a delivered total price of $10,000, as quoted in the wholesale company's current catalog. Both parties are merchants with respect to widgets of all types. On June 2, the wholesale company mailed to the retailer its own form, across the top of which the wholesale company's president had written, ""We are pleased to accept your order."" This form contained the same terms as the retailer's form except for an additional printed clause in the wholesale company's form that provided for a maximum liability of $100 for any breach of contract by the wholesale company.

As of June 5, when the retailer received the wholesale company's acceptance form, which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the legal relationship between the wholesale company and the retailer?",multiple-choice,"A.	There is no contract, because the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form is a material alteration of the retailer's offer.","B.	There is no contract, because the retailer did not consent to the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form.","C.	There is an enforceable contract whose terms include the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form, because liquidation of damages is expressly authorized by the Uniform Commercial Code.","D.	There is an enforceable contract whose terms do not include the liability-limitation clause in the wholesale company's form.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, a written acceptance generally will operate as such even if it states additional or different terms. The additional or different terms, however, will not become part of the contract if they materially alter the contract, unless the offeror expressly agrees to such term. Although the wholesale company's form contained a limitation-on-liability clause, the acceptance, nonetheless, operated as an acceptance of the retailer's offer. Since the contract price was $10,000, the clause limiting wholesale company's liability to $100 proposes a material alteration to the contract and therefore will not become part of the contract, since the retailer did not expressly agree to it. A and B are incorrect, because the wholesale company's acceptance is effective notwithstanding the existence of a material additional term. C is incorrect because the liability-limitation clause proposes a material alteration and thus will not become part of the contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"QUESTION:

In exchange for valid and sufficient consideration, a mother orally promised her son, who had no car and wanted a minivan, ""to pay to anyone from whom you buy a minivan within the next six months the full purchase-price thereof."" Two months later, the son bought a used minivan on credit from a car dealership for $8,000. At the time, the dealership was unaware of the mother's earlier promise to her son, but learned of it shortly after the sale.

Can the dealership enforce the mother's promise to her son?
",multiple-choice,"A.	Yes, under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.","B.	Yes, because the dealership is an intended beneficiary of the mother-son contract.","C.	No, because the mother's promise to her son is unenforceable under the suretyship clause of the statute of frauds.","D.	No, because the dealership was neither identified when the mother's promise was made nor aware of it when the minivan sale was made.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. A party is an intended beneficiary of a promise if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties, such as where the promisor knows that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The dealership is an intended beneficiary of the mother's promise to her son because both parties understood that the purpose of the contract between them was to confer a benefit on the future seller of the son's minivan. This purpose is clear from the terms of the mother's promise, which was to pay the purchase price ""to anyone from whom you buy a minivan.""

A is incorrect because the dealership was not aware of the mother's promise at the time that it sold the minivan to the son, and therefore could not have relied on it. C is incorrect because the suretyship provision of the Statute of Frauds does not apply where the surety promise was made to the principal (the son) and not to the obligee (the dealership). D is incorrect because, although the dealership's identification and awareness of the mother's promise is relevant to determining when its rights as beneficiary vest, it is not relevant to determining whether it is an intended or incidental beneficiary.

"A buyer contracted in writing with a shareholder, who owned all of XYZ Corporation's outstanding stock, to purchase all of her stock at a specified price per share. At the time this contract was executed, the buyer's contracting officer said to the shareholder, ""Of course, our commitment to buy is conditioned on our obtaining approval of the contract from our parent company."" The shareholder replied, ""Fine. No problem.""

The shareholder subsequently refused to consummate the sale on the ground that the buyer had neglected to request the parent company's approval of the contract, which was true. The parent company's chief executive officer, however, is prepared to testify that the parent company would have routinely approved the contract if requested to do so. The buyer can also prove that he has made a substantial sale of other assets to finance the stock purchase, although he admittedly had not anticipated any such necessity when he entered into the stock purchase agreement.

If the buyer sues the shareholder for breach of contract, is the buyer likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the condition of the parent company's approval of the contract, being designed to protect only the buyer and the parent company, can be and has been waived by those entities.","Yes, because the buyer detrimentally relied on the shareholder's commitment by selling off other assets to finance the stock purchase.","No, because the express condition of the parent company's approval had not occurred prior to the lawsuit.","No, because obtaining the parent company's approval of the contract was an event within the buyer's control and the buyer's failure to obtain it was itself a material breach of contract.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a party who is subject to the condition, unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party. In other words, the effect of nonoccurrence of the condition will depend on whose obligation is subject to it. The express condition in the buyer-shareholder contract relating to the parent company's approval (""our commitment to buy is conditioned from the parent company"") affects the buyer's but not the shareholder's obligation. Since the facts suggest that both the buyer and the parent company are ready and willing to consummate the sale, it appears that those parties waived the nonoccurrence of the condition.

B is incorrect because, if the buyer himself did not have reason to expect that the contract would induce such a change in position on the buyer's part, then the buyer's reliance was not reasonably foreseeable to the shareholder either. C is incorrect because the nonoccurrence of the condition was waived by the buyer and the parent company. D is incorrect because, although the buyer's failure to obtain the parent company's approval might have provided a basis for excuse of the condition under prevention doctrine, the issue presented here is the effect of the nonoccurrence of the condition on the shareholder's obligation to sell.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A wholesaler contracted in a signed writing to sell to a bakery 10,000 pounds of flour each week for 10 weeks, the flour to be delivered to the bakery on Mondays and payment to be made on Wednesdays of each week. The bakery did all of its weekly bread baking on Tuesdays. On Monday morning of the first week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 8,000 pounds of flour to the bakery, and the bakery accepted it on the wholesaler's assurance that the remaining 2,000 pounds would be delivered later that evening, which it was. The bakery paid for both deliveries on Wednesday. On Monday of the second week, the wholesaler tendered delivery of 5,000 pounds of flour to the bakery and said that the remaining 5,000 pounds could not be delivered on Monday but would be delivered by Wednesday. The bakery rejected the tender.

Was the bakery legally justified in rejecting the tender of the 5,000 pounds of flour?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the bakery was legally entitled to reject any tender that did not conform perfectly to the contract.","Yes, because the tender was a substantial impairment of that installment and could not be cured.","No, because the tender was not a substantial impairment of the entire contract, and the wholesaler had given assurance of a cure.","No, because by accepting the first 8,000 pounds on Monday of the first week, the bakery had waived the condition of perfect tender and had not reinstated it.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. UCC § 2-612(2) provides that a buyer may reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. The delivery of less than the contracted-for amount constituted a nonconformity that substantially impaired the value of the installment since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs, and the bakery was entitled to reject the tender.

Answer A is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, but that rule is inapplicable to assess the conformance of a seller's performance under an installment contract. Because this is an installment contract, the substantial impairment standard governs the buyer's right to reject, and the bakery is entitled to reject under that standard. Under the substantial impairment standard, an installment can be rejected by the buyer only if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured. Furthermore, the whole contract is breached if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of the entire contract.

Answer C is incorrect. UCC § 2-612(2) provides that a buyer is entitled to reject any installment that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and it cannot be cured. A buyer's right to reject a particular installment is not dependent on a substantial impairment of the entire contract. Moreover, in this case, the wholesaler's assurance of cure was inadequate since the wholesaler could not deliver the remaining 5,000 pounds until the day after the bakery needed the flour to fulfill its weekly baking needs.

Answer D is incorrect. As stated above, a buyer's right to reject a delivery on an installment contract for the sale of goods is not governed by the perfect tender rule, but rather by the substantial impairment standard. Here, the bakery had the right to reject the second installment because the missing 5,000 pounds of flour could not be delivered for several days, substantially impairing the installment. Additionally, a buyer's previous acceptance of a nonconforming tender does not constitute a waiver of its right to reject a later nonconforming tender if the other grounds for rejection are satisfied.",Remedies
"The inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, ""The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not available in stores."" The owner of a retail specialty shop, wrote the inventor, ""What's your best, firm price for two dozen LBVCs."" The inventor sent a written reply that said in its entirety, ""We quote you for prompt acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVCs."" The owner of the retail specialty shop subsequently mailed a check to the inventor in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, ""I accept your offer for 24 LBVCs.""

The inventor shipped 24 LBVCs to the owner of the retail specialty shop after receiving his check and memo, and with the shipment sent the owner of the retail specialty shop an invoice that conspicuously stated, among other things, the following lawful provision: ""These items shall not be offered for resale at retail."" The owner of the retail specialty shop received and read but disregarded the invoice restriction and displayed the 24 LBVCs for resale.

The inventor has a cause of action against the owner of the retail specialty shop for breach of contract only if",multiple-choice,"The inventor, as inventor of the LBVC, was not a merchant.","the invoice restriction was a material alteration of the pre-existing terms.","the inventor's written reply that quoted $39.99 per LBVC, but did not contain a restriction on retail sales, was not an offer that the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted by ordering 24 LBVCs.","the owner of the retail specialty shop was consciously aware when taking delivery of the goods that the television ad had said, ""Not available in stores.""",,,3,"Answer C is correct. If the inventor's written reply was construed as an offer, the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted that offer when it tendered the requested payment and did not attempt to state additional or different terms in its acceptance. The inventor's letter with shipment, which contained an additional provision, would have no legal effect, and the inventor would not have a cause of action against the owner of the retail specialty shop. However, answer C assumes that the inventor's written reply that quoted $39.99 was not an offer. Based on that assumption, the inventor's shipment of the LBVCs with the attached invoice stating ""these items shall not be offered for resale at retail"" would be considered an offer and the owner of the retail specialty shop's acceptance and display of the products after reading the invoice would be considered an acceptance of the offer. Because the owner of the retail specialty shop accepted the offer, which included the provision restricting resale of the products, the inventor would have a cause of action against the owner.

Answer A is incorrect because merchant status does not govern all transactions involving the sale of goods and is not necessary for the owner of the retail specialty shop's acceptance to be valid. B is incorrect because the relevance of the invoice as a material alteration under the UCC battle of the forms provision, 2-207, is relevant only if the inventor was determined to be the offeree. Here, the owner of the retail specialty shop was the offeree and its acceptance was valid. D is incorrect because the language, ""Not available in stores,"" could not reasonably be construed as a prohibition on resale, and the inventor's letter to the owner of the retail specialty shop contained no such restriction.","Formation of Contracts"
"A radio manufacturer and a retailer, after extensive negotiations, entered into a final written agreement in which the manufacturer agreed to sell and the retailer agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A dispute arose in later December, 1990, when the retailer returned 25 undefective radios to the manufacturer for full credit after the manufacturer had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period.

In an action by the manufacturer against the retailer for damages due to return of the 25 radios, the manufacturer introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios for credit but was silent as to the return of undefective radios for credit. The retailer seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full credit. The manufacturer objects to the admissibility of this evidence.

Assume the following facts. When the retailer returned the 25 radios in question, it included with the shipment a check payable to the manufacturer for the balance admittedly due on all other merchandise sold and delivered to the retailer. The check was conspicuously marked, ""Payment in full for all goods sold to the retailer to date."" The manufacturer's credit manager, reading this check notation and knowing that the retailer had also returned the 25 radios for full credit, deposited the check without protest in the manufacturer's local bank account. The canceled check was returned to the retailer a week later.

Which of the following defenses would best serve the retailer?",multiple-choice,"The manufacturer's deposit of the check and its return to the retailer after payment estopped the manufacturer thereafter from asserting that the retailer owed any additional amount.","By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording, the manufacturer discharged any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.","By depositing the check without protest and with knowledge of its wording, the manufacturer entered into a novation discharging any remaining duty to pay on the part of the retailer.","The parties' good faith dispute over return of the radios suspended the duty of the retailer, if any, to pay any balance due",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked ""payment in full."" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, and if the amount owed to the creditor is an unliquidated sum, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Although mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the accord, consideration is furnished where the amount owed to the creditor is genuinely in dispute. Because there was a good faith dispute between the retailer and the manufacturer relating to the amount that the retailer owed, the check that was sent to settle the dispute furnished sufficient consideration to support the manufacturer's implicit promise to discharge the debt.

A and D are incorrect because when the manufacturer cashed the retailer's check without protest, it accepted the accord and satisfaction and discharged the debt. C is incorrect because there is no evidence of a novation.","Formation of Contracts"
"On April 1, an owner and a buyer signed a writing in which the owner, in consideration of $100 to be paid to the owner by the buyer, offered the buyer the right to purchase Greenacre for $100,000 within 30 days. The writing further provided, ""This offer will become effective as an option only if and when the $100 consideration is in fact paid."" On April 20, the owner, having received no payment or other communication from the buyer, sold and conveyed Greenacre to a citizen for $120,000. On April 21, the owner received a letter from the buyer enclosing a cashier's check for $100 payable to the owner and stating, ""I am hereby exercising my option to purchase Greenacre and am prepared to close whenever you're ready.""

Assume that, for whatever reason, the buyer prevails in the suit against the owner.

Which of the following is the buyer entitled to recover?",multiple-choice,"Nominal damages only, because the remedy of specific performance was not available to the buyer.","The fair market value, if any, of an assignable option to purchase Greenacre for $100,000.","$20,000, plus the amount, if any, by which the fair market value of Greenacre on the date of the owner's breach exceeded $120,000.","The amount, if any, by which the fair market value of Greenacre on the date of the owner's breach exceeded $100,000.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Although breach of a contract for real estate typically would entitle the buyer to specific performance, specific performance is not possible in this case because the property has been sold to the citizen. As a substitute for specific performance, the buyer may recover expectation damages, or damages that are intended to give the injured party the value of the promise. Damages to an injured buyer in a contract for the sale of real estate are usually measured by the difference between the contract price and the market value of the property as of the time that the buyer learned of the breach, plus any incidental or consequential damages. So if the buyer prevails in her suit against the owner, she may recover damages equal to the excess of the market value of Greenacre over the contract price.

A is incorrect because the buyer is entitled to recover either specific performance or expectation damages. B is incorrect because the owner's breach ultimately has caused the buyer to lose Greenacre itself and not just an option to purchase Greenacre. C is incorrect because typically expectation damages are not measured by the better of the contract price-resale price differential and the contract price-market value differential (although each of these is a theoretically possible method of measuring expectation damages).",Remedies
"A property owner and a landscape architect signed a detailed writing in which the landscape architect agreed to landscape the owner's residential property in accordance with a design prepared by the landscape architect and incorporated in the writing. The owner agreed to pay $10,000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement, and had no ownership interest in the premises.

At the owner's insistence, the written owner-architect agreement contained a provision that neither party would be bound unless the owner's law partner, an avid student of landscaping, should approve the landscape architect's design. Before the landscape architect commenced the work, the owner's law partner, in the presence of both the owner and the landscape architect, expressly disapproved the landscaping design. Nevertheless, the owner ordered the landscape architect to proceed with the work, and the landscape architect reluctantly did so. When the landscape architect's performance was 40% complete, the owner repudiated his duty, if any, to pay the contract price or any part thereof.

If the landscape architect now sues the owner for damages for breach of contract, which of the following concepts best supports the landscape architect's claim?",multiple-choice,"Substantial performance.","Promissory estoppel.","Irrevocable waiver of condition.","Unjust enrichment.",,,3,"C is correct. The nonoccurrence of an express condition will discharge the contractual obligation of a party who is subject to the condition, unless the nonoccurrence of the condition has been waived by that party. Once the waiver has been given, it cannot be revoked where it is made after the time for the fulfillment of the condition has passed or where the other party has relied on the waiver. Therefore, although the express condition to the owner-architect agreement did not occur (since the necessary approval was not given), the owner waived the condition when the owner ordered the work to proceed. Since the waiver occurred after the nonoccurrence of the condition, and since the landscape architect relied on the waiver by completing 40% of the work, the owner may not revoke the waiver.

A is incorrect. Substantial performance is not applicable where performance is subject to an express condition. B and D are incorrect. The landscape architect's claim is better supported on a breach of contract theory.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"Under a written agreement, a pastry company promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a specified unit price to a baked goods retailer for one year. The baked goods retailer promised not to sell any other supplier's baked buns.

Shortly after making the contract, and before the pastry company had tendered any buns, the baked goods retailer decided that the contract had become undesirable because of a sudden, sharp decline in its customers' demand for baked buns. It renounced the agreement and the pastry company sues for breach of contract.

Which of the following will the court probably decide?",multiple-choice,"The baked goods retailer wins, because mutuality of obligation was lacking in that the baked goods retailer made no express promise to buy any of the pastry company's baked buns.","The baked goods retailer wins, because the agreement was void for indefiniteness of quantity and total price for the year involved.","The pastry company wins, because the baked goods retailer's promise to sell at retail the pastry company's baked buns exclusively, if it sold any such buns at all, implied a promise to use its best efforts to sell the pastry company's one-year output of baked buns.","The pastry company wins, because under applicable law both parties to a sale-of-goods contract impliedly assume the risk of price and demand fluctuations.",,,3,"C is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for exclusive dealing in a good imposes on the part of the seller an obligation to use best efforts to supply the good and an obligation on the part of the buyer to use its best efforts to promote the good's sale. Therefore the baked goods retailer was under an implied obligation to use its best efforts to promote the sale of the pastry company's buns for the duration of the contract.

A is incorrect. The contract implied an obligation on the part of the baked goods retailer to use its best efforts to promote the sale of the buns. B is incorrect. Output contracts are not void for lack of indefiniteness. D is incorrect. It does not identify the legal rule that is at issue in the problem.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A U.S. manufacturer on the west coast gave a hardware retailer who was relocating to the east coast the following ""letter of introduction"" to a hardware wholesaler on the east coast.
This will introduce you to my good friend and former customer, a hardware retailer, who will be seeking to arrange the purchase of hardware inventory from you on credit. If you will let him have the goods, I will make good any loss up to $25,000 in the event of his default.

/Signed/ manufacturer.
The hardware retailer presented the letter to the hardware wholesaler, who then sold and delivered $20,000 worth of hardware to the hardware retailer on credit. The hardware wholesaler promptly notified the manufacturer of this sale.

Which of the following is NOT an accurate statement concerning the arrangement between the manufacturer and the hardware wholesaler?",multiple-choice,"It was important to enforceability of the manufacturer's promise to the hardware wholesaler that it be embodied in a signed writing.","By extending the credit to the hardware retailer, the hardware wholesaler effectively accepted the manufacturer's offer for a unilateral contract.","Although the manufacturer received no consideration from the hardware retailer, the manufacturer's promise is enforceable by the hardware wholesaler.","The manufacturer's promise is enforceable by the hardware wholesaler whether or not the hardware wholesaler gave the manufacturer seasonable notice of the extension of credit to the hardware retailer.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. An offer for a unilateral contract seeks acceptance by performance and not a return promise. In order for the acceptance to be effective, however, the offeree must give seasonable notice of acceptance to the promisor where the offeree has reason to know that the offeror will not learn of the acceptance without notice. The manufacturer's offer to the hardware wholesaler is an offer to enter a unilateral contract because the manufacturer does not seek a return commitment from the hardware wholesaler but rather for the wholesaler to provide credit to the hardware retailer. Because the hardware wholesaler lives far from the manufacturer, however, he has reason to know that the manufacturer will not learn of his acceptance unless he gives notice, and therefore the hardware wholesaler must give notice of the extension of credit to the hardware retailer.

A, B and C are incorrect because they are each accurate statements: the manufacturer's promise to guarantee the debt falls within the surety clause of the statute of frauds, the hardware wholesaler's extension of credit to the hardware retailer effected an acceptance of an offer for a unilateral contract, and the manufacturer's promise is enforceable by the hardware wholesaler notwithstanding the fact that the hardware retailer provided no consideration, because the consideration was furnished by the hardware wholesaler.","Formation of Contracts"
"On October 1, a toy store entered into a written contract with a toy factory for the purchase at $20 per unit of 1,000 mechanical dogs to be specially manufactured by the factory according to the store's specifications. The factory promised to deliver all of the dogs ""not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season,"" and the store promised to pay the full $20,000 price upon delivery. In order to obtain operating funds, the factory as borrower entered into a written loan agreement on October 5 with a finance company. In relevant part, this agreement recited, ""[the factory] hereby transfers and assigns to [the finance company] its [the factory's] October 1 mechanical dog contract with the store, as security for a 50-day loan of $15,000, the advance and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by [the factory]. . ."" No copy of this agreement, or statement relating to it, was filed in an office of public record.

On October 15, the factory notified the store, ""We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor, but the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order, however, not later than January 20."" The store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15.

On November 1, the store sues the factory for damages and alleges the above facts, except those relating to the factory-finance loan agreement. Upon the factory's motion to dismiss the complaint, the court should",multiple-choice,"sustain the motion, because the factory on October 15 stated its willingness, and gave assurance of its ability, to perform the contract in January.","sustain the motion, because the store's lawsuit is premature in any case until after November 15.","deny the motion, because the store's complaint alleges an actionable tort by the factory.","deny the motion, because the store's complaint alleges an actionable breach of contract by the factory.",,,4,"D is correct. Because the contract specified that the goods were to be delivered ""not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season,"" time was of the essence and was an express condition requiring strict compliance by the factory. The factory's failure to meet this condition gave the store the right to terminate their contract and to claim damages for the factory's breach.

A is incorrect. Performance by January 20 could not cure the breach given the fact that the factory knew the toys were necessary for the holiday season, which would have ended by January 20.

B is incorrect. The factory's October 15 letter constituted an anticipatory repudiation - advance notice of its intent to breach when the time for performance arrived - or breach in advance of the date for performance. Anticipatory repudiation gives rise to an immediate claim for breach and does not require the store to wait until after November 15.

C is incorrect. Although it appears that the factory employee may have been negligent, the store has a clear cut, valid breach of contract claim against the factory. The store does not have actual harm or injury to meet the damage requirement for a negligence suit as their damages were purely economic. Purely economic losses, or commercial losses, are pursued through contract law principles rather than tort law principles.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A buyer and a seller entered into a written contract for the sale of a copy machine, using the same form contract that they had used a number of times in the past. The contract stated that payment was due 30 days after delivery and provided that the writing contained the complete and exclusive statement of the parties' agreement. 

On several past occasions, the buyer had taken a 5% discount from the contract price when paying within 10 days of delivery, and the seller had not objected. On this occasion, when the buyer took a 5% discount for paying within 10 days, the seller objected because his profit margin on this particular machine was smaller than on his other machines. 

If the seller sues the buyer for breach of contract, may the buyer introduce evidence that the 5% discount was a term of the agreement?",multiple-choice,"No, because the seller timely objected to the buyer's proposal for different terms.","No, because the writing contained the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties.","Yes, because a modification made in good faith does not require consideration.","Yes, because evidence of course of dealing is admissible even if the writing contains the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties.",,,4,"A is incorrect. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as ""a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ."" In this case, on several past occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of dealing. Given the course of dealing between the parties, the seller's objection to the 5% discount, after the buyer had acted in accordance with the course of dealing, was ineffective. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, course-of-dealing evidence is admissible to explain or supplement a final written agreement. 

B is incorrect. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as ""a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ."" In this case, on several past occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of dealing. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, course-of-dealing evidence is admissible to explain or supplement a final written agreement even if the parties intended the agreement to be complete and exclusive. Accordingly, the course-of-dealing evidence is admissible. 

C is incorrect. UCC Article 2 contains a general rule that a good- faith modification does not require consideration to be enforceable. However, the enforceability of a modification is not at issue here. The issue here is whether the UCC's parol evidence rule will preclude the admissibility of evidence of course of dealing. The facts indicate that in the parties' previous contracts the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller. This conduct amounted to a course of dealing that is defined under UCC § 1-303(b) as ""a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ."" Because the UCC's parol evidence rule explicitly allows for the admission of course-of-dealing evidence to explain or supplement a final written agreement, the evidence is admissible. 

D is correct. Under UCC § 1-303(b), course of dealing is defined as ""a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction . . . ."" In this case, on several past occasions the buyer had taken a 5% discount without objection from the seller, thus establishing a course of dealing.

"A buyer mailed a signed order to a seller that read: ""Please ship us 10,000 widgets at your current price."" The seller received the order on January 7 and that same day mailed to the buyer a properly stamped, addressed, and signed letter stating that the order was accepted at the seller's current price of $10 per widget. On January 8, before receipt of the seller's letter, the buyer telephoned the seller and said, ""I hereby revoke my order."" The seller protested to no avail. The buyer received the seller's letter on January 9. Because of the buyer's January 8 telephone message, the seller never shipped the goods.

Under the relevant and prevailing rules, is there a contract between the buyer and the seller as of January 10?",multiple-choice,"No, because the order was an offer that could be accepted only by shipping the goods; and the offer was effectively revoked before shipment.","No, because the buyer never effectively agreed to the $10 price term.","Yes, because the order was, for a reasonable time, an irrevocable offer.","Yes, because the order was an offer that seller effectively accepted before the buyer attempted to revoke it.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Unless the offer is an option, the offeror may revoke an offer at any time before the offer has been accepted. Under the mail box rule, unless the offer specifies otherwise, notice of acceptance is effective upon dispatch in the mail if a mailed acceptance is invited by the terms of the offer. Because the buyer's order was mailed, the seller's properly stamped and addressed letter was invited by the terms of the offer and was therefore effective upon its dispatch on January 7. Because the buyer did not attempt to revoke the offer until January 8, the seller's acceptance created a contract.

A is incorrect because, although under the UCC an offer ""for prompt shipment"" can be accepted by prompt shipment of the goods, that is not the case here. B is incorrect because the buyer's offer manifested an agreement to purchase the widgets at the seller's ""current price;"" unless $10 was not the seller's current price, the price term was agreed to.

After the wife died, the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: ""In consideration of [the man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby promise to pay [the man] $1,000.""

Upon the husband's death, the man filed a claim for $1,000. The husband's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration.

In most states, would the man's saving of the wife's life be regarded as sufficient consideration for the husband's promise?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the husband was thereby morally obligated to the man.","Yes, because the husband was thereby materially benefited.","No, because the husband had not asked the man to save her.","No, because the value of the man's act was too uncertain.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration. Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Although the husband's promise states that it is given ""in consideration of the man's saving"" the wife's life, in fact it is not sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise. The husband did not make the promise to pay $1,000 in exchange for the man's act, nor did the man save the wife's life in exchange for the husband's promise.

A and B are incorrect because neither moral obligation nor material benefit alone is a sufficient basis for finding consideration. D is incorrect because the respective values of consideration exchanged is not relevant to whether consideration is sufficient; what matters is whether the consideration was bargained for.","Formation of Contracts"
"While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by the woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: ""I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident."" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The father replied: ""If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you.""

The father honestly believed that he did not owe the creditor anything and at first refused to pay anything to the creditor. If the creditor, honestly believing that the father owed him $200, then accepts $150 from the father in settlement of the claim, will the creditor succeed in an action against the father for the remaining $50?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the son's debt of $200 was liquidated and undisputed.","Yes, because the creditor honestly believed that he had a legal right against the father for the full $200.","No, because the father honestly believed that the creditor did not have a legal right against him for the $200.","No, because the father was not contractually obligated to pay the creditor $200 in the first place.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The creditor will not succeed against the father because the original contract has been discharged through accord and satisfaction. Partial payment of an original debt will satisfy as an accord and satisfaction if there is a bona fide dispute about the validity of the claim. Here, the father honestly did not believe that he owed the creditor. Therefore, the creditor's acceptance of $150 from the father ""in settlement of the claim"" is a valid accord and satisfaction, resulting in the discharge of the original contract. Thus, the creditor is not entitled to the remaining $50.

A is incorrect because the fact that the son's debt to the creditor was undisputed does not prevent the father's use of accord and satisfaction if the father believes in good faith that he does not owe the creditor. B is incorrect because the creditor's honest belief will not prevent the discharge of the original debt by accord and satisfaction if the creditor accepts the payment without reservation. D is incorrect because if the creditor believed in good faith that his claim against the son's estate was valid, then the creditor's forbearance of his legal right to sue was adequate consideration for the father's promise to pay $200.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"An agent engaged an inexperienced actress to do a small role in a new Broadway play for a period of six months at a salary of $200 a week. The actress turned down another role in order to accept this engagement. On the third day of the run, the actress was hospitalized with influenza and a replacement was hired to do the part. A week later, the actress recovered, but the agent refused to accept her services for the remainder of the contract period. The actress then brought an action against the agent for breach of contract.

Which of the following, if true, would adversely affect the actress' rights in her action against the agent?",multiple-choice,"The agent could only find one replacement, who demanded a contract for a minimum of six months if she was to perform at all.","The replacement, by general acclaim, was much better in the role than the original actress had been.","The agent had offered the original actress a position as the replacement's understudy at a salary of $100 a week, which the original actress declined.","The agent had offered the actress a secretarial position at a salary of $300 a week, which the actress declined.",,,1,"A is correct. Under the Doctrine of Constructive Conditions, a party's material breach of an obligation, if uncured, may have the effect of discharging the other party's obligation under the contract. Therefore, the agent's obligation may only be discharged if the actress's inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the actress will cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress's failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit under the contract. The fact that the agent could only find a replacement who demanded a six-month contract speaks to the extent of the loss to the agent due to the actress's absence and suggests that he was justified in withholding his own performance.

B is incorrect. The fact that the replacement may have been a better actress suggests that any breach by the original actress was partial because the agent was easily made whole during the actress's absence.

C and D are incorrect. The agent's offer of substitute employment is not relevant to whether the agent was justified in withholding the position that he promised to give the actress - he would only be so justified if the actress materially breached the contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A landowner contracted in a signed writing to sell Greenacre, a 500-acre tract of farmland, to a farmer. The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $500,000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15, the landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30, the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then, but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. When the landowner tendered the deed and possession on January 30, the farmer refused to accept either, and refused to pay the $500,000. Throughout the month of January, the market value of Greenacre was $510,000, and its fair monthly rental value was $5,000.

Will the landowner probably succeed in an action against the farmer for specific performance?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the court will excuse the delay in tender on the ground that there was a temporary impossibility caused by the tenant's holding over.","Yes, because time is ordinarily not of the essence in a land-sale contract.","No, because the landowner breached by failing to tender the deed and possession on January 15.","No, because the landowner's remedy at law for monetary relief is adequate.",,,2,"B is correct. When a party has committed only a partial (as opposed to a total) breach of a contract, the other party to the contract remains obligated to perform, and refusal to perform will give the partially-breaching party the right to either specific performance or damages for total breach. Because the facts suggest that timely delivery of possession of Greenacre is not of the essence in this agreement, the two-week delay is only a partial breach, and therefore the farmer's refusal to pay the purchase price was a repudiation which justified an action by the landowner for specific performance.

A is incorrect. These facts do not suggest excuse on grounds of impossibility. C is incorrect. Although the landowner's failure to deliver possession was a breach, it was only a partial breach. D is incorrect. Contracts involving the sale of land have historically been regarded as unique and therefore equitable relief has traditionally been allowed, even where the breaching party is the buyer.",Remedies
"A bank agreed to lend a merchant $10,000 for one year at 8% interest. The loan proceeds were to be disbursed within two weeks. The merchant intended to use the loan proceeds to purchase a specific shipment of carpets for resale at an expected profit of $5,000 but said nothing about these plans to the bank. The bank failed to disburse the proceeds and refused to assure the merchant that it would do so. The merchant was able to secure a loan from another lender at 10% interest for one year. However, by the time the merchant started the application process for a substitute loan, it was too late to pursue the opportunity to buy the shipment of carpets.

In an action against the bank for breach of contract, which of the following amounts is the merchant likely to recover?",multiple-choice,"Nothing, because damages for lost opportunities are not recoverable.","Nothing, because the parties failed to tacitly agree that the merchant would be entitled to damages in the event of a breach by the bank.","The difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and a loan at 8%.","$5,000, the merchant's foreseeable loss.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The presumed wide availability of credit limits a borrower's recovery to the additional cost of obtaining a loan from another lender. In the typical case, a lender has no reason, at the time of contract formation, to foresee that a borrower will not be able to obtain a substitute loan. Furthermore, at the time of contract formation under these facts, the bank was not aware and had no reason to be aware of the merchant's opportunity to purchase the carpets. Therefore, the merchant's recovery is limited to the difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and one at 8%.

Answer A is incorrect. Damages for lost opportunities may be recoverable in some cases as consequential damages for a breach of contract. However, consequential damages for the lost opportunity to purchase the carpets are not appropriate under these facts for two reasons. First, because of the presumed wide availability of credit, the bank had no reason, at the time of contract formation, to foresee that the merchant would not be able to obtain a substitute loan. Second, at the time of contract formation, the bank was not aware and had no reason to be aware of the merchant's opportunity to purchase the carpets. However, the merchant is entitled to recover the difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and one at 8%.

Answer B is incorrect. The tacit-agreement test has been rejected by courts and by the UCC. Here, the merchant is entitled to recover the difference in cost over time between a loan at 10% and one at 8%.

Answer D is incorrect. Damages for lost opportunities may be recoverable in some cases as consequential damages for a breach of contract. However, consequential damages for the lost opportunity to purchase the carpets are not appropriate under these facts for two reasons. First, because of the presume wide availability of credit, the bank had no reason, at the time of contract formation, to foresee that the merchant would not be able to obtain a substitute loan.

"On November 15, a contractor, in a signed writing, contracted with a homeowner for an agreed price to personally remodel the homeowner's kitchen according to specifications provided by the homeowner and to start work on December 1. The contractor agreed to provide all materials for the job in addition to all of the labor required.

On November 26, the homeowner without legal excuse repudiated the contract. Notwithstanding the homeowner's repudiation, however, the contractor subsequently purchased for $5,000 materials that could only be used in remodeling the homeowner's kitchen, and promptly notified the homeowner, ""I will hold you to our contract."" If allowed to perform, the contractor would have made a profit of $3,000 on the job.

If the homeowner refuses to retract his repudiation, and the contractor sues him for damages, what is the maximum that the contractor is entitled to recover?",multiple-choice,"Nothing, because he failed to mitigate his damages.","$3,000, his expectation damages.","$5,000, on a restitutionary theory.","$5,000, his reliance damages, plus $3,000, his expectation damages.",,,2,"B is correct. When a contractor is injured due to an owner's breach of a construction contract, the contractor generally can recover as expectation damages his expected profit on the contract along with any labor and material expenses incurred up until the time that he learned of the owner's breach. The contractor may not recover for damages that he could have mitigated with reasonable effort. Therefore, the contractor may recover as damages his expected profit on his contract with the homeowner. He cannot, however, recover the $5,000 that he spent on materials because he incurred those expenses after being notified of the homeowner's repudiation of the contract.

A is incorrect. The contractor is only prevented from recovering the damages that he could have mitigated with reasonable effort. C is incorrect. The $5,000 expense did not confer a benefit on the homeowner (and because restitution is not available where damages are recoverable on the contract). D is incorrect. The $5,000 expense could have been mitigated by the contractor with reasonable effort and therefore should not be awarded as damages.",Remedies
"A business owner entered into a contract with a painter, by the terms of which the painter was to paint the owner's office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over the following weekend so as to avoid disruption of the owner's business.

Assume the following facts. The painter commenced work on Saturday morning and had finished half the painting by the time he quit work for the day. That night, without the fault of either party, the office building was destroyed by fire.

Which of the following is an accurate statement?",multiple-choice,"Both parties' contractual duties are discharged, and the painter can recover nothing from the owner.","Both parties' contractual duties are discharged, but the painter can recover in quasi-contract from the owner.","Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged, because the owner's performance (payment of the agreed price) is not impossible.","Only the painter's contractual duty is discharged, and the painter can recover his reliance damages from the owner.",,,2,"B is correct. When the existence of a specific thing (such as the owner's office) is necessary for the performance of a contractual obligation, the destruction of that thing is a supervening event that relates to a basic assumption of the contract; this effectively discharges any obligation of either party under that contract. However, any benefit conferred under the contract prior to the supervening event may be recovered in restitution. Therefore, the destruction of the owner's office discharged the painter's obligation to paint and the owner's obligation to pay for the work. Payment for the work that was already done, however, is nonetheless recoverable in restitution, or quasi-contract.

A is incorrect. The painter can recover in restitution. C is incorrect. Both parties' obligations are effectively discharged. D is incorrect. Generally, a party cannot recover for reliance damages when a contract has been discharged on grounds of impossibility.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On November 1, an accountant and a lawyer contracted for the sale by the accountant to the lawyer of the law books the accountant had inherited from his father. The lawyer agreed to pay the purchase price of $10,000 when the accountant delivered the books on December 1.

On November 10, the lawyer received a signed letter from the accountant that stated: ""I have decided to dispose of the book stacks containing the law books you have already purchased. If you want the stacks, I will deliver them to you along with the books on December 1 at no additional cost to you. Let me know before November 15 whether you want them. I will not sell them to anyone else before then."" On November 14, the lawyer faxed and the accountant received the following message: ""I accept your offer of the stacks."" The accountant was not a merchant with respect to either law books or book stacks.

Assume that on November 12 the accountant told the lawyer that he had decided not to part with the stacks.

Will this communication operate as a legally effective revocation of his offer to deliver the stacks?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the lawyer had a pre-existing obligation to pay $10,000 for the law books.","Yes, because the accountant was not a merchant with respect to book stacks.","No, because the accountant had given a signed assurance that the offer would be held open until November 15.","No, because by delaying his acceptance until November 14, the lawyer detrimentally relied on the accountant's promise not to sell the stacks to anyone else in the meantime.",,,2,"B is correct. Under the UCC's firm offer rule, an offer by a merchant contained in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it is firm will be irrevocable notwithstanding lack of consideration for the time stated in the offer (if less than three months). A merchant is a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction. Because the accountant is not a merchant of law books or stacks, his November 10 offer to deliver the book stacks does not fall under the UCC firm offer rule and can be revoked at any time. Further, because the lawyer did not give consideration to support an option, the offer is revocable at any time prior to acceptance by the lawyer.

A is incorrect. The call of the question is asking whether the accountant's communication on November 12 will operate as a legally effective revocation of his offer to deliver the stacks. While it is true that the lawyer did not give consideration to support the option, it does not best address the accountant's communication. C is incorrect. The accountant's assurance does not fall within the firm offer rule, nor is it supported by consideration. D is incorrect. Any reliance on the accountant's promise by the lawyer was not reasonable.","Formation of Contracts"
"A seller and a buyer have dealt with each other in hundreds of separate grain contracts over the last five years. In performing each contract, the seller delivered the grain to the buyer and, upon delivery, the buyer signed an invoice that showed an agreed upon price for that delivery. Each invoice was silent in regard to any discount from the price for prompt payment. The custom of the grain trade is to allow a 2% discount from the invoice price for payment within 10 days of delivery. In all of their prior transactions and without objection from the seller, the buyer took 15 days to pay and deducted 5% from the invoice price.

The seller and buyer recently entered into a contract for a single delivery of wheat at a price of $300,000. The same delivery procedure and invoice were used for this contract as had been used previously. The seller delivered the wheat and the buyer then signed the invoice. On the third day after delivery, the buyer received the following note from the seller: ""Payment in full in accordance with signed invoice is due immediately. No discounts permitted."" s/Seller.

Which of the following statements concerning these facts is most accurate?",multiple-choice,"The custom of the trade controls, and the buyer is entitled to take a 2% discount if he pays within 10 days.","The parties' course of dealing controls, and the buyer is entitled to take a 5% discount if he pays within 15 days.","The seller's retraction of his prior waiver controls, and the buyer is entitled to no discount.","The written contract controls, and the buyer is entitled to no discount because of the parol evidence rule.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The Uniform Commercial Code controls. UCC § 2-202, which is the UCC embodiment of the parol evidence rule, explicitly provides that, while a final written expression of agreement may not be contradicted by any prior agreement, it may be explained or supplemented ""by course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance."" A course of dealing, when inconsistent with a usage of trade, controls. Therefore, the agreement in this case should be interpreted to embody the course of dealing of the parties, which provided for a 5% discount if payment was made within 15 days. Thus, Answer B is correct, and Answers A and D are incorrect.

Answer C is incorrect. This question doesn't raise an issue of waiver or retraction of a waiver, because there is no indication that payment within 15 days at a 5% discount is inconsistent with the parties' agreement. In fact, the seller's invoice is silent on the matter. Instead, the question goes to the meaning of the agreement made by the parties. As explained above, the parol evidence rule will allow the introduction of evidence of trade usage. Therefore, the agreement in this case, which is silent on the discount matter, should be interpreted to embody the course of dealing of the parties, which provided for a 5% discount if payment was made within 15 days.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"On May 1, a seller and a buyer entered into a written contract, signed by both parties, for the sale of a tract of land for $100,000. Delivery of the deed and payment of the purchase price were scheduled for July 1. On June 1, the buyer received a letter from the seller repudiating the contract. On June 5, the buyer bought a second tract of land at a higher price as a substitute for the first tract. On June 10, the seller communicated a retraction of the repudiation to the buyer.

The buyer did not tender the purchase price for the first tract on July 1, but subsequently sued the seller for breach of contract.

Will the buyer likely prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because the seller retracted the repudiation prior to the agreed time for performance.","No, because the buyer's tender of the purchase price on July 1 was a constructive condition to the seller's duty to tender a conveyance.","Yes, because the seller's repudiation was nonretractable after it was communicated to the buyer.","Yes, because the buyer bought the second tract as a substitute for the first tract prior to the seller's retraction.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The general rule is that a repudiating party may retract its repudiation. An attempted retraction is ineffective, however, if it occurs after the injured party has materially changed its position in reliance on the repudiation. The buyer's purchase of the second tract as a substitute for the first tract, which occurred before the seller's attempted retraction, constituted a material change in position and thus terminated the seller's ability to retract his repudiation. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. Ordinarily in a real estate transaction the tender of the purchase price and of the real property are to occur simultaneously. Here, however, the seller's repudiation and the buyer's subsequent action in reliance on the repudiation discharged the buyer's obligation to tender the purchase price on July 1. 

Answer C is incorrect. A repudiation may be retracted unless the injured party materially changes position or considers the repudiation final before the retraction. In this case, the buyer materially changed his position when he bought the second tract as a replacement for the first.",Remedies
"A father had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son and the son's fiancé a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10, 2002. Pursuant to that promise, the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on May 1, 2001, and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof:

The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by the father, and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $18,000. The father agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1, 2001, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met.

The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001, when he also began building the house. The father made three $2,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September 2001, without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 2001, to the end of February 2002, because of bad weather, and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1, 2002, the contractor demanded payment of $2,000, but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.

The contractor failed to object to the father's failure to make payments on November 1, December 1, January 1, and February 1. Additionally, the father made payments in August through October without requiring a certificate from Builders. What was the probable legal effect of these actions?",multiple-choice,"Estoppel-type waiver as to both the contractor's failure to object and the father's payments without requiring a certificate.","Waiver of delay in payment as to the contractor's failure to object and revocable waiver as to the father's payments without requiring a certificate.","Mutual rescission of the contract.","Discharge of the father's duty to make the four payments as to the contractor's failure to object and estoppel-type waiver as to the father's payments with requiring a certificate.",,,2,"B is correct. The condition in the contract fixing the time for payment was not a material part of the agreed exchange and therefore was subject to repeated waiver when the contractor failed to object as each of the four months passed without payment. By doing so, the contractor voluntarily abandoned this contractual condition for these months. The condition requiring a monthly certification prior to payment was waived by the father each time he made monthly payments without requiring certification. However, the father would be permitted to revoke the waiver and reinstate the certification condition as to future payments if he allowed the contractor reasonable time to obtain the certificates and if the contractor had not detrimentally relied upon the waiver.

A is incorrect. Neither the contractor nor the father, by failing to assert the condition, caused the other to detrimentally rely on the fact that the condition would not be asserted. As to the contractor's failure to demand monthly payment, he had done no work during these months due to bad weather, and this would not indicate that he would not demand payment when he once again began working. As to the father's waiver of certificate each month, the father retained the ultimate right to inspect before taking possession; thus, the contractor could not have detrimentally relied upon the failure to issue certificates.

C is incorrect. The contractor and the father did not make an agreement to rescind; this would be necessary given the fact that their waivers of condition resulted in the contract remaining enforceable.

D is incorrect. The contractor did not manifest an intent to discharge the father's duty to pay when he failed to insist on monthly payments during a time in which he could not perform.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On March 1, a landowner and builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the landowner's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across a neighbor's lot, to a lake. The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel.

Assume that the landowner tendered the $2,500 on March 15, and that the builder refused to accept it or to perform. In an action by the landowner against the builder for breach of contract, which of the following can the builder successfully use as a defense?",multiple-choice,"The neighbor-landowner agreement permitting the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot was not in writing.","The landowner-builder agreement was not in writing.","The landowner-builder agreement was not in writing and the neighbor-landowner agreement permitting the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot was not in writing.","The builder does not have a defense.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the Statute of Frauds, a promise to sell an interest in land must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute to be enforceable. Although the land contract provision of the statute has been broadly construed to include rights of way, the neighbor-landowner agreement does not fall within the land contract provision because the neighbor's promise (""permitting the digging"") was a gratuitous conveyance and not a contract for sale. Similarly, a promise that cannot be performed within a year of its making falls within the one-year provision of the statute. Because the landowner-builder agreement was made on March 1 and the performance is to be completed by June 1, this agreement falls outside the one-year provision since it can be performed within a year of its making. Because neither agreement falls within the statute of frauds, the fact that the agreements were not in writing is not a valid defense. Therefore, A, B and C are incorrect.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A wallpaper hanger sent a general contractor, this telegram:
Will do all paperhanging on new Doctors' Building, per owner's specs, for $14,000 if you accept within reasonable time after main contract awarded.

/s/ the wallpaper hanger
Three other competing hangers sent the general contractor similar bids in the respective amounts of $18,000, $19,000, and $20,000. The general contractor used the wallpaper hanger's $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors' Building. Before the bids were opened, the wallpaper hanger truthfully advised the general contractor that the former's telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked. Shortly thereafter, the general contractor was awarded the Doctors' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with another paperhanger for a price of $18,000. The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover $4,000.

Which of the following, if proved, would best support the wallpaper hanger's defense?",multiple-choice,"The general contractor gave the wallpaper hanger no consideration for an irrevocable sub-bid.","The wallpaper hanger's sub-bid expressly requested the general contractor's acceptance after awarding of the main contract.","Even after paying $18,000 for the paperhanging, the general contractor would make a net profit of $100,000 on the Doctors' Building contract.","Before submitting her own bid, the general contractor had reason to suspect that the wallpaper hanger had made a computational mistake in figuring his sub-bid.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of unilateral mistake if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract that has a material effect on the exchange, if the party asserting mistake should not bear the risk of the mistake and if either (i) the non-mistaken party has reason to know of the mistake or (ii) the effect of the mistake would make enforcement of the contract unconscionable. The wallpaper hanger may argue that the sub-contract should be rescinded on grounds of the $4,000 mistake that he made in computing his sub-bid. If the general contractor had reason to know of the computational error, this would greatly support the wallpaper hanger's argument. Choice A is incorrect because the bid may be found to be irrevocable on a reliance theory even in the absence of an option promise supported by consideration. B is incorrect because it is irrelevant. C is incorrect because the mere fact that the general contractor would make a substantial profit on the contract does not make the effect of the mistake unconscionable.","Formation of Contracts"
"On November 1, the following notice was posted in a privately-operated law school:

The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before May 1.
A student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, ""I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer."" This note was inadvertently placed in the student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore:

The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn.
The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $500. The law faculty refused to pay anything.

As to the student, was the offer effectively revoked?",multiple-choice,"Yes, by the faculty's second notice.","No, because it became irrevocable after a reasonable time had elapsed.","No, because of the student's reliance, prior to April 1, on the offer.","No, because the student was aware of the April 1 posting.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Where an offer is for a unilateral contract (an offer that seeks only performance and does not seek a return promise) and the offeree begins the invited performance, the offeror may not revoke the promise. This rule is intended to protect the substantial reliance of the offeree that results when accepting an offer for a unilateral contract by performance over a period of time. Because the faculty's offer of $500 sought only performance (winning the competition) and did not seek a commitment to perform, it was an offer for a unilateral contract. Once the student commenced performance, the faculty was not free to revoke the offer, so its attempted revocation on April 1 was ineffective.

Therefore A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the offer became irrevocable only when the student commenced the requested performance. D is incorrect because the offer became irrevocable once the student commenced performance, which occurred before April 1.","Formation of Contracts"
"A construction company contracted with a warehouse owner to construct for $500,000 a warehouse and an access driveway at highway level. Shortly after commencing work on the driveway, which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material, the construction company unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock.

The construction company informed the warehouse owner (accurately) that because of the rock, the driveway as specified would cost at least $20,000 more than figured, and demanded that for that reason a total contract price of $520,000. Since the warehouse owner was expecting warehousing customers immediately after the agreed completion date, he signed a writing promising to pay the additional $20,000. Following timely completion of the warehouse and driveway, which conformed to the contract in all respects, the warehouse owner refused to pay the construction company more than $500,000.

What is the maximum amount to which the construction company is entitled?",multiple-choice,"$500,000, because there was no consideration for warehouse owner's promise to pay the additional $20,000.","$500,000, because the warehouse owner's promise to pay the additional $20,000 was exacted under duress.","$520,000, because modification was fair and was made in the light of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the original contract was made.","$520,000, because the reasonable value of the construction company's total performance was that much or more.",,,3,"C is correct. Under the common law, a modification of a contract is unenforceable for lack of consideration (since performance of a pre-existing duty is not sufficient consideration to support the modification). However, where there is an unforeseen difficulty so severe it rises to the level of impracticability, the consideration requirement for a modification will be considered satisfied by the party's promise to complete their pre-existing contractual duty. To be impracticable, the performing party needs to have encountered extreme and unreasonable difficulty or expense that was not anticipated at the time of formation. Here, the construction company ran into an expensive difficulty that caused an increase of $20,000 in the expense to build the driveway. This difficulty was not foreseen by either party, and the increase was an accurate reflection of the cost to deal with the unforeseen difficulty. Therefore, the written modification is valid and the construction company is entitled to a maximum amount of $520,000.

A is incorrect. It fails to take into account the exception to the general common law rule. B is incorrect. The facts do not show that the modification was coercive. D is incorrect. It is the terms of the contract, not the reasonable value of the performance, which governs the recovery in this situation.","Formation of Contracts"
"A man owed his friend $1,000, plus interest at 8% until paid, on a long-overdue promissory note, collection of which would become barred by the statute of limitations on June 30. On the preceding April 1, the man and his friend both signed a writing in which the man promised to pay the note in full on the following December 31, plus interest at 8% until that date, and the friend promised not to sue on the note in the meantime. The friend, having received some advice from his nonlawyer brother-in-law, became concerned about the legal effect of the April 1 agreement. On May 1, acting pro se as permitted by the rules of the local small claims court, he filed suit to collect the note.

Assume that on January 2 of the following year the friend's suit has not come to trial, the man has not paid the note, the friend has retained a lawyer, and the lawyer, with leave of court, amends the complaint to add a second count to enforce the promise the man made in the April 1 agreement.

Does the new count state a claim upon which relief can be granted?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the man's failure to pay the note, plus interest, on December 31 makes the friend's breach of promise not to sue before that date no longer material.","Yes, because the man's April 1 promise is enforceable by reason of his moral obligation to pay the debt.","No, because such relief would undermine the policy of the statute of limitations against enforcement of stale claims.","No, because the man's April 1 promise was lawfully conditioned upon the friend's forbearing to sue prior to December 31.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's obligation under a contract is conditioned upon substantial performance of the other party's obligation under the same agreement. In other words, a material breach of an obligation has the effect of discharging the other party's obligation. Therefore, the man's obligation to pay the note in full was conditioned upon the friend refraining from bringing suit on the note. The friend breached that obligation on May 1, and therefore the man's obligation is no longer enforceable.

Answer A is incorrect because the materiality of the breach is to be determined at the time that it occurs. Answer B is incorrect because moral obligation is not sufficient to enforce a promise. Answer C is incorrect because the friend's claim against the man was based upon the April 1 agreement, a newly created obligation.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On March 1, a seller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to the buyer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. The buyer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a debt which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor.

On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the creditor.

If the buyer refused to pay more than $45,000 for Homestead, in an action by the seller against the buyer for an additional $1,000, it would be to the seller's advantage to try to prove that",multiple-choice,"the writing was intended only as a sham.","the writing was only a partial integration.","there was a mistake in integration.","there was a misunderstanding between the seller and the buyer concerning the purchase price.",,,3,"C is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of an agreement made prior to the adoption of a final writing if the prior agreement relates to matters within the scope of that writing. However, where a clerical error has been made in reducing an agreement to writing, a party may bring an action in equitable reformation to have the writing reformed to correct the error or to include an omitted provision. The parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to show the mistake that provides the basis for reformation. Therefore, if the buyer and the seller verbally agreed that the buyer would pay $46,000 in exchange for Homestead but the writing stated $45,000 due to an error in transcription, the seller may seek to have the writing reformed on grounds of mistake.

A is incorrect. The extrinsic evidence does not support the suggestion that the writing is a sham. B is incorrect. Evidence that the actual agreed price for Homestead was $46,000 contradicts the writing, and therefore extrinsic evidence would likely be excluded regardless of whether the agreement was only partially integrated. D is incorrect. Proving a misunderstanding about the purchase price would not provide a defense to enforcing the agreement as written.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"On December 1, a broker contracted with a collector to sell her one of a certain type of rare coin for $12,000, delivery and payment to occur on the next March 1. To fulfill that contract, and without the collector's knowledge, the broker contracted on January 1 to purchase for $10,000 a specimen of that type of coin from a hoarder, delivery and payment to occur on February 1. The market price of such coins had unexpectedly fallen to $8,000 by February 1, when the hoarder tendered the coin and the broker repudiated.

On February 25, the market in such coins suddenly reversed and had stabilized at $12,000 on March 1. The broker, however, had failed to obtain a specimen of the coin and repudiated his agreement with the collector when she tendered the $12,000 agreed price on March 1.

Later that day, after learning by chance of the broker's dealing with the collector, the hoarder telephoned the collector and said: ""Listen, the broker probably owes me at least $2,000 in damages for refusing wrongfully to buy my coin for $10,000 on February 1 when the market was down to $8,000. But I'm in good shape in view of the market's recovery since then, and I think you ought to get after the so-and-so.""

If the collector immediately sues the broker for his breach of the broker-hoarder contract, which of the following will the court probably decide?",multiple-choice,"The broker wins, because the collector, if a beneficiary at all of the broker-hoarder contract, was only an incidental beneficiary.","The broker wins, because as of March 1 neither the hoarder nor the collector had sustained any damage from the broker's repudiation of both contracts.","The collector wins, because she was an intended beneficiary of the broker-hoarder contract, under which damages for the broker's repudiation became fixed on February 1.","The collector wins, because she took an effective assignment of the hoarder's claim for damages against the broker when the hoarder suggested that the collector ""get after the so-and-so.""",,,1,"Answer A is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. A party is an intended beneficiary of a promise if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties, such as where the promisor must know that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The collector is only an incidental beneficiary of the broker-hoarder contract because the facts suggest that, in agreeing to sell the rare coin to the broker on February 1, the hoarder did not intend to confer a benefit on the collector.

Answer B is incorrect because under the UCC, damages to the hoarder were to be calculated as of the time that the hoarder learned of the broker's repudiation, which was February 1, when the market price had fallen below the contract price. Answer C is incorrect because the collector was only an incidental beneficiary. Answer D is incorrect because in order to be effective, an assignment of contract rights requires language of present transfer; the phrase ""I think you ought to get after the so-and-so"" was insufficient to effect an assignment of the hoarder's rights under the hoarder-broker contract.","Third-Party Rights"
"A woman owns an exceptionally seaworthy boat that she charters for sport fishing at a $500 daily rate. The fee includes the use of the boat with the woman as the captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1, a father agreed with the woman that the father would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear.

At the time of contracting, the woman told the father to be at the dock at 5 a.m. on May 15. The father and his family, however, did not show up on May 15 until noon. In the meantime, the owner of the boat agreed at 10 a.m. to take a second family out fishing for the rest of the day. The second family happened to come by and inquire about the possibility of such an outing. In view of the late hour, the owner of the boat charged the family $400 and stayed out two hours beyond the customary return time. The father's failure to appear until noon was due to the fact that he had been trying to charter another boat across the bay at a lower rate and had gotten lost after he was unsuccessful in getting such a charter.

Which of the following is an accurate statement concerning the rights of the parties?",multiple-choice,"The woman can retain the $200 paid by the father, because it would be difficult for the woman to establish her actual damages and the sum appears to have been a reasonable forecast in light of anticipated loss of profit from the charter.","The woman is entitled to retain only $50 (10% of the contract price) and must return $150 to the father.","The woman must return $100 to the father in order to avoid her own unjust enrichment at the father's expense.","The woman must return $100 to the father, because the liquidated-damage clause under the circumstances would operate as a penalty.",,,1,"A is correct. A party in breach generally is entitled to restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the way of part performance in excess of the loss resulting from the breach. Where the parties have agreed that the breaching party's performance is to be retained as liquidated damages, the breaching party is not entitled to restitution if the liquidated damages clause is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual damages resulting from the breach and the difficulty of proving damages. Although the father may argue that the woman was unjustly enriched to the extent that the deposit exceeded her actual loss, the woman should be able to retain the $200 deposit. Damages representing the inconvenience to the woman resulting from the father's failure to appear are difficult to estimate, and $200 was a reasonable estimate of the anticipated opportunity cost to the woman of not taking other potential customers.

B is incorrect. The common law rule on liquidated damages does not specify any maximum percentage. C and D are incorrect. The liquidated damages clause may be enforceable even if the amount of damages specified in the clause exceeds the woman's actual loss.",Remedies
"A landholder was land-rich by inheritance but money-poor, having suffered severe losses on bad investments, but still owned several thousand acres of unencumbered timberland. He had a large family, and his normal, fixed personal expenses were high. Pressed for cash, he advertised a proposed sale of standing timber on a choice 2,000-acre tract. The only response was an offer by a logger, the owner of a large, integrated construction enterprise, after inspection of the advertised tract.

The logger offered a fair price for the timber rights in question, and the landholder accepted the offer. The 2,000-acre tract was an abundant wild-game habitat and had been used for many years, with the landholder's permission, by area hunters. The logger's performance of the timber contract would destroy this habitat. Without legal excuse and over the landholder's strong objection, the logger repudiated the contract before commencing performance. The landholder could not afford to hire a lawyer and take legal action, and made no attempt to assign any cause of action he might have had against the logger.

If the logger is sued for breach of the contract by the landholder's next-door neighbor, whose view of a nearby lake is obscured by the standing timber, the neighbor will probably",multiple-choice,"lose, as only an incidental beneficiary, if any, of the logger-landholder contract.","lose, as a maintainer of nuisance litigation.","prevail, as a third-party intended beneficiary of the logger-landholder contract.","prevail, as a surrogate for the landholder in view of his inability to enforce the contract.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. A party is an intended beneficiary of a promise if recognition of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties, such as where the promisor knows that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The landholder's next-door neighbor lacks standing to enforce the logger-landholder contract because he is neither a party nor an assignee of the landholder's rights under the contract. He also lacks standing as a third party beneficiary because, although the logger's performance of the contract may have benefited the neighbor, the facts do not suggest that this was either party's intent when entering into the contract. Therefore the neighbor is merely an incidental beneficiary. 

B is incorrect because it is irrelevant to the issue presented. C is incorrect because, as explained above, the facts suggest that the neighbor is merely an incidental beneficiary. D is incorrect because only a party to a contract, an assignee, or an intended beneficiary has standing to enforce the contract.","Third-Party Rights"
"An art collector paid a gallery $1,000 to purchase a framed drawing from the gallery's collection. The price included shipping by the gallery to the collector's home.

When a seller has delivered nonconforming goods, and the buyer justifiably revokes acceptance, the buyer has a security interest in the goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price. The buyer may hold such goods and resell them in the same manner as an aggrieved seller. The buyer, in this case, becomes a person in the same position as a seller and has the same remedies as a seller. Therefore the buyer can resell the goods at either a public or private sale, the same way an aggrieved seller could. For these reasons, Answer D is incorrect.

A is incorrect. Although it is true that the buyer may resell goods at a private sale, this right only exists if the seller is given reasonable notice. Because this answer choice makes no reference to notice to the seller, Answer B is a more thorough choice than Answer A.

"A building owner and a purchaser made a written contract pursuant to which the building owner promised to convey a specified apartment house to the purchaser in return for the purchaser's promise (1) to convey a 100-acre farm to the building owner, and (2) to pay the building owner $1,000 in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm. The contract contained the following provision: ""It is understood and agreed that the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of said apartment house.""

Which of the following statements concerning the order of performances is LEAST accurate?",multiple-choice,"The building owner's tendering of good title to the apartment house is a condition precedent to the purchaser's duty to convey good title to the farm.","The purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm is a condition precedent to the building owner's duty to convey good title to the apartment house.","The purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm is a condition subsequent to the building owner's duty to convey good title to the apartment house.","The building owner's tendering of good title to the apartment house and the purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm are concurrent conditions.",,,3,"C is correct. This question deals with the distinction between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent, and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions that can occur together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. Therefore, each condition acts as a condition precedent to the other. Finally, a condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs. C is the least accurate statement because the purchaser's tendering of good title to the farm does not excuse the building owner's duty to convey good title to the apartment house.

Here, the building owner must convey the apartment to the purchaser, and at the same time the purchaser must convey the farm to the building owner, or no further duty arises for either party. After the purchaser conveys the farm (but no more than three months after), the building owner has a duty to remove the shed behind the apartment. Therefore, the building owner's conveyance of the apartment and the purchaser's tender of the farm are concurrent conditions, and in effect, each is a condition ""precedent"" to the other.

The subcontractor then breached by unjustifiably refusing to perform further. The contractor reasonably spent $120,000 to have the work completed by another subcontractor.

The subcontractor sues the contractor for the reasonable value of benefits conferred, and the contractor counterclaims for breach of contract.

Which of the following should be the court's decision?",multiple-choice,"The subcontractor recovers $50,000, the benefit conferred on the contractor for which the subcontractor has not been paid.","The subcontractor recovers $30,000, the benefit the subcontractor conferred on the contractor minus the $20,000 in damages incurred by the contractor.","The contractor recovers $20,000, the excess over the contract price that was paid by the contractor for the performance it had bargained to receive from the subcontractor.","Neither party recovers anything, because the subcontractor committed a material, unexcused breach and the contractor received a $50,000 benefit from the subcontractor for which the subcontractor has not been paid.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A party in breach generally is entitled to restitution of any benefit that he has conferred in the way of part performance in excess of any loss to the non-breaching party resulting from the breach. In measuring restitution to the breaching party, the value of the benefit conferred should not exceed the contract price for such services. The subcontractor appears to have entered into a losing contract, since the value of the services rendered up to the time of breach ($150,000) exceeds the contract rate for such services ($100,000). But because the subcontractor was the breaching party, he is not entitled to recover the amount by which the reasonable value of his services exceeded the contract rate; rather he is limited to restitution of what he would have earned on the contract.

Because the subcontractor has already been given progress payments of $100,000 for the work, there is no basis for restitution to the subcontractor. The contractor, however, is entitled to the damages resulting from the subcontractor's breach. Specifically, the contractor may recover the additional $20,000 cost of hiring another subcontractor to complete the work that the subcontractor refused to do.

"An amateur computer whiz agreed in writing to design three new games a year for a five-year period for a corporation that distributed TV game systems. The writing provided, in a clause separately signed by the computer whiz, that ""No modifications shall be binding on the corporation unless made in writing and signed by the corporation's authorized representative.""

Because of family problems, the computer whiz delivered and the corporation accepted only two game-designs a year for the first three years; but the games were a commercial success and the corporation made no objection. Accordingly, the computer whiz spent substantial sums on new computer equipment that would aid in speeding up future design work. In the first quarter of the fourth year, however, the corporation terminated the contract on the ground that the computer whiz had breached the annual-quantity term.

In the computer whiz's suit against the corporation for damages, the jury found that the contract had been modified by conduct and the trial court awarded the computer whiz substantial compensatory damages.

Is this result likely to be reversed on appeal?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the contract's no-oral-modification clause was not expressly waived by the corporation.","Yes, because the contract's no-oral-modification clause was a material part of the agreed exchange and could not be avoided without new consideration.","No, because the contract's no-oral-modification clause was unconscionable as against an amateur designer.","No, because the corporation by its conduct waived the annual-quantity term and the computer whiz materially changed his position in reasonable reliance on that waiver.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to a duty. Constructive conditions of exchange can be waived through conduct, by treating a breach as only a partial breach and continuing to perform the contract. Although a waiver may be retractable in certain situations, a waiver is not retractable once the non-waiving party has relied on the waiver. When the corporation accepted only two game-designs per year during the first three years of the contract, the corporation implicitly waived the computer whiz's breach of the annual-quantity term of the contract. The computer whiz relied on this waiver when he spent substantial sums on equipment for future design work. Therefore, it would be unjust to allow the corporation, without prior notice, to claim that the computer whiz breached the annual-quantity term in year four.

A contract may be rescinded on grounds of mutual mistake where the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract that has a material effect on the exchange, and where the party seeking rescission is found by the court not to bear the risk of the mistake. If in his first race after the sale, the horse dropped dead of a rare, undiscoverable heart condition, the trainer could make a plausible argument that the contract be rescinded on grounds of mistake. The condition related to a fundamental assumption (the horse's suitability for racing) that destroyed the subject matter of the contract, and since the heart condition was not expected or discoverable, a court might find that the trainer should not bear the risk of the mistake.

B and C are incorrect because neither of these factors relate to a fundamental assumption of the contract, since the facts suggest that the horse was purchased as a racehorse and not a breeder. D is incorrect because the risk that the horse might go beserk was one of which the trainer had notice, and was therefore a risk that he should bear.","Formation of Contracts"

A promise may be enforceable even if not bargained-for where: (i) the promisor should reasonably have expected the promise to induce reliance; (ii) there is reliance in fact; and (iii) enforcement of the promise is necessary to prevent injustice. Because the lender reviewed the plans for the project, the lender should reasonably have expected that its promise to lend would induce the developer to accept the bid and to tear down her old building. The substantial nature of the developer's reliance and the fact that she could not obtain financing elsewhere suggests that enforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid injustice.

A is incorrect. The lender's letter cannot reasonably be interpreted as an offer inviting such an acceptance. C is incorrect. A promise can be enforced on a detrimental reliance theory in the absence of a bargained-for exchange. D is incorrect.

When the friend exercised the option, he became obligated to purchase Broadacres for $325,000, and his failure to consummate his purchase entitled the neighbor to pursue remedies for breach of contract. Specific performance generally will be awarded for breach of contract where an award of monetary damages would be inadequate or impracticable. Contracts involving the sale of land historically have been regarded as unique, and therefore equitable relief traditionally has been allowed, even where the breaching party is the buyer.

"2. Sarah Seller, president and owner of Comps, a company that sells discounted computers, ordered 500 computer chips from Chippers, a manufacturer of computer chips.

On December 21, 2008, Chippers sent the shipment, which was delivered to Comps on December 23, 2008. Upon inspection by Sarah, 475 of the computer chips were in perfect condition, but there were some problems with the other 25, ranging from nicks to bent edges. Sarah, incredibly annoyed at what she saw as Chipper's shoddy shipping practices, decided she needed to send them a message.

The broad power of a buyer to reject is tempered by UCC §2-508, often called the “right to cure” section, which has two standards for cure based on when the rejection occurs. If the time in which the performance is due has not passed, the seller, with seasonable notice, can make a conforming tender by the date of performance as a matter of right (subsection 1). If the time for performance has passed, the seller with seasonable notice, may still cure within a reasonable time provided the seller reasonably expected the buyer to accept the original tender.

To resolve this case, ask whether a reasonable person would believe an offer had been made based on objective manifestations. If so, enforce the contract even if theofferor subjectively did not intend to contract.

Jeff visited Ron in the hospital and said, ""I will pay your medical expenses if you will promise not to sue me."" Ron said, ""Fine"". When Jeff failed to pay the expenses, Ron paid them and sued Jeff for breach of contract.

There's just one problem: Freeloader has no money. He decides to approach Sam Startup, a fellow surfer and millionaire, for a loan. However, he knows Startup won't lend him the money if he just makes an appointment to see him in his office. So, on Friday night at 11 P.M, Freeloader and his friend Mike Massive, a giant of a man and an ex-boxer, pay Startup a visit. Startup is surprised to see the pair so late at night. He initially says no to the idea, but over many hours he gets so beaten down, so tired, and so afraid for his life, that he agrees to meet Freeloader at the office of Startup's lawyer to consider the idea.

Undue influence is unfair persuasion of a party who is under the domination of the person exercising the persuasion. The degree of persuasion that is unfair depends on a variety of circumstances. The ultimate question is whether the result was produced by means that seriously impaired the free and competent exercise of judgment. Factors courts consider include the presence of one or more persuaders; discussions at an inappropriate location or time; statements by the dominant party that the weakened party cannot seek counsel or cannot delay in reaching an immediate agreement. If found, the agreement is voidable by the weakened party. Here, although many of the factors of undue influence are present, the delay in reaching the agreement and decision to seek counsel and meet in counsel's office probably defeats an undue influence defense.

"On March 31, a seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement in which the seller agreed to fabricate and sell to the buyer 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by the buyer. The contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the seller funds to ""tool up"" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer would pay the remaining balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the rest of the brake linings on June 30.

On May 10, the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however, the seller assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome, and the buyer paid the seller the first installment of the purchase price. The seller did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31, or at any time thereafter. On June 10, the seller notified that it would not perform the contract.

Which of the following correctly states the buyer's rights and obligations immediately after receipt of the seller's notice on May 10?",multiple-choice,"The buyer can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and has cause of action on May 10 for breach of the entire contract.","The buyer can treat the notice as an anticipatory repudiation, and can sue to enjoin an actual breach by the seller on May 31.","The buyer has no cause of action for breach of contract, but can suspend its performance and demand assurances that the seller will perform.","The buyer has no cause of action for breach of contract, and must pay the installment of the purchase price due on May 15 to preserve its rights under the contract.",,,3,"C is correct. Under the UCC, repudiation of a contractual obligation may be treated as a total breach of that obligation. In order to amount to repudiation, however, the statement must be unequivocal; a statement that merely expresses doubt over a party's ability or willingness to perform is not sufficient. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the other party's performance, the other may make a written demand for adequate assurances of performance and suspend return performance if commercially reasonable. Failure to respond to a justified demand for assurances is a repudiation of the contract. At the time of the buyer's receipt of the seller's notice on May 10, the seller had not repudiated the contract, as the notice only expressed doubt over whether performance was possible. The notice did, however, provide reasonable grounds for the buyer to demand adequate assurances of performance and to suspend its return performance.

A and B are incorrect. The May 10 notice was not an unequivocal expression of unwillingness or inability to perform. D is incorrect. The May 10 notice gave the buyer reasonable grounds for insecurity, and therefore the buyer would be justified in suspending the May 15 payment until such assurances are given.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On April 1, an owner and a buyer signed a writing in which the owner, in consideration of $100 to be paid to the owner by the buyer, offered the buyer the right to purchase Greenacre for $100,000 within 30 days. The writing further provided, ""This offer will become effective as an option only if and when the $100 consideration is in fact paid."" On April 20, the owner, having received no payment or other communication from the buyer, sold and conveyed Greenacre to a citizen for $120,000. On April 21, the owner received a letter from the buyer enclosing a cashier's check for $100 payable to the owner and stating, ""I am hereby exercising my option to purchase Greenacre and am prepared to close whenever you're ready.""

Which of the following, if proved, best support the buyer's suit against the owner for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"The buyer was unaware of the sale to the citizen when the owner received the letter and check from the buyer on April 21.","On April 15, the buyer decided to purchase Greenacre, and applied for and obtained a commitment from a bank for a $75,000 loan to help finance the purchase.","When the April 1 writing was signed, the owner said to the buyer, ""Don't worry about the $100; the recital of '$100 to be paid' makes this deal binding.""","The owner and the buyer are both professional dealers in real estate.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. An option promise, which makes an offer irrevocable during the time stated, requires consideration to be enforceable. Even if consideration is not furnished, however, the offer can be accepted by the offeree unless the offer lapses or the offeree receives notice of revocation by the offeror. Because the requested consideration had not been paid, the owner's April 1 letter was not effective as an option at the time that the owner conveyed Greenacre to the citizen. Because the offer was not set to lapse until April 30, the buyer was still free to accept the owner's offer on April 21, unless it could be shown that the buyer received notice that the owner conveyed Greenacre to a third party (which would have the effect of revoking the offer, because it demonstrates the owner's inability to enter into the contract).

B is incorrect because the buyer's reliance would not be reasonable under these circumstances; the buyer could have protected itself simply by paying the $100 to create an enforceable option. C is incorrect because most courts do not regard a mere recital of consideration as sufficient to create an option. D is incorrect because the parties' status as professionals is not relevant to whether the owner's offer was accepted in time.","Formation of Contracts"
"On November 1, an accountant and a lawyer contracted for the sale by the accountant to the lawyer of the law books the accountant had inherited from his father. The lawyer agreed to pay the purchase price of $10,000 when the accountant delivered the books on December 1.

If you want the stacks, I will deliver them to you along with the books on December 1 at no additional cost to you. Let me know before November 15 whether you want them. I will not sell them to anyone else before then."" On November 14, the lawyer faxed and the accountant received the following message: ""I accept your offer of the stacks."" The accountant was not a merchant with respect to either law books or book stacks.

The accountant is contractually obligated to deliver the stacks because",multiple-choice,"The lawyer provided a new bargained-for exchange by agreeing to take the stacks.","The accountant's letter (received by the lawyer on November 10) and the lawyer's fax-message of November 14 constituted an effective modification of the original sale-of-books contract.","The lawyer's fax-message of November 14 operated to rescind unilaterally the original sale-of-books contract.","The accountant's letter (received by the lawyer on November 10) waived the bargained-for consideration that would otherwise be required.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. This is a contract for the sale of goods, thus governed by the UCC. Under the UCC, modification of a contract for the sale of goods needs no additional consideration to be binding. When the accountant proposed on November 10 to supply the book stacks along with the law books at no additional cost, his offer proposed a unilateral modification of the contract, which the lawyer accepted before the offer lapsed. Because the contract involves a sale of goods (books), the modification is enforceable notwithstanding the lack of consideration. A is incorrect because the modification was gratuitous. C is incorrect because the lawyer's November 14 communication was merely an acceptance of the modification and did not discharge the original obligation.

The tutor agreed to do the work for $5,000, although the going rate was $6,000. Before the instruction was to begin and before any payment was made, the tutor repudiated the contract. Although the mother or the son reasonably could have employed, for $6,000, an equally qualified instructor to replace the tutor, neither did so. The son failed the bar exam, and the law firm refused to employ him. It can be shown that had the son received the tutor's instruction, he would have passed the bar exam.

The victim of a breach is entitled to recover only those damages which could not reasonably have been avoided. Failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages defeats only a claim for consequential damages. It does not deprive the victims of the breach of the opportunity to claim damages measured by the difference between contract and market price. Here, the mother and son could have paid just $1,000 more to hire a substitute teacher, and they are entitled to recover this amount — which is the amount necessary to put them in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed.

Answer B is incorrect because even though these damages might have been foreseeable, the losses were not CAUSED by the breach, since they could have been avoided had the plaintiff made reasonable efforts to mitigate damages.

Answer C is incorrect. Where two parties contract for a service that both parties intend to directly benefit a designated third party, both the third party beneficiary and the promisee are entitled to sue upon the promissor's breach. Here, the woman and the tutor both intended that the tutor's services benefit the woman's son. Upon the tutor's breach, therefore, both the woman and her son-—the intended beneficiary of the contract—-may sue for damages. Their failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages defeats only the claim for consequential damages. It does not deprive them of the opportunity to claim damages measured by the difference between contract and market price.

"A debtor's liquidated and undisputed $1,000 debt to a creditor was due on March 1.

The debtor orally agreed. On April 1, the creditor sued the debtor to collect the debt that had become due on March 1. The debtor moved to dismiss the creditor's complaint. 

Should the court grant the debtor's motion?",multiple-choice,"No, because there was no consideration to support the creditor's promise not to sue.","No, because there was no consideration to support the debtor's promise to pay $1,000 on December 1.","Yes, because a promise to allow a debtor to delay payment on a past debt is enforceable without consideration.","Yes, because the debtor bargained for the creditor's forbearance.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The law supports the settlement of debts and claims. However, consideration is required for a settlement to be enforceable. Under the preexisting duty rule, the creditor's promise to forbear from suing to collect was not supported by consideration from the debtor, because the amount due was liquidated and the debtor promised to do nothing more than he was already obligated to do. The creditor's promise was not supported by consideration from the debtor because it allowed for payment of an undisputed amount, $1,000, after the time for payment of the debt had passed. 

Answer B is incorrect. The creditor's promise to forbear from filing suit was sufficient consideration to support the debtor's promise. There was, however, no consideration from the debtor to support the creditor's promise, because the debtor promised nothing more than to pay an undisputed debt long after it was due. Thus, the creditor's promise to forbear is not enforceable. 

Answer C is incorrect. This is an incorrect statement of the rule of Foakes v. Beer and the preexisting duty rule that requires consideration to enforce a promise to allow a debtor to delay payment on an undisputed debt. Because the debtor provided no consideration for the creditor's promise to forbear from suing, that promise is not enforceable against the creditor. 

Answer D is incorrect. The debtor may have hoped that the creditor would forbear, but the debtor provided no consideration to support the creditor's forbearance Thus, the creditor's promise to forbear is not enforceable.","Formation of Contracts"

The farmer offered to prove that in the wheat business, a promise to deliver a specified quantity is considered to be satisfied if the delivered quantity is within 5% of the specified quantity. The buyer objected to the offered evidence.

Is the court likely to admit the evidence offered by the farmer?",multiple-choice,"No, because the offered evidence is inconsistent with the express language of the agreement.","No, because the written contract was totally integrated.","Yes, because the offered evidence demonstrates that the farmer substantially performed the contract.","Yes, because the offered evidence explains or supplements the agreement by usage of trade.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. This transaction involves a sale of goods and is subject to UCC Article 2. Under Article 2, evidence of trade usage that can be construed as reasonably consistent with an agreement's express language is admissible to interpret or supplement an agreement. The majority rule provides that trade usage will be viewed as consistent with an agreement's express language unless the usage completely negates specific express language. The trade usage allowing for a variation of up to 5% does not completely negate but rather qualifies the express language calling for the delivery of 100,000 bushels of wheat. Thus, Answer D is correct and Answer A is incorrect. Answer B is incorrect because the rule stated above applies regardless of whether the written agreement is a complete integration.

Answer C is incorrect. Under UCC § 2-601, the applicable standard for determining breach of a non-installment transaction involving a sale of goods is the perfect tender rule and not the substantial performance standard. However, the offered evidence of trade usage would establish that there was no breach; according to the trade usage standards, the farmer's delivery of 96,000 bushels was performance that conformed to the agreement.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A new business enterprise about to commence the manufacture of clothing entered into a written agreement to purchase all of its monthly requirements of a certain elasticized fabric for a period of three years from a fabric company at a specified unit price and agreed delivery and payment terms. The agreement also provided:

1. The parties covenant not to assign this contract.

2. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company.

The fabric company promptly made an ""assignment of the contract"" to a finance company as security for a $100,000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered, took delivery of, and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5,000) for the new enterprise's requirement of the fabric for the first month of its operation.

Two weeks after making the $5,000 payment to the fabric company, the new business enterprise, by written notice to the fabric company, terminated the agreement for purchase of the elasticized fabric because market conditions had in fact forced the new business enterprise out of the clothing manufacture business. In an immediate suit by the finance company against the new business enterprise for total breach, which of the following would be useful in the new business enterprise's defense?",multiple-choice,"The fabric company's rights under its agreement with the new business enterprise were personal and therefore nonassignable.","The fabric company's ""assignment of the contract"" to the finance company to secure a loan would normally be interpreted as a delegation of the fabric company's duties under the contract as well as an assignment of its rights; and its duties, owed to the new business enterprise, were personal and therefore non-delegable.","The original contract between the new business enterprise and the fabric company was unenforceable by either party for want of legally sufficient consideration for the fabric company's promise to supply the new business enterprise's requirements of the elasticized fabric.","the new business enterprise ceased in good faith to have any further requirements for elasticized fabric.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A party's obligations under a requirements contract subject to the UCC are measured by good faith. A shut-down by a requirements buyer due to lack of orders or market conditions meets the good faith standard.

A is incorrect because unless there are circumstances suggesting otherwise, a clause prohibiting the assignment of the ""contract"" will be construed as barring only the delegation of the assignor's duties. See UCC §2-210. Therefore, the clause would not affect the assignment of payment made by the fabric company to the finance company. Furthermore, a party's contractual right is only personal where the nature of the contract is such that the assignment would impair the other party's reasonable expectations or would offend public policy. Assignment of a right to payment of money is not the assignment of a personal right.

B is incorrect because the ""assignment of the contract"" was expressly made to a creditor of the fabric company. Rights are assigned and duties are delegated. The use of ""assignment"" language, and the fact that the assignment was made to a creditor, reasonably indicates that the fabric company did not delegate its duties under the contract. C is incorrect because consideration exists in the form of a legal detriment to the new business enterprise as the enterprise has parted with the legal right to buy elasticized fabric from another source.","Formation of Contracts"
"A landholder was land-rich by inheritance but money-poor, having suffered severe losses on bad investments, but still owned several thousand acres of unencumbered timberland. He had a large family, and his normal, fixed personal expenses were high. Pressed for cash, he advertised a proposed sale of standing timber on a choice 2,000-acre tract. The only response was an offer by a logger, the owner of a large, integrated construction enterprise, after inspection of the advertised tract.

The logger offered to buy, sever, and remove the standing timber from the advertised tract at a cash price 70% lower than the regionally prevailing price for comparable timber rights. The landholder, by then in desperate financial straits and knowing little about timber values, signed and delivered to the logger a letter accepting the offer.

If, before the logger commences performance, the landholder's investment fortunes suddenly improve and he wishes to get out of the timber deal with the logger, which of the following legal concepts affords his best prospect of effective cancellation?",multiple-choice,"Bad faith.","Equitable estoppel.",Unconscionability.,Duress.,,,3,"Answer C is correct. Where a court finds a contract to be unconscionable at the time that the contract is made, it may refuse to enforce the contract or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable term. Unconscionability has been defined as including both procedural and substantive elements: procedural unconscionability refers to defects in the bargaining process that leave a party with no meaningful choice, and substantive unconscionability refers to contract terms that are unreasonably favorable to the other party.

When viewed in light of the situation existing at the time that the contract was made, it appears that both elements are present here: the landholder was in desperate financial straits and ignorant of the value of the rights that he was selling, and the terms of the contract grant timber rights to the logger for a price that is 70% below the market rate. A is incorrect because the mere fact that the logger won the contract with a below-market bid does not suggest bad faith. B is incorrect because there is no evidence of a statement of fact that would give rise to an estoppel. D is incorrect because, in order to show duress, the landholder would need to show that the logger induced the landholder to make the contract by making a wrongful threat (which on these facts the logger did not do).","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A corporation, through its president, requested from a financing company a short-term loan of $100,000. On April 1, the corporation's president and the financing company's loan officer agreed orally that the financing company would make the loan on the following terms: (1) The loan would be repaid in full on or before the following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the applicable usury law), and (2) the corporation's president would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by the financing company and signed by the president of the corporation, that read in its entirety:
""April 5

In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, the corporation hereby promises to pay the financing company, $100,000 on September 1.

The corporation

By /s/ the president""
The corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds to do so. On July 10, the financing company sued the corporation as principal debtor and the corporation's president individually as guarantor for $100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5.

At the trial, can the financing company prove the president's oral promise to guarantee the loan?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the president signed the memorandum.","Yes, because, as president of the debtor company, the president is a third-party beneficiary of the loan.","No, because there was no separate consideration for the president's promise.","No, because such proof is barred by the statute of frauds.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The Statute of Frauds requires that agreements to act as a surety or to guarantee the debt of another, when there has not been a novation, are within the statute and require a writing.

A is incorrect because the written memorandum does not mention the president's oral promise to guarantee the corporation's debt. B is incorrect because the contract was not made to benefit the president or create enforcement rights in him. C is incorrect because the president's personal guarantee may have been necessary to obtain the loan, and because the two agreements were made simultaneously, separate consideration may not be required.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A borrower owed a lender $50,000 due on March 1. On January 10, the lender telephoned the borrower and said that he would discharge the debt if the borrower would promise to pay the lender $45,000 by January 15. The borrower responded, ""I will attempt to get the money together."" On January 11, the lender again telephoned the borrower and said that he had changed his mind and would expect the borrower to make full payment on March 1. On January 15, the borrower tendered $45,000 as full payment, which the lender refused to accept. On March 1, the borrower refused the lender's demand for $50,000, and the lender sued for that amount. 

Which of the following statements best supports the lender's position?",multiple-choice,"The borrower's January 10 statement was not a return promise, and therefore the lender effectively revoked his offer on January 11.","The January 10 telephone conversation between the lender and the borrower created an executory accord and therefore did not operate as a discharge of the $50,000 debt.","The lender's offer to discharge the debt was a gift promise and therefore was not binding on the lender.","The lender's promise to discharge the $50,000 debt was not enforceable because it was not in writing.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The lender's offer requested that the borrower accept by making a return promise. The borrower's response to the lender's offer was a statement of intention, which was not sufficiently promissory to constitute acceptance of an offer and create a binding contract. The mutual assent required for an enforceable executory accord did not arise from the January 10 conversation between the lender and the borrower. Therefore the lender effectively revoked his offer on January 11. Thus, Answer A is correct and Answer B is incorrect.

Answer C is incorrect. An offer in which a creditor promises to accept a payment for less than the amount owed prior to the due date is sufficient consideration to support a return promise by a borrower accepting the offer. Moreover, the dispositive issue is not whether there was consideration but whether the borrower's response to the lender's offer was an acceptance. The borrower's response to the lender's offer was a statement of intention, which was not sufficiently promissory to constitute acceptance of an offer and create a binding contract.

Answer D is incorrect. The purported contract between the lender and the borrower was not a transaction that would fall within a statute of frauds. Moreover, the dispositive issue is not compliance with the statute of frauds but whether the borrower's response to the lender's offer was sufficiently promissory to constitute an acceptance.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A farmer leased in writing a 100-acre farm from a landowner for five years at $2,000 per year, with an option to purchase ""five acres of the land for $10,000 cash"" at the end of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the landowner orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. The farmer took possession of the farm and paid for the rent for five years. During the fifth year, having decided that he would exercise the purchase option, the farmer planted several fruit trees and built a large grain silo on the property. At the end of the term, the farmer tendered the landowner $10,000 and demanded a conveyance, but the landowner repudiated the option agreement and retook possession of the farm. He had never had the five-acre parcel surveyed.

The landowner is not liable to the farmer for breach of land-sale contract. In an action by the farmer against the landowner for the reasonable value of the improvements that the farmer added to the farm, which of the following theories would best support the farmer's claim?",multiple-choice,"Quasi-contract, for benefits inofficiously and non-gratuitously conferred upon the landowner by the farmer","Tort, for conversion by the landowner in retaking possession of the improvements","Breach of trust by the landowner as trustee of a resulting trust of the improvements","Breach by the landowner of an implied-in-fact promise (manifested by his retaking possession of the farm and improvements) to compensate the farmer for the improvements",,,1,"A is correct. The benefits (planting trees and building a grain silo) were not done officiously or gratuitously because at the time the farmer did these things, he reasonably believed that he could exercise his option to purchase a five-acre portion of the farm, which he could only exercise at the end of the lease.

B is incorrect. The landowner did not exercise wrongful dominion or control by retaking possession of his land with the improvements on it.

C is incorrect. Resulting trusts are decreed when a defendant holds legal title to property that is properly treated as the plaintiff's. If the landowner is not liable to the farmer for breach of the land sale contract, by retaking possession of his land, the landowner has not breached any resulting trust.

D is incorrect. A contract is implied in fact when the words, conduct, and all surrounding circumstances evince the parties' intent to create a contractual obligation. The fact that the landowner gained possession is not enough to evidence a contractual intent to compensate the farmer for the improvements.",Remedies
"On January 15, in a signed writing, an artist agreed to remodel a building owner's building according to certain specifications, and the owner to pay the agreed price of $5,000 to the artist's niece as a birthday present. The niece did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5.

Before they signed the writing, the artist and the owner had orally agreed that their ""written agreement will be null and void unless the owner is able to obtain a $5,000 loan from the bank before January 31.""

The owner obtained the loan, the artist completed the remodeling on May 1, and on May 3, at the artist's request, the owner paid the $5,000 to the artist. If the niece learns of the owner's payment to the artist on May 5 at the same time she learns of the written artist-owner contract, will she succeed in action against the owner for $5,000?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because she is an intended beneficiary of the written artist-owner contract.","Yes, because the written artist-owner contract operated as an assignment to the niece, and the artist thereby lost whatever rights he may have had to the $5,000.","No, because the niece had not furnished any consideration to support the owner's promise to pay $5,000 to her.","No, because on May 3, the artist and the owner effectively modified their written contract, thereby depriving the niece of whatever right she may have had under that contract.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Prior to the modification, the niece had no knowledge and thus no reliance on her status as a third-party beneficiary under the contract. As such, her rights had not vested. For these reasons A is incorrect. B is incorrect because payment to the niece was set forth in the original agreement as a gift. An assignment, on the other hand, involves the transfer of rights under an existing contract. C is also incorrect because an intended beneficiary, even if gratuitous, need not supply consideration in order to enforce a right to recovery. All that is necessary is that the right vest.","Third-Party Rights"
"A written construction contract, under which a contractor agreed to build a new house for an owner at a fixed price of $200,000, contained the following provision:
Prior to construction or during the course thereof, this contract may be modified by mutual agreement of the parties as to ""extras"" or other departures from the plans and specifications provided by the owner and attached hereto. Such modifications, however, may be authorized only in writing, signed by both parties.
During construction, the contractor incorporated into the structure overhanging gargoyles and other ""extras"" orally requested by the owner for orally agreed prices in addition to the contract price. The owner subsequently refused to pay anything for such extras, aggregating $30,000 at the agreed prices, solely on the ground that no written, signed authorization for them was ever effected.

If the contractor sues the owner on account of the ""extras,"" which, if any, of the following will effectively support the owner's defense?",multiple-choice,"The parol evidence rule.","The preexisting duty rule.","Failure of an express condition.","The owner does not have a valid defense.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A provision in a written contract that specifies that any modification to the agreement is unenforceable unless made in writing and signed by both parties is referred to as a no-oral-modification clause. Such clauses are common in construction contracts (such as the owner-contractor agreement) and may be enforceable unless the contractor has relied on a verbal request for extras (as was done in this case).

None of the rules listed provides an effective defense for the owner. A is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not apply to modifications made after the adoption of a final writing. B is incorrect because the pre-existing duty rule (which requires that modifications be supported by consideration) is not relevant to the owner's claim that a written authorization was required. C is incorrect because an argument based on express conditions could be rebutted by showing that the parties effectively waived the condition by entering into a verbal agreement which the contractor relied upon.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city. In early 2007 the city's City Council adopted this resolution:

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here.
The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 ""for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire."" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward.

Revocation of general offers made to the public must be given publicity equal to that given to the offer and no better means of notification should be reasonably available. If the offer is not revoked, as with ordinary offers, a general offer will lapse after a reasonable time. A is incorrect because the offer was also revocable and there are no facts to support that December 31st was a reasonable time as to lapse. B is incorrect because the rules of lapse also apply to general offers made to the public. C is incorrect because general offers may be revoked so long as the revocation is given publicity equal to that given the offer and no better means of notification of revocation is reasonably available.","Formation of Contracts"
"A landowner contracted in a signed writing to sell Greenacre, a 500-acre tract of farmland, to a farmer. The contract provided for exchange of the deed and purchase price of $500,000 in cash on January 15. Possession was to be given to the farmer on the same date. On January 15, landowner notified the farmer that because the tenant on Greenacre wrongfully refused to quit the premises until January 30, the landowner would be unable to deliver possession of Greenacre until then, but he assured the farmer that he would tender the deed and possession on that date. Throughout the month of January, the market value of Greenacre was $510,000, and its fair monthly rental value was $5,000.

On January 30, the farmer accepted a conveyance and possession of Greenacre and paid the $500,000 purchase price, but notified the landowner that he was reserving any rights he might have to damages caused by the landowner's breach. The farmer intended to use the land for raising cattle and had entered into a contract for the purchase of 500 head of cattle to be delivered to Greenacre on January 15. Because he did not have possession of Greenacre on that date, he had to rent another pasture at a cost of $2,000 to graze the cattle for 15 days. The landowner had no reason to know that the farmer intended to use Greenacre for raising cattle or that he was purchasing cattle to be grazed on Greenacre.

In an action by the farmer against the landowner for damages, the farmer is entitled to recover",multiple-choice,"nothing, because by paying the purchase price on January 30, he waived whatever cause of action he may have had.","nominal damages only, because the market value of the land exceeded the contract price.","$2,500 only (the fair rental value of Greenacre for 15 days).","$2,500 (the fair rental value of Greenacre for 15 days), plus $2,000 (the cost of grazing the cattle elsewhere for 15 days).",,,3,"C is correct. Where a partial breach of contract occurs, the non-breaching party remains obligated to perform the contract but may recover damages for the partial breach. Consequential damages for breach of contract are limited to those that the breaching party had reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach at the time that the contract was made. When the landowner delivered possession of Greenacre 15 days after the time specified in the contract, he committed a partial breach, entitling the farmer to damages for the loss to him resulting from the delay. Because the landowner had no reason to know of the farmer's intended use of the land, the landowner is not obligated to pay damages for the cost of renting another pasture. The landowner is, however, obligated to pay the fair rental value of Greenacre for the 15-day period of delay.

A is incorrect. The farmer reserved his rights to claim damages for partial breach. B is incorrect. The market value of Greenacre relative to the contract price is not relevant to determining damages for delay in delivery of possession. D is incorrect. The $2,000 cost of renting another pasture was not reasonably foreseeable to the landowner and therefore not recoverable as consequential damages.",Remedies
"On March 1, a seller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to a buyer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. The buyer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a debt which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor.

On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed in $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the creditor.

Which of the following would be most important in deciding an action by the creditor against the buyer for $25,000?",multiple-choice,"Whether the buyer-seller agreement was completely integrated.","Whether the buyer was negligent in not having carefully read the written agreement.","Whether the seller was negligent in not having carefully read the written agreement.","Whether the creditor was a party to the contract.",,,1,"A is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). The buyer and the seller entered into a final written agreement that was silent with respect to the verbal promise that the creditor seeks to enforce (the buyer's promise to repay the seller's debt). Because the writing was silent with respect to this, the creditor seeks to supplement, rather than contradict, the writing with extrinsic evidence of the promise. Therefore, whether the promise will be admissible hinges on whether the writing was a complete integration.

B and C are incorrect. The parol evidence rule may apply to exclude evidence of the promise regardless of whether the parties were negligent in reading the final writing. D is incorrect. Even if the creditor was not a party to the contract, the creditor may be able to recover as an intended third-party beneficiary.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A borrower asked a lender to lend her $1,000. The lender replied that he would do so only if the borrower's father would guarantee the loan. At the borrower's request, the father mailed a signed letter to the lender: ""If you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't."" On September 15, the lender, having read the father's letter, lent $1,000 to the borrower, which the borrower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31. The father died on September 16. Later that same day, unaware of the father's death, the lender mailed a letter to the father advising that he had made the $1,000 loan to the borrower on September 15.

The borrower did not pay the installments due on October 31, November 30, or December 31, and has informed the lender that she will be unable to make repayments in the foreseeable future.

On January 15, the lender is entitled to a judgment against the borrower for which of the following amounts?",multiple-choice,"Nothing, because if he sues before the entire amount is due, he will be splitting his cause of action.","$300 plus the accrued interest, because the borrower's breach is only a partial breach.","$1,000 plus the accrued interest, because the borrower's unexcused failure to pay three installments is a material breach.","$1,000 plus the accrued interest, because the failure to pay her debts as they come due indicates that the borrower is insolvent and the lender is thereby entitled to accelerate payment of the debt.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that obligation and give rise to a right to immediately recover damages for that breach. A repudiation of a duty will not operate as a total breach, however, if it occurs after the repudiating party has received all of the agreed exchange for that duty. In such a case, the non-repudiating party must wait until the obligation becomes due before enforcing it. Although the borrower failed to make three repayments of the debt and expressed her inability to repay the debt in the future, the lender cannot accelerate the debt unless the contract specified otherwise. Therefore, the lender can only recover for the three months of unpaid debt that is due and outstanding as of January 15.

Answer A is incorrect because the lender can recover the amount that is due as of January 15. Answer C is incorrect because the breach will be treated as a partial breach. Answer D is incorrect because the debt may not be accelerated unless the contract expressly so provides.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"

As such, it is fair to put the burden of the loss on the offeror. The mailbox rule is applicable only to acceptances.

"On June 15, a teacher accepted a contract for a one-year position teaching math at a public high school at a salary of $50,000, starting in September. On June 22, the school informed the teacher that, due to a change in its planned math curriculum, it no longer needed a full-time math teacher. The school offered instead to employ the teacher as a part-time academic counselor at a salary of $20,000, starting in September. The teacher refused the school's offer. On June 29, the teacher was offered a one-year position to teach math at a nearby private academy for $47,000, starting in September. The teacher, however, decided to spend the year completing work on a graduate degree in mathematics and declined the academy's offer.

Here, the teacher's damages of $50,000 should be reduced by the $47,000 she would have earned if she had accepted the comparable teaching position at the private academy. Therefore, the teacher is entitled to recover $3,000 from the school.

In the case of a wrongfully discharged employee, the employee is expected to accept an offer of comparable employment. If the employee fails or refuses to do so, the employee's recovery is reduced by the amount of the loss that the employee could have avoided by accepting comparable employment.

"On November 15, a contractor, in a signed writing, contracted with a homeowner for an agreed price to personally remodel the homeowner's kitchen according to specifications provided by the homeowner and to start work on December 1. The contractor agreed to provide all materials for the job in addition to all of the labor required.

Assume that on November 26 the contractor without legal excuse repudiated the contract and that the homeowner, after a reasonable and prolonged effort, could not find anyone to remodel his kitchen for a price approximating the price agreed to by the contractor.

If one year later the homeowner brings an action for specific performance against the contractor, which of the following will provide the contractor with the best defense?",multiple-choice,"An action for equitable relief not brought within a reasonable time is barred by laches.","Specific performance is generally not available as a remedy to enforce a contractual duty to perform personal services.","Specific performance is generally not available as a remedy in the case of an anticipatory repudiation.","Specific performance is not available as a remedy where even nominal damages could have been recovered as a remedy at law.",,,2,"B is correct. Specific performance will generally be awarded for breach of contract where monetary damages would be inadequate or impracticable. However, a court will not issue an affirmative injunction compelling a person to specifically perform a personal service contract (although a court might issue a negative injunction in certain circumstances). Because the contractor-homeowner contract obligates the contractor to personally remodel the homeowner's kitchen, it is a personal service contract that is not specifically enforceable.

A is incorrect. There is no evidence that the homeowner's delay in bringing the action prejudiced the contractor, so laches will not provide a defense. C and D are incorrect.

"A producer contracted to pay an inexperienced performer a specified salary to act in a small role in a play the producer was taking on a six-week road tour. The contract was for the duration of the tour. On the third day of the tour, the performer was hospitalized with a stomach disorder. The producer replaced her in the cast with an experienced actor.

After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the period that the performer's illness prevented her from acting. The critical issue here is whether the producer also had the right to cancel the contract. Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the extent to which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing the tour. The relative quality of the actor's performance is not a circumstance that would give the producer the right to cancel the performer's contract. 

B is correct. After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the period that the performer's illness prevented her from acting. The critical issue here is whether the producer also had the right to cancel the contract. Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel the contract include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the extent to which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing the tour. The unwillingness of the actor, the only replacement available, to take a contract for less than the remainder of the six-week tour and the uncertainty surrounding when the performer might return to work would have discharged the producer's performance obligations and justified his cancellation of the contract with the performer. 

C is incorrect. After the performer became ill, the temporary impracticability doctrine excused the performer's contractual obligation and also gave the producer the right to suspend his performance obligation during the period that the performer's illness prevented her from acting.

Circumstances that would give the producer the right to cancel include the degree of uncertainty relating to the nature and duration of the performer's illness and the extent to which a delay in making substitute arrangements would have prevented the producer from continuing the tour.

"On January 5, a creditor lent $1,000 to a debtor under a contract calling for the debtor to repay the loan at the rate of $100 per month payable on the first day of each month. On February 1, at the debtor's request, the creditor agreed to permit payment on February 5. On March 1, the debtor requested a similar time extension and the creditor replied, ""Don't bother me each month. Just change the date of payment to the fifth of the month. But you must now make the payments by cashier's check."" The debtor said, ""Okay,"" and made payments on March 5 and April 5. On April 6, the creditor sold the loan contract to a bank, but did not tell the bank about the agreement permitting payments on the fifth of the month. On April 6, the bank wrote to the debtor: ""Your debt to [the creditor] has been assigned to us. We hereby inform you that all payments must be made on the first day of the month.""

Can the debtor justifiably insist that the payment date for the rest of the installments is the fifth of each month?",multiple-choice,"No, because a contract modification is not binding on an assignee who had no knowledge of the modification.","No, because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month, the bank reinstated it.","Yes, because although the creditor waived the condition of payment on the first of the month, the creditor could not assign to the bank his right to reinstate that condition.","Yes, because the creditor could assign to the bank only those rights the creditor had in the contract at the time of the assignment.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. An assignee succeeds to a contract as the contract stands at the time of the assignment. In this case, the parties had modified the contract as to the time payment was due. (Note that there was consideration for the promise to accept payments later; the consideration was the debtor's promise to make future payments by cashier's check.) Accordingly, the debtor can insist that the payments be due on the fifth of each month.

Answer A is incorrect. This answer implies the existence of a rule which would make a contract modification ineffective where an assignee had no notice of it—-but there is no such rule. As explained above, the assignee bank in this case succeeded to the contract as it stood at the time of the assignment.

Answer B is incorrect. It is true that if a party waives a condition, that party may reinstate the condition with respect to future acts of performance, but that rule is not applicable here. The assignee bank in this case succeeded to the contract as it stood at the time of the assignment. The parties had modified the contract by mutual agreement, changing the term which specified the time payments were due, and the opportunity to reinstate a condition was no longer available. That is, this case raises an issue of modification of terms, and not a mere waiver. (Note that there was consideration for the promise to accept payments later; the consideration was the debtor's promise to make future payments by cashier's check.) Accordingly, the debtor can insist that the payments be due on the fifth of each month.

Answer C is incorrect. It is true that the debtor in this case can insist that the payments be due on the fifth of each month, but this answer misstates the reason why this is so. An assignee succeeds to a contract as the contract stands at the time of the assignment. In this case, the parties had modified the contract by mutual agreement prior to its assignment to the bank, changing the term which specified the time payments were due. (Note that there was consideration for the promise to accept payments later; the consideration was the debtor's promise to make future payments by cashier's check.) This is not a case where the creditor has waived prompt payment under the contract—-the parties mutually agreed to modify the contract. Moreover, if there had been no modification, but simply a waiver of the due date by the creditor, then the assignee bank would have had the right to reinstate the condition that payments be made on the first of the month.","Third-Party Rights"
"A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim ""to pay from any settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries."" The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were ""non-assignable."" The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from the doctor, but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise.

After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote the doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney.

The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor. The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor. The victim remains insolvent.

In an action by the doctor against the colleague, the colleague is most likely to argue on these facts that",multiple-choice,"the colleague made only a gratuitous promise to the attorney.","at the time the colleague promised to represent the victim, the doctor was only a member of an unidentified class of beneficiaries.","there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the doctor was either a creditor or donee beneficiary of the colleague's promise to the attorney.","there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the doctor substantially changed his position in reliance on the colleague's promise.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. A party will be found to be an intended beneficiary where recognition of standing to enforce the promise is appropriate to effectuate the intent of the parties and where the beneficiary is either a creditor beneficiary (where performance of the promise will satisfy a debt of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary) or a donee beneficiary (where the promisee intends to give the beneficiary the benefit of the performance). If anything, the doctor is merely an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the colleague and the victim, since the colleague's promise to represent the victim in his action against the driver neither satisfies the victim's debt to the doctor nor does it relate to any intent on the victim's part to confer a benefit on the doctor.

A is incorrect because the colleague's promise to represent the victim was implicitly made in exchange for payment from the victim for services rendered. B is incorrect because the better response is stated in answer C (that the doctor cannot show that he is a donee or creditor beneficiary of the colleague's promise). D is incorrect because any reliance by the doctor on the colleague's promise would not be reasonable, as he cannot show that he is an intended beneficiary of that promise.","Third-Party Rights"

Assume that no other correspondence passed between the retailer and the lawyer until the following April 15 (four months later), when the retailer received from the lawyer a faxed order for ""100 reams of your paper, catalog item #101.""

Did the lawyer's April 15 fax constitute an effective acceptance of the retailer's offer at the prices specified in the catalog?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the retailer had not revoked its offer before April 15.","Yes, because a one-year option contract had been created by the retailer's offer.","No, because under applicable law the irrevocability of the retailer's offer was limited to a period of three months.","No, because the lawyer did not accept the retailer's offer within a reasonable time.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Under the UCC's firm offer rule, an offer by a merchant for the sale of goods contained in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it is firm will be irrevocable, notwithstanding lack of consideration, for the time stated in the offer (or if no time is stated, for a reasonable time), but in no case may the period of irrevocability exceed three months. If the three-month period lapses and no consideration is given to support an option, then the offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance (or before it lapses). Because the retailer's firm offer was not supported by consideration, it became revocable as of March 15. However, the lawyer accepted the offer before the retailer revoked it and before the offer lapsed (because the offer stated that it would be open for the entire year); therefore, the retailer is bound to a contract to supply the paper.

B is incorrect because a firm offer becomes revocable after three months unless consideration is given to support an option. C is incorrect because notwithstanding the three-month limit on irrevocability, the lawyer accepted before the retailer revoked the offer. D is incorrect because the terms of the offer stated that it would be open for a year.","Formation of Contracts"
"A wallpaper hanger sent a general contractor, this telegram:
Will do all paperhanging on new Doctors' Building, per owner's specs, for $14,000 if you accept within reasonable time after main contract awarded.

/s/ the wallpaper hanger
Three other competing hangers sent the general contractor similar bids in the respective amounts of $18,000, $19,000, and $20,000. The general contractor used the wallpaper hanger's $14,000 figure in preparing and submitting her own sealed bid on Doctors' Building. Before the bids were opened, the wallpaper hanger truthfully advised the general contractor that the former's telegraphic sub-bid had been based on a $4,000 computational error and was therefore revoked. Shortly thereafter, the general contractor was awarded the Doctors' Building construction contract and subsequently contracted with another paperhanger for a price of $18,000. The general contractor now sues the wallpaper hanger to recover $4,000.

Which of the following, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor's prospect of recovery?",multiple-choice,"After the wallpaper hanger's notice of revocation, the general contractor made a reasonable effort to subcontract with another paperhanger at the lowest possible price.","The general contractor had been required by the owner to submit a bid bond and could not have withdrawn or amended her bid on the main contract without forfeiting that bond.","The wallpaper hanger was negligent in erroneously calculating the amount of his sub-bid.","The general contractor dealt with all of her subcontractors in good faith and without seeking to renegotiate (lower) the prices they had bid.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Unless the promisor has given an option promise supported by consideration, generally an offer is freely revocable until the time of acceptance. However, an offer may be irrevocable to the extent necessary to avoid injustice if the offeror should reasonably expect the offer to induce substantial reliance on the part of the offeree and where there is reliance in fact. The terms of the wallpaper hanger's offer suggest that the wallpaper hanger expected the general contractor to rely on his bid by utilizing it in calculating the general contractor's overall bid, and the general contractor in fact did rely on his bid. The fact that the general contractor was required to submit a bid bond to guarantee her bid demonstrates the substantial nature of the general contractor's reliance, because it shows the general contractor cannot pass the additional wallpapering cost on to the owner. Therefore this fact, if proved, would most strengthen the general contractor's case for recovery.

A, C and D are incorrect because, although each of these factors (mitigation of damages, the wallpaper hanger's negligence and the general contractor's good faith) may weigh in the general contractor's favor, the wallpaper hanger revoked her bid prior to the general contractor's acceptance. Therefore the general contractor cannot recover from the wallpaper hanger for breach of contract unless she can demonstrate that the wallpaper hanger's bid was irrevocable on a reliance theory.","Formation of Contracts"
"A woman owns an exceptionally seaworthy boat that she charters for sport fishing at a $500 daily rate. The fee includes the use of the boat with the woman as the captain, and one other crew member, as well as fishing tackle and bait. On May 1, a father agreed with the woman that the father would have the full-day use of the boat on May 15 for himself and his family for $500. The father paid an advance deposit of $200 and signed an agreement that the deposit could be retained by the woman as liquidated damages in the event the father canceled or failed to appear.

On May 15 at 1 a.m., the Coast Guard had issued offshore ""heavy weather"" warnings and prohibited all small vessels the size of the woman's from leaving the harbor. This prohibition remained in effect throughout the day. The father did not appear at all on May 15, because he had heard the weather warnings on his radio.

A contract may be rescinded on grounds of supervening impossibility where a party's performance is made impossible without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. Where a contract has been rescinded on grounds of supervening impossibility, a party may obtain restitution of any benefit conferred by way of part performance of the contract. Because the Coast Guard prohibited vessels such as the woman's from leaving the harbor on the afternoon of May 15 as a consequence of bad weather, performance of the woman-father contract was rendered impossible, and the father should successfully obtain restitution of the $200 deposit.

B is incorrect. The impossibility of performance was due to a supervening event (the occurrence of inclement weather on May 15) and not a mistake of the parties at the time of the contract (May 1). C is incorrect. The Coast Guard's prohibition effectively prevents the woman from performing the contract. D is incorrect. The liquidated damages clause cannot be construed as an allocation of risk of bad weather, as it specifies that the deposit is to be retained by the woman only in the event of breach by the father.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"While waiting in line to open an account with a bank, a customer read a poster on the bank's wall that said, ""New Customers! $25 FOR 5 MINUTES. If you stand in line for more than five minutes, we will pay you $25! We like happy customers!"" The customer started timing his wait and just as five minutes was about to pass, the bank manager tore the poster down and announced, ""The $25 stand-in-line promotion is over."" The customer waited in line for 10 more minutes before being served. 

Does the customer have a claim against the bank for $25?",multiple-choice,"No, because the bank withdrew its offer before the customer completed the requested performance.","No, because the bank's statement was a nonbinding gift promise.","Yes, because the bank could not revoke its offer once the customer had commenced performance.","Yes, because the customer's presence in line served as notice to the bank that he had accepted.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 45 provides that where an offer invites acceptance by performance, the offeree’s beginning of performance creates an option contract which precludes the offeror from revoking its offer. Because the customer had begun his wait before the poster was taken down and because he ended up standing in line for more than five minutes, the bank should be liable for the $25.

Answer A is incorrect. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 45 prevents an offeror from withdrawing its offer for a unilateral contract once the offeree has begun to perform. Once the customer was in line, the bank could no longer withdraw the offer, and therefore the bank should be liable for the $25.

Answer B is incorrect. The consideration required for an enforceable contract is present. The bank's promise to pay the customer $25 and the customer's standing in line constituted a bargained-for exchange.

Answer D is incorrect. The customer's mere presence in line constituted the beginning of performance but not the requested acceptance—standing in line for more than five minutes, which he eventually did. Because the customer had begun his wait before the poster was taken down and because he ended up standing in line for more than five minutes, the bank should be liable for the $25.","Formation of Contracts"
"A radio manufacturer and a retailer, after extensive negotiations, entered into a final written agreement in which the manufacturer agreed to sell and the retailer agreed to buy all of its requirements of radios, estimated at 20 units per month, during the period January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1990, at a price of $50 per unit. A dispute arose in December, 1990, when the retailer returned 25 undefective radios to the manufacturer for full credit after the manufacturer had refused to extend the contract for a second three-year period.

In an action by the manufacturer against the retailer for damages due to return of the 25 radios, the manufacturer introduces the written agreement, which expressly permitted the buyer to return defective radios for credit but was silent as to the return of undefective radios for credit. The retailer seeks to introduce evidence that during the three years of the agreement it had returned, for various reasons, 125 undefective radios, for which the manufacturer had granted full credit. The manufacturer objects to the admissibility of this evidence.

The trial court will probably rule that the evidence proffered by the retailer is",multiple-choice,"inadmissible, because the evidence is barred by the parol evidence rule.","inadmissible, because the express terms of the agreement control when those terms are inconsistent with the course of performance.","admissible, because the evidence supports an agreement that is not within the relevant statute of frauds.","admissible, because course-of-performance evidence, when available, is considered the best indication of what the parties intended the writing to mean.",,,4,"D is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of extrinsic evidence of certain statements made prior to the adoption of a final written agreement. Evidence of course-of-performance, however, is admissible to interpret a writing so long as the evidence can reasonably be construed in a way that is consistent with the writing. Because the written agreement between the manufacturer and the retailer is silent on the issue of returning undefective radios for credit, evidence of the parties' performance during the first three years of the agreement on this issue is admissible to interpret the writing.

A is incorrect. The parol evidence rule does not bar the admission of course-of-performance evidence. B is incorrect. The express terms of the contract are silent on the issue of returning undefective radios. C is incorrect. The statute of frauds is not relevant to the issue of contract interpretation.","Contract Content and Meaning"

Which of the following statements best describes the businesswoman's rights after being fired?",multiple-choice,"She can recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years if she remains ready to work.","She can recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years if no comparable job is reasonably available and she does not take another job.","She can rescind the contract of sale and get back her business upon tender to the company of $25 million.","She can get specific performance of her right to serve as a vice president of the company for two years.",,,2,"A is incorrect. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. However, a wrongfully discharged employee is expected to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to seek comparable employment. In this case, to avoid a reduction in her damages, the businesswoman is required to do more than remain ready to work. Her recovery will be reduced by the compensation she earned or could have earned if she had made reasonable efforts to secure comparable employment. 

B is correct. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. A wrongfully discharged employee is expected to mitigate damages by making reasonable efforts to seek comparable employment. However, if no comparable employment is reasonably available and the businesswoman does not take another job, the businesswoman is entitled to recover the promised salary for the remainder of the two years. 

C is incorrect. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment was probably not a material breach of contract. It represented only a small part of a large contract and can easily be remedied by an award of damages. But even if the breach was material, a court would likely employ the concept of divisibility to preclude the businesswoman from rescinding the contract of sale. As stated in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 240, a contract is divisible where ""the performances to be exchanged under an exchange of promises can be apportioned into corresponding pairs of part performances so that the parts of each pair are properly regarded as agreed equivalents."" Here, the agreed equivalents would be the sale of the business and the corresponding $25 million purchase price, and the businesswoman's promise to work for the company and the corresponding yearly salary of $150,000. Applying this concept, the businesswoman would be able to recover damages for the company's breach of its promise to employ her, but she would not be permitted to rescind the contract of sale. 

D is incorrect. The company's unjustified termination of the businesswoman's employment constituted a breach of contract entitling the businesswoman to recover monetary damages. The general rule is that employers cannot obtain specific performance requiring an employee who has breached a personal services contract to work for the employer. It is also true generally that courts refuse to grant specific performance of an employment contract against a breaching employer. Consequently, the businesswoman's recovery will consist of the unpaid salary under the contract, reduced by the compensation she earned or could have earned if she had made reasonable efforts to secure comparable employment.",Remedies
"In a telephone conversation, a jewelry maker offered to buy 100 ounces of gold from a precious metals company if delivery could be made within 10 days. The jewelry maker did not specify a price, but the market price for 100 ounces of gold at the time of the conversation was approximately $65,000. Without otherwise responding, the company delivered the gold six days later. 

In the meantime, the project for which the jewelry maker planned to use the gold was canceled. The jewelry maker therefore refused to accept delivery of the gold or to pay the $65,000 demanded by the company.

"A flour wholesaler contracted to deliver to a producer of fine baked goods her flour requirements for a one-year period. Before delivery of the first scheduled installment, the flour wholesaler sold its business and ""assigned"" all of its sale contracts to a miller, another reputable and long-time flour wholesaler. The original flour wholesaler informed the baked goods producer of this transaction.

Assume that the baked goods producer accepted the miller's delivery of the first installment as set out in the original contract between the flour wholesaler and the baked goods producer. However, the baked goods producer paid the contract price for that installment to the flour wholesaler and refused to pay anything to the miller.

In an action by the miller against the baked goods producer for the contractual amount of the first installment, who will most likely prevail?",multiple-choice,"The baked goods producer, because she had not expressly agreed to accept the miller as her flour supplier.","The baked goods producer, because the payment of the contractual installment to the flour wholesaler discharged her obligation.","The miller, because he is a third-party beneficiary with vested rights.","The miller, because the flour wholesaler validly assigned his rights and delegated his duties under the original contract to the miller.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The flour wholesaler validly assigned his rights and delegated his duties from the original contract to the miller. This contract concerns a sale of goods, and is therefore governed by the UCC. Under the UCC, a party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract. Because the miller is comparable to the flour wholesaler in terms of reputation and experience, the baked goods producer should not have a particular interest in having the flour wholesaler perform the contract.

A is incorrect. Performance of the contract by the delegatee ordinarily does not require the assent of the other party to the contract. When the flour wholesaler sold its business and assigned its contracts of sale to the miller, the baked goods producer's agreement to the delegation was not necessary.

B is incorrect because, once the other party to the contract (the baked goods producer) has received notice of an assignment of rights, she can discharge her obligation only upon payment to the assignee (the miller). Payment to the assignor will not discharge the obligation.

C is incorrect. The miller is not a third-party beneficiary. A third-party beneficiary situation arises when two parties enter into a contract that provides that one of the parties will render performance to benefit a third party outside of the contract. The parties to the contract must have had the intent to benefit a third party. In this case, when the contract was formed, there was no intent to benefit the miller or any other third party.","Third-Party Rights"
"A bakery offered a chef a permanent full-time job as a pastry chef at a salary of $3,000 per month. The chef agreed to take the position and to begin work in two weeks. In her employment application, the chef had indicated that she was seeking a permanent job. One week after the chef was hired by the bakery, a hotel offered the chef a position as a restaurant manager at a salary of $3,500 a month. The chef accepted and promptly notified the bakery that she would not report for work at the bakery.

Is the bakery likely to prevail in a lawsuit against the chef for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"No, because a contract for permanent employment would be interpreted to mean the chef could leave at any time.","No, because the position the chef took with the hotel was not substantially comparable to the one she had agreed to take with the bakery.","Yes, because the chef's acceptance of a permanent position meant that she agreed to leave the bakery only after a reasonable time.","Yes, because the chef's failure to give the bakery a chance to match the salary offered by the hotel breached the implied right of first refusal.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The issue here is the interpretation of the term ""permanent employment"" in the bakery-chef contract. It is well established that ""permanent employment"" means ""employment-at-will"" in this context. In an employment-at-will relationship, either party can terminate the agreement at any time, without the termination being considered a breach (unless the termination were to violate an important public policy — which is not the case here). Accordingly, the chef is not liable for breach of contract.

Answer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the bakery will not prevail in a breach of contract action against the chef, but it misstates the reason why this is so. The question whether the job the baker took with the hotel was comparable to the one she left at the bakery is not relevant here. The comparability issue DOES arise in cases in which an employee who has been terminated is offered another job; in such cases the employee's claim for breach would be reduced by wages which could have been earned at jobs which are not different and inferior. That is not the case in this problem.

Answer C is incorrect because it is grounded in an incorrect interpretation of the meaning of the word ""permanent"" in the context of employment agreements, as explained above.

Answer D is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it presumes the existence of an ""implied right of first refusal."" While some contracts do create rights of first refusal, such rights must be created by express agreement, and not by implication. In the context of employment agreements, it is well established that ""permanent employment"" means ""employment-at-will."" In an employment-at-will relationship, either party can terminate the agreement at any time, without the termination being considered a breach (unless the termination were to violate an important public policy — which is not the case here). Accordingly, the chef is not liable for breach of contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"A corporation, through its president, requested from a financing company a short-term loan of $100,000. On April 1, the corporation's president and the financing company's loan officer agreed orally that the financing company would make the loan on the following terms: (1) The loan would be repaid in full on or before the following July 1 and would carry interest at an annual rate of 15 percent (a lawful rate under the applicable usury law); and (2) the corporation's president would personally guarantee repayment. The loan was approved and made on April 5. The only document evidencing the loan was a memorandum, written and supplied by the financing company and signed by the president for the corporation, that read in its entirety:
""April 5

In consideration of a loan advanced on this date, the corporation hereby promises to pay the financing company, $100,000 on September 1.

The corporation

By /s/ the president""
The corporation did not repay the loan on or before July 1, although it had sufficient funds to do so. On July 10, the financing company sued the corporation as principal debtor and the corporation's president individually as guarantor for $100,000, plus 15 percent interest from April 5.

At the trial, can the financing company prove the corporation's oral commitment to repay the loan on or before July 1?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the oral agreement was supported by an independent consideration.","Yes, because the evidence of the parties' negotiations is relevant to their contractual intent concerning maturity of the debt.","No, because such evidence is barred by the preexisting duty rule.","No, because such evidence contradicts the writing and is barred by the parol evidence rule.",,,4,"D is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). The oral commitment that the financing company seeks to introduce (that the loan would be repaid ""on or before July 1"") contradicts the final writing executed between the parties (stating that the corporation promises to repay the loan ""on September 1""). Therefore, it is barred by the parol evidence rule.

A is incorrect. The collateral agreement exception to the parol evidence rule would not apply where the extrinsic evidence is in direct conflict with the writing. B is incorrect. Evidence of the parties' negotiations is precisely the type of evidence that the parol evidence rule excludes. C is incorrect. The promise is inadmissible under the parol evidence rule regardless of whether it was supported by consideration.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A debtor owed a lender $1,500. The statute of limitations barred recovery on the claim. The debtor wrote to the lender, stating, ""I promise to pay you $500 if you will extinguish the debt."" The lender agreed.

Is the debtor's promise to pay the lender $500 enforceable?",multiple-choice,"No, because the debtor made no promise not to plead the statute of limitations as a defense.","No, because there was no consideration for the debtor's promise.","Yes, because the debtor's promise provided a benefit to the lender.","Yes, because the debtor's promise to pay part of the barred antecedent debt is enforceable.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A promise to pay a debt after the running of the statute of limitations, like the promise in this case, is enforceable without consideration. The enforcement of such a promise is a long-established exception to the requirement that there be consideration to support the enforcement of promises. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answer B is incorrect.

Answer A is incorrect. This is not the best answer because it is not really responsive to the question. The debtor had a statute-of-limitations defense which was partially destroyed by the promise to pay $500. The debtor DID promise to pay $500, which implies that the payment would be made and that, at least as to that $500, there would be no reliance on the statute of limitations.

Answer C is incorrect. This answer is incorrect because it is not really responsive to the question. Promises are not enforceable merely because their performance would benefit the promisee. This is obvious if one remembers that a promise to make a gift is not enforceable even though the promise, if performed, would benefit the donee.","Formation of Contracts"
"Two salesmen, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen--one for a pharmaceutical company and the other for a widget manufacturer. The pharmaceutical salesman wrote the widget salesman by United States mail on Friday, October 8:

I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or before noon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand.

Sincerely,

[signed] the pharmaceutical salesman

The widget salesman replied by mail the following day:

I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified.

Sincerely,

[signed] the widget salesman

This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by the pharmaceutical salesman until November 10. The pharmaceutical salesman had bought another Sujocki bike from a different friend for $1,050 a few hours before.

The friend saw the widget salesman at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: ""I sold my Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman yesterday for $1,050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?"" The widget salesman replied: ""I'll let you know in a few days.""

On November 12, the widget salesman took his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman's residence; he arrived at 11:15 a.m. The pharmaceutical salesman was asleep and did not answer the ringing doorbell until 12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had already bought someone else's bike.

In a lawsuit by the widget salesman against the pharmaceutical salesman for breach of contract, what would the court probably decide regarding the widget salesman's letter of October 9?",multiple-choice,"The letter bound both parties to a unilateral contract as soon as the widget salesman mailed it.","Mailing of the letter by the widget salesman did not, of itself, prevent a subsequent, effective revocation by the pharmaceutical salesman of his offer.","The letter bound both parties to a bilateral contract, but only when received by the pharmaceutical salesman on November 10.","Regardless of whether the pharmaceutical salesman's offer had proposed a unilateral or a bilateral contract, the letter was an effective acceptance upon receipt, if not upon dispatch.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The widget salesman's letter was not an appropriate method of acceptance because the pharmaceutical salesman's letter offer requested performance; thus, the mail box rule would not apply to make the acceptance effective upon dispatch, and the pharmaceutical salesman's offer remained freely revocable. A is incorrect because the letter could not be reasonably construed as the beginning of performance. C is incorrect because the offer called for a unilateral acceptance. D is also incorrect because the offer did not invite the widget salesman to choose between acceptance by promise and acceptance by performance.","Formation of Contracts"
"A famous chef entered into a written agreement with his neighbor, a well-known interior decorator respected for his unique designs, in which the decorator agreed, for a fixed fee, to design the interior of the chef's new restaurant, and, upon the chef's approval of the design plan, to decorate and furnish the restaurant accordingly. The agreement was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. Before beginning the work, the decorator sold his decorating business to his friend under an agreement in which the decorator assigned to the friend, and the friend agreed to complete, the chef-decorator contract. The friend, also an experienced decorator of excellent repute, advised the chef of the assignment, and supplied him with information confirming both the friend's financial responsibility and past commercial success. 

If the chef allows the friend to perform and approves his design plan, but the friend fails without legal excuse to complete the decorating as agreed, against whom does the chef have an enforceable claim for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"The decorator only, because the decorator's agreement with the friend did not discharge his duty to the chef, and the friend made no express promise to the chef.","Only the friend, because the decorator's duty to the chef was discharged when the decorator obtained a skilled decorator (the friend) to perform the chef-decorator contract.","Only the friend, because the chef was an intended beneficiary of the decorator-friend agreement, and the decorator's duty to the chef was discharged when the chef permitted the friend to do the work and approved the friend's designs.","Either the decorator, because his agreement with the friend did not discharge his duty to the chef, or the friend, because the chef was an intended beneficiary of the decorator-friend agreement.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Unless the other party to the contract (the obligee, or the chef) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor (the decorator). Therefore, where a duty has been delegated (in this case, the duty to design the interior of the chef's new restaurant) and the delegatee (The friend) breaches the duty, the chef may enforce the contract either against the original obligor (the decorator), or against the delegatee (The friend). The chef may enforce The friend's promise because he is the intended beneficiary of the decorator-The friend contract (under which The friend undertook to design the interior of the chef's new restaurant).

A is incorrect because the chef is an intended beneficiary of the decorator-The friend agreement (in other words, allowing the chef standing to enforce the contract would be appropriate to effectuate the parties' understanding, since The friend must have understood that the decorator's intent was to confer a benefit on the chef). B and C are incorrect because delegation will not discharge the obligor's original duty (unless the parties execute a novation).","Third-Party Rights"
"A chef purchased the front portion of the land needed for a restaurant he desired to build and operate, but the back portion was the subject of a will dispute between a sister and brother. The sister's attorney advised that her claim was doubtful. The chef, knowing only that the unresolved dispute existed, agreed in a signed writing to pay the sister $6,000, payable $1,000 annually, in exchange for a quitclaim deed (a deed containing no warranties) from the sister, who promptly executed such a deed to the chef and received the chef's first annual payment. Shortly thereafter, the probate court handed down a decision in the brother's favor, ruling that the sister had no interest in the land. This decision has become final. The chef subsequently defaulted when his second annual installment came due.

In an action against the chef for breach of contract, the sister will probably",multiple-choice,"lose, because she was aware at the time of the agreement with the chef that her claim to the property quitclaimed was doubtful.","lose, because she suffered no legal detriment in executing the quitclaim deed.","win, because the chef bargained for, and received in exchange, a quitclaim deed from the sister.","win, because the chef, by paying the first $1,000 installment, is estopped to deny that his agreement with the sister is an enforceable contract.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by consideration. Consideration is a return promise or performance which is bargained-for, i.e., sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise and given by the promisee in exchange for the promise. Courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of consideration as long as the consideration was bargained-for; it is often said that ""even a peppercorn will suffice"" for consideration. In exchange for the chef's promise to pay the sister $6,000, the sister agreed to convey (and promptly conveyed) to the chef a quitclaim deed for a piece of property. Although the sister was aware that her claim to the property was doubtful, and although the deed contained no warranty of title, her promise to convey the quitclaim deed was sufficient consideration to support the chef's promise.

Choice A is incorrect because what matters for finding consideration is the existence of an exchange, even if the values exchanged are unequal (the answer would be different if, instead of giving the quitclaim deed, the sister had promised to forbear from bringing a claim that she knew was doubtful). B is incorrect because the legal test for consideration focuses on the existence of a bargain rather than legal detriment. D is incorrect because the chef paid the first $1,000 before he became aware of the true value of the quitclaim deed.","Formation of Contracts"
"The mother of a son and a daughter was dying. The daughter visited her mother in a hospice facility and said, ""You know that I have always been the good child, and my brother has always been the bad child. Even so, you have left your property in the will to us fifty-fifty. But it would be really nice if you would sell me the family home for $100,000."" 

""I don't know,"" said the mother. ""It is worth a lot more than that-at least $250,000."" 

""That is true,"" said the daughter. ""But I have always been good and visited you, and my brother has never visited you, so that ought to be worth something. And besides, if you won't sell me the house for that price, maybe I won' t visit you anymore, either."" 

""Oh, I wouldn't want that,"" said the mother, and she signed a contract selling the house to her daughter for $100,000. 

Shortly thereafter, the mother died. When her son found out that the house had been sold and was not part of his mother's estate, he sued to have the contract avoided on behalf of the mother. 

On what ground would the contract most likely be avoided?",multiple-choice,Duress.,"Inadequate consideration.",Mistake.,"Undue influence.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A contract is voidable if the elements of undue influence--undue susceptibility to pressure and excessive pressure--are established. The undue susceptibility element can be established either by the circumstances (e.g., the mother's illness) or the existence of a confidential relationship (such as a parent-child relationship). The following facts support a finding of excessive pressure: the daughter's statement that she might not visit her mother, the daughter pressuring her mother to sell the property while her mother was in a hospice facility, the mother assenting without obtaining independent advice, and the mother's susceptibility to pressure.

Answer A is incorrect. A contract can be avoided on the basis of duress. However, the facts fail to establish the elements of duress. Duress requires an improper threat. The daughter's statement that she might not visit her mother does not constitute an improper threat sufficient to support avoidance based on duress.

Answer B is incorrect. If a bargained-for exchange is present, there is no additional requirement, such as an equivalency of exchange, to satisfy the consideration requirement of an enforceable contract. Moreover, the imbalance in the exchange between the mother and her daughter does not constitute the gross inadequacy of exchange that so shocks the conscience as to warrant invalidating the agreement.

Answer C is incorrect. The mistake doctrine supports avoidance of a contract. An essential element of the mistake doctrine is a mistake, which is defined as a ""belief that is not in accord with the facts."" The facts in this case fail to establish a legally cognizable mistake.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A seller and a buyer entered into a contract obligating the seller to convey title to a parcel of land to the buyer for $100,000.

The buyer was unable to do so, but did obtain a loan at an interest rate of 10.5% and timely tendered the purchase price. Because the value of the land had increased since the time of contracting, the seller refused to perform. The buyer sued the seller.

Will the buyer prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because an express condition will be excused only to avoid forfeiture.","No, because the contract called for a loan at an interest rate not to exceed 10% and it could not be modified without the consent of the seller.","Yes, because the buyer detrimentally changed position in reliance on the seller's promise to convey.","Yes, because the buyer's obtaining a loan at an interest rate no higher than 10% was not a condition to the seller's duty to perform.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Courts look beyond the words of a condition, and if it is clear that the intent of the condition was to benefit or protect one of the parties, the language of the condition will be interpreted as if that intent had been clearly expressed in the contract terms. In this case, it is clear that the condition was intended for the benefit of the buyer as a condition to the buyer’s duty. The buyer’s waiver of the condition required the seller to perform despite the nonoccurrence of the condition.

A is incorrect. This statement of the law is much too broad to be true. Courts look beyond the words of a condition, and if it is clear that the purpose of the condition was to benefit or protect one of the parties, the language of the condition will be interpreted as if that intention had been embodied in the contract terms. In this case it is clear that the language of the condition was intended for the benefit of the buyer, and so the seller's duty was not subject to the condition.

B is incorrect. The issue in this dispute does not concern modification of the contract. The parties did nothing which could be interpreted as an attempt to modify the agreement. The issue is whether the seller’s duty was conditional. Courts look beyond the words of a condition, and if it is clear that the intent of the condition was to benefit or protect one of the parties, the language of the condition will be interpreted as if that intent had been clearly expressed in the contract terms. In this case it is clear that the condition was intended for the benefit of the buyer as a condition to the buyer’s duty. The buyer’s waiver of the condition required the seller to perform despite the nonoccurrence of the condition.

C is incorrect. While it is true that the buyer changed position because of the seller’s promise, that fact is not relevant to the question of whether the seller’s duty to perform was subject to a condition.

"On March 31, a seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement in which the seller agreed to fabricate and sell to the buyer 10,000 specially designed brake linings for a new type of power brake manufactured by the buyer. The contract provided that the buyer would pay half of the purchase price on May 15 in order to give the seller funds to ""tool up"" for the work; that the seller would deliver 5,000 brake linings on May 31; that the buyer would pay the balance of the purchase price on June 15; and that the seller would deliver the balance of the brake linings on June 30.

On May 10, the seller notified the buyer that it was doubtful whether the seller could perform because of problems encountered in modifying its production machines to produce the brake linings. On May 15, however, the seller assured the buyer that the production difficulties had been overcome, and the buyer paid the seller the first 50 percent installment of the purchase price. The seller did not deliver the first 5,000 brake linings on May 31, or at any time thereafter; and on June 10, the seller notified that it would not perform the contract.

Which of the following is NOT a correct statement of the parties' legal status immediately after the seller's notice on June 10?",multiple-choice,"The buyer has a cause of action for total breach of contract because of the seller's repudiation, but that cause of action will be lost if the seller retracts its repudiation before the buyer changes its position or manifests to the seller that the buyer considers the repudiation final.","The buyer can bring suit to rescind the contract even if it elects to await the seller's performance for a commercially reasonable time.","The buyer can await performance by the seller for a commercially reasonable time, but if the buyer awaits performance beyond that period, it cannot recover any resulting damages that it reasonably could have avoided.","The buyer has a cause of action for breach of contract that it can successfully assert only after it has given the seller a commercially reasonable time to perform.",,,4,"D is correct. Under the UCC, when either party repudiates a contract for the sale of goods with respect to a performance whose loss will substantially affect the value of the contract, the non-repudiating party may await performance for a commercially reasonable time or immediately resort to remedies for breach of contract. The non-repudiating party, however, may not recover damages that he might have mitigated with reasonable effort. The repudiating party is still free to retract its repudiation unless the non-repudiating party has relied on it or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final. The seller's June 10 statement that it would not perform the contract, when read in light of its earlier communications and failure to make a delivery when due, amounts to a repudiation that gives the buyer the right to bring immediate action for breach. Therefore, D is the correct answer choice because the buyer does not need to give the seller a commercially reasonable time to perform. A, B, and C are incorrect. Each of these statements are accurate.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"

There was also a clause providing for per diem damages if the expert did not complete performance by a specified date and a clause providing that ""time is of the essence."" Another clause provided that any subsequent agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing and signed by both parties.

Assume that the builder orally agreed with the expert to accept the man's services and that the man performed on time but negligently installed the wrong air-conditioning equipment.

Will the builder succeed in an action against the expert for damages for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the builder did not agree to release the expert from liability under the expert-builder contract.","Yes, because the builder received no consideration for the substitution of the man for the expert.","No, because by accepting the substitution of the man for the expert, the builder effected a novation, and the expert was thereby discharged of his duties under the expert-builder contract.","No, because the liquidated-damage clause in the expert-builder contract provided only for damages caused by delay in performance.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Unless the other party to the contract (the obligee) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor. Although the builder orally agreed to accept the delegation of the expert's duties to the man, that agreement did not effect a novation, or a release of the expert's obligation under the contract.

B is incorrect because a delegation does not require consideration to be effective. C is incorrect because an acceptance of delegation is not the same as a novation. D is incorrect because a liquidated damages provision for delay does not preclude recovery of other types of damages resulting from a breach.","Third-Party Rights"
"The owner of a fleet of taxis contracted with a dealer in petroleum products for the purchase and sale of the taxi fleet owner's total requirements of gasoline and oil for one year. As part of that agreement, the petroleum dealer also agreed with the taxi fleet owner that for one year the petroleum dealer would place all his advertising with the taxi fleet owner's wife who owned her own small advertising agency. The wife at the time had just been offered another advertising contract with a soap company. When the wife was informed of the owner-dealer contract, she declined to accept the account from the soap company because she could not handle both the petroleum dealer and the soap company accounts during the same year.

The wife was an intended beneficiary under the owner-dealer contract. The taxi fleet owner performed his contract with the petroleum dealer for six months, and during that time the petroleum dealer placed his advertising with the wife. At the end of the six months, the taxi fleet owner and the wife were divorced, and the taxi fleet owner then told the petroleum dealer that he had no further obligation to place his advertising with the wife. The petroleum dealer thereupon notified the wife that he would no longer place his advertising with her.

In an action against the petroleum dealer for breach of contract, the wife will probably:",multiple-choice,"succeed, because, on the facts of this case, the petroleum dealer and the taxi fleet owner could not, without the wife's consent, modify their contract so as to discharge the petroleum dealer's duties to the wife.","succeed, because the taxi fleet owner acted in bad faith in releasing the petroleum dealer from his duty with respect to the wife.","not succeed, because, absent a provision in the contract to the contrary, the promisor and promisee of a third-party beneficiary contract retain by law the right to modify or terminate the contract.","not succeed, because the agency relationship, if any, between the taxi fleet owner and the wife terminated upon their divorce.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The rights of a third party beneficiary to a contract may not be modified or discharged after the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if she relies on the promise or manifests assent to the promise at the request of the promisor or promisee. Because the wife declined to accept an advertising account from the soap company after hearing of the owner-dealer contract, she relied on the petroleum dealer's promise. The fact that the contract was performed for six months also suggests implicit acceptance of the petroleum dealer's promise. Therefore, the taxi fleet owner and the petroleum dealer cannot modify or discharge the petroleum dealer's obligation without the wife's consent.

Answer B is incorrect because the wife's ability to succeed in her breach of contract action really hinges on whether her rights as intended beneficiary have vested, and not on the taxi fleet owner's bad faith. Answer C is incorrect because the promisor and promisee's right to modify or discharge the contract is terminated once the beneficiary's rights vest. Answer D is incorrect because any agency relationship the wife has with the taxi fleet owner is irrelevant to her rights as third-party beneficiary.","Third-Party Rights"
"An actor straight out of drama school and an agent entered into a one-year written contract that described the services the agent would provide. Because he was eager for work, the actor agreed, in the contract, to pay the agent 15% of his yearly earnings. At the end of the year, the actor was so pleased with his many roles that he gave the agent 20% of his earnings. After the first contract had expired, the actor and the agent decided to continue working together. They photocopied their old contract, changed the date, and signed it. At the end of the year, a dispute arose as to what percentage of earnings the actor owed. It is a trade practice in the acting profession for actors to pay their agents 10% of their yearly earnings, payable at the end of the year.

What percentage of the actor's earnings is a court most likely to award the agent?",multiple-choice,"20%, because course of dealing is given greater weight than trade usage.","15%, because it was an express term of the contract.","10%, because trade usage is the applicable default rule.","Nothing, because the contract is too indefinite.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The parties' new contract adopted the terms of their previous contract, which included the 15% fee. Evidence of express terms is given greater weight than evidence of trade usage. Therefore the express term, the 15% fee, is controlling because a court would give it greater weight than the evidence of trade usage, the 10% fee.

Answer A is incorrect. The generally applicable standard, which provides that evidence of course of dealing is given greater weight than evidence of trade usage, is inapplicable here because a ""course of dealing"" was never established and because the written contract was explicit. One instance of previous conduct is insufficient to establish a prior course of dealing.

Answer C is incorrect. Evidence of an express term is given greater weight than evidence of trade usage. The parties' new contract adopted the terms of their previous contract, which specifically included the 15% fee. Therefore the express term of 15% controls the amount of the fee to which the agent is entitled.

Answer D is incorrect. The contract contains the essential terms, including the duration, a description of the agent's services, and the method for calculating the agent's fee, 15% of the actor's earnings in this case.","Formation of Contracts"
"On March 2, a landowner and a builder orally agreed that the builder would erect a boathouse on the landowner's lot and dig a channel from the boathouse, across a neighbor's lot, to a lake. The neighbor had already orally agreed with the landowner to permit the digging of the channel across the neighbor's lot. The builder agreed to begin work on the boathouse on March 15, and to complete all the work before June 1. The total price of $10,000 was to be paid by the landowner in three installments: $2,500 on March 15; $2,500 when the boathouse was completed; $5,000 when the builder finished the digging of the channel.

Assume that the landowner paid the $2,500 on March 15 and that the builder completed the boathouse according to specifications, but that the landowner then refused to pay the second installment and repudiated the contract. Assume further that the absence of a writing is not raised as a defense. Which of the following is correct?",multiple-choice,"The builder has a cause of action against the landowner and his damages will be $2,500.","The builder can refuse to dig the channel and not be liable for breach of contract.","The builder can refuse to dig the channel, not be liable for breach of contract, and have a cause of action against the landowner for which his damages will be $2,500.","The builder can refuse to dig the channel but he will liable for breach of contract.",,,2,"B is correct. Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that obligation. Once a repudiation occurs, the non-repudiating party is discharged from any further performance under the contract and may immediately recover damages for total breach. When a contractor is injured due to an owner's total breach of a construction contract, the contractor generally can recover his expected profit on the entire contract along with any labor and material expenses incurred up until the time that he learned of the owner's breach, minus any progress payments made by the owner.

Although the landowner repudiated the agreement just after the second $2,500 progress payment became due, the builder would be entitled to obtain as damages not only the progress payment but also his expected profit on the entire contract. Because these damages would exceed $2,500, answers A and C are incorrect. The builder is also entitled to withhold his remaining performance under the contract and will not be considered in breach. Therefore, answer D is incorrect, making B the correct answer.",Remedies
"A father and his adult daughter encountered an old family friend on the street. The daughter said to the family friend, ""How about lending me $1,000 to buy a used car? I'll pay you back with interest one year from today."" The father added, ""And if she doesn't pay it back as promised, I will."" The family friend thereupon wrote out and handed to the daughter his personal check, payable to her, for $1,000, and the daughter subsequently used the funds to buy a used car. When the debt became due, both the daughter and the father refused to repay it, or any part of it.

In an action by the family friend against the father to recover $1,000 plus interest, which of the following statements would summarize the father's best defense?",multiple-choice,"He received no consideration for his conditional promise to the family friend.","His conditional promise to the family friend was not to be performed in less than a year from the time it was made.","His conditional promise to the family friend was not made for the primary purpose of benefiting himself (the father).","The loan by the family friend was made without any agreement concerning the applicable interest rate.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Generally, a promise to guarantee a debt to a third person falls under the Statute of Frauds and therefore must be in writing and signed by the party to be charged in order to be enforceable. However, the promise will not fall under the statute where the principal purpose of making the guarantee was to benefit the promisor himself. Therefore, if the father's promise was made for the primary purpose of benefiting his daughter, then his promise to guarantee his daughter's debt falls within the statute of frauds. Because the promise was made verbally, there is no signed writing to satisfy the requirements of the statute.

Answer A is incorrect because consideration was given to the daughter. Answer B is incorrect because only a promise that cannot be performed within a year of its making falls within the statute. Answer D is incorrect because the daughter's promise is sufficiently definite to be enforced notwithstanding the failure to specify an interest rate - the interest rate term may be implied.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"On June 1, a manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retailer: ""Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July 1.""

On June 1, the manufacturer shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at the retailer's place of business on June 3. The retailer immediately telegraphed the manufacturer: ""Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties."" The retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer replied by telegram: ""Will deliver proper ties before July 1."" The retailer received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it.

On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34, but the retailer refused to accept them.

Did the retailer properly reject the ties delivered on June 3?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the ties were nonconforming goods.","Yes, because the manufacturer did not notify the retailer that the ties were shipped as an accommodation to the retailer.","No, because the manufacturer could accept the retailer's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or nonconforming goods.","No, because the retailer waived his right to reject the ties by not returning them promptly to the manufacturer.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The retailer satisfied its duty to promptly notify the manufacturer that the goods were rejected as nonconforming.

B and C are incorrect because pursuant to UCC 2-206, a seller accepts whether it ships conforming or nonconforming goods. If the seller's shipment, however, is accompanied by notice that the goods are nonconforming and are offered as an accommodation, the seller has not accepted but has made a counter offer, which the retailer could have accepted or rejected. The manufacturer's shipment without notice constituted an attempted acceptance and simultaneously a breach of contract. The retailer was entitled to perfect tender of the goods under UCC 2-601 and was free to reject goods that failed ""in any respect to conform to the contract.""

D is incorrect because the retailer did not waive his rights upon rejection and retention of the goods. He was under a duty to notify the seller and to hold the goods ""with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them.""

"An expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, contracted in a signed writing to lift and emplace certain air-conditioning equipment atop a builder's building. An exculpatory clause in the contract provided that the expert would not be liable for any physical damage to the builder's building occurring during installation of the air-conditioning equipment. There was also a clause providing for per diem damages if the expert did not complete performance by a specified date and a clause providing that ""time is of the essence."" Another clause provided that any subsequent agreement for extra work under the contract must be in writing and signed by both parties.

With ample time remaining under the contract for commencement and completion of his performance, the expert notified the builder that he was selling his business to a man who was equally expert in lifting and emplacing equipment atop tall buildings, and that the man had agreed to ""take over the expert-builder contract.""

If the builder refuses to accept the man's services, which of the following clauses in the expert-builder contract will best support the builder's contention that the expert's duties under the contract were not delegable without the builder's consent?",multiple-choice,"The exculpatory clause.","The liquidated-damage clause.","The ""time is of the essence"" clause.","The extra-work clause.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. An obligor may delegate its duty under a contract to another unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Therefore, the expert may delegate its duty under its contract with the builder unless the builder has a substantial interest in having the expert (and not the man) perform the contract.

B, C and D are incorrect because ordinarily, the builder should be indifferent to whether the expert or the man timely performs the lifting and emplacing work provided for under contract, because in the event of breach, the expert (the original obligor), remains liable. However, the builder will have a substantial interest in having the expert perform the contract due to the exculpatory clause in the agreement, which may pose minimal or substantial risk to the builder depending on the party that is undertaking the work.","Third-Party Rights"
"A manager, aged 60, who had no plans for early retirement, had worked for an insurance company for 20 years as a managerial employee-at-will when he had a conversation with the company's president about the manager's post-retirement goal of extensive travel around the United States. A month later, the president handed the manager a written, signed resolution of the company's Board of Directors stating that when and if the manager should decide to retire, at his option, the company, in recognition of his past service, would pay him a $2,000-per-month lifetime pension. (The company had no regularized retirement plan for at-will employees.) Shortly thereafter, the manager retired and immediately bought a $30,000 recreational vehicle for his planned travels. After receiving the promised $2,000 monthly pension from the insurance company for six months, the manager, now unemployable elsewhere, received a letter from the insurance company, advising him that the pension would cease immediately because of recessionary budget constraints affecting in varying degrees all managerial salaries and retirement pensions.

In a suit against the insurance company for breach of contract, the manager will probably",multiple-choice,"win, because he retired from the company as bargained-for consideration for the Board's promise to him of a lifetime pension.","win, because he timed his decision to retire and to buy the recreational vehicle in reasonable reliance on the Board's promise to him of a lifetime pension.","lose, because the Board's promise to him of a lifetime pension was an unenforceable gift promise.","lose, because he had been an employee-at-will throughout his active service with the company.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the theory of detrimental reliance, a gratuitous promise may be enforceable notwithstanding lack of consideration if the party making the promise has reason to expect the promise will induce reliance on the part of the promisee, where there has been reliance in fact, and where injustice may be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The manager's conversation with the company's president gave the insurance company reason to expect that a promise of a lifetime pension would induce reliance on the part of the manager. The manager relied in fact by retiring and spending $30,000 on a trailer. Finally, justice requires enforcement because the manager is no longer eligible for employment.

A is incorrect because the company's promise to pay a pension was not conditioned upon the manager's retirement, and therefore it was not part of a bargained-for exchange. C is incorrect because gift promises may be enforceable on grounds of promissory estoppel. D is incorrect because the manager's status as an at-will employee does not affect his ability to enforce the pension promise on a detrimental reliance theory.","Formation of Contracts"
"On June 1, a general contractor and a subcontractor entered into a contract under which the subcontractor agreed to deliver all of the steel joists that the general contractor required in the construction of a hospital building. The contract provided that delivery of the steel joists would begin on September 1. 

Although the general contractor had no reason to doubt the subcontractor's ability to perform, the general contractor wanted to be sure that the subcontractor was on track for delivery in September. He therefore wrote a letter on July 1 to the subcontractor demanding that the subcontractor provide assurance of its ability to meet the September 1 deadline. The subcontractor refused to provide such assurance. 

The general contractor then immediately obtained the steel joists from another supplier. 

If the subcontractor sues the general contractor for breach of contract, is the subcontractor likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because the subcontractor anticipatorily repudiated the contract when it failed to provide adequate assurance.","No, because the contract failed to specify a definite quantity.","Yes, because a demand for assurance constitutes a breach of contract when the contract does not expressly authorize a party to demand assurance.","Yes, because the subcontractor's failure to provide assurance was not a repudiation since there were no reasonable grounds for the general contractor's insecurity.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The adequate assurance doctrine requires that a party respond to a demand for adequate assurance only if the demand is reasonable and justified. A demand is justified if the party making the demand has reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the other party's potential performance. The facts in this case state that the general contractor had no reason to doubt the subcontractor's ability to perform. Therefore, the general contractor was unjustified in demanding adequate assurance, and the subcontractor properly refused to respond to the demand. See UCC § 2-609. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answer A is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. The parties entered into a requirements contract that under UCC § 2-306(1) will not fail for indefiniteness because the contract did not include a specific quantity term. The subcontractor will likely prevail because under the adequate assurance doctrine, a party need respond to a demand for adequate assurance only if the demand is reasonable and justified, and the general contractor's demand for assurance was unjustified.

Answer C is incorrect. The adequate assurance doctrine is a UCC implied term that arises by operation of law. Therefore, the doctrine's applicability is not dependent upon the express authority of the party seeking assurance. However, in this case, the general contractor's demand for assurance was unjustified because he had no reasonable grounds for insecurity. Therefore, the subcontractor will likely prevail.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On June 1, a seller agreed to sell an antique car to a buyer for $20,000, in a writing signed by both the seller and the buyer. At the time, the car was on display in a museum in a different city and was to be delivered to the buyer on August 1. On July 15, before the risk of loss had passed to the buyer, the car was destroyed by fire without fault of either party. Subsequent to the contract but before the fire, the car had increased in value to $30,000. The seller sued the buyer for the contract price of $20,000, and the buyer counterclaimed for $30,000. 

What is the likely outcome of this suit?",multiple-choice,"Both claims fail.","Only the seller's claim will succeed.","Only the buyer's claim prevails.","Both claims will succeed, and the buyer will recover $10,000.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. UCC § 2-613 provides that where goods, identified at the time the contract was made, are totally destroyed before the risk of their loss has passed to the buyer and without the fault of either party, the contract is avoided and each party is relieved of its respective obligation to perform. Under UCC § 2-501, the goods were identified at the time of contract formation since the parties agreed to the delivery of a specific automobile. In addition, the facts state that the car was destroyed without the fault of either party and before the risk of loss had passed. Therefore the contract is avoided. The avoidance of the contract excused both parties' performance obligation. Since each party's performance is discharged, neither party can assert a valid claim against the other.

Under the UCC, a modification to a contract for the sale of goods needs no additional consideration to be binding if the modification was made in good faith. Although the modification increasing the purchase price under the tool maker-manufacturer contract was unilateral, and therefore not supported by consideration, the modification was made in light of unexpected increased production costs, which suggests that it was proposed in good faith rather than to coerce the manufacturer into paying a higher price. A is incorrect. The UCC rule dispensing with consideration for good faith modifications. B and D are incorrect.

B is incorrect. The distributor's nonconforming shipment constituted both an acceptance of the grocer's offer to purchase and a breach of the parties' contract.

"Before putting her home up for sale, a homeowner painted the living room ceiling to conceal major water damage caused by a leaking roof that had not yet been repaired. On the first day the home was offered for sale, the homeowner gave a buyer a personal tour. The homeowner made no statements at all regarding the water damage or the roof. Without discovering the water damage or the leaking roof and without consulting a lawyer, the buyer immediately agreed in writing to buy the home for $200,000.

Before the closing date, the buyer discovered the water damage and the leaking roof. The cost of repair was estimated at $22,000. The buyer has refused to go through with the purchase.

If the homeowner sues the buyer for breach of contract, is the homeowner likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because no contract was formed since the buyer did not have a real opportunity to understand the essential terms of the contract.","No, because the homeowner concealed evidence of the water damage and of the leaking roof.","Yes, because the homeowner made no affirmative statements of fact about the water damage or the leaking roof.","Yes, because the buyer acted unreasonably by failing to employ an inspector to conduct an independent inspection of the home.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. A misrepresentation of fact that induces assent provides a basis for avoidance of a contract. A misrepresentation is defined as a statement that is not in accord with the facts. Affirmative conduct that is ""intended or known likely to prevent another from learning a fact is equivalent to an assertion that the fact does not exist"" and constitutes a misrepresentation. The homeowner's painting over the water damage constituted affirmative conduct intended to prevent the buyer from learning of the water damage and the leaking roof. Therefore, the buyer's assent was induced by a misrepresentation, and the buyer can avoid the contract.

Answer A is incorrect. The facts fail to support the conclusion that the buyer did not understand the essential terms of the contract. Moreover, an assenting party's lack of an opportunity to understand the essential terms of a contract will not necessarily invalidate the contract. In addition, a party's failure to use care in reading a writing will not necessarily preclude that party from avoiding a contract induced by fraud.

Answer C is incorrect. An affirmative statement is not required to avoid a contract on the basis of misrepresentation. As explained above, a misrepresentation occurred when the homeowner painted over the water damage, preventing the buyer from learning of the water damage and the leaking roof. Therefore, the buyer's assent was induced by a misrepresentation, and the buyer can avoid the contract.

Answer D is incorrect. A misrepresentation of fact that induces assent provides a basis for avoidance of a contract. As explained above, a misrepresentation occurred when the homeowner painted over the water damage, preventing the buyer from learning of the water damage and the leaking roof. Therefore, the buyer's assent was induced by a misrepresentation, and the buyer can avoid the contract.

"The plaintiff, a baseball star, contracted with the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, Inc., to perform for $5,000 at a children's concert as narrator of ""Peter and the Wolf."" Shortly before the concert, the baseball star became embroiled in a highly publicized controversy over whether he had cursed and assaulted a baseball fan. The orchestra canceled the contract out of concern that attendance might be adversely affected by the baseball star's appearance.

The baseball star sued the orchestra for breach of contract. His business agent testified without contradiction that the cancellation had resulted in the baseball star's not getting other contracts for performances and endorsements.

The trial court instructed the jury, in part, as follows: ""If you find for the plaintiff, you may award damages for losses which at the time of contracting could reasonably have been foreseen by the defendant as a probable result of its breach. However, the law does not permit recovery for the loss of prospective profits of a new business caused by breach of contract.""

Because the parties' agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank. 

B is incorrect. The bank was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the buyer and the seller, and the fact of discharge is irrelevant. The seller and the buyer entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank. 

C is correct. The buyer and the seller entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank. 

D is incorrect. It is true that a promise by a debtor to pay a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy requires no consideration to be enforceable. In this case, however, the discharge of the seller's debt is irrelevant. Here, the seller and the buyer entered into a bargained-for exchange for the sale and purchase of goods. Because their agreement provided that the buyer would pay to the bank the $5,000 that the buyer had promised to pay for the goods, the bank was an intended beneficiary of the enforceable agreement between the seller and the buyer, and the buyer is obligated to pay the bank.","Third-Party Rights"
"A fixtures company, in a signed writing, contracted with an apartment complex for the sale to the apartment complex of 50 identical sets of specified bathroom fixtures, 25 sets to be delivered on March 1, and the remaining 25 sets on April 1. The agreement did not specify the place of delivery, or the time or place of payment.

On March 1, the fixtures company tendered 24 sets to the apartment complex and explained, ""One of the 25 sets was damaged in transit from the manufacturer to us, but we will deliver a replacement within 5 days.""

Which of the following statements is correct?",multiple-choice,"The apartment complex is entitled to accept any number of the 24 sets, reject the rest, and cancel the contract both as to any rejected sets and the lot due on April 1.","The apartment complex is entitled to accept any number of the 24 sets and to reject the rest, but is not entitled to cancel the contract as to any rejected sets or the lot due on April 1.","The apartment complex must accept the 24 sets but is entitled to cancel the rest of the contract.","The apartment complex must accept the 24 sets and is not entitled to cancel the rest of the contract.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The UCC defines an installment contract as one that provides for the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted. When an installment under such a contract is non-conforming, the buyer must accept that installment if the seller gives adequate assurance of the defect's cure, unless the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of the installment and cannot be cured. Because the fixtures company-apartment complex contract is an installment contract and because the fixtures company gave assurances that the defective shipment would be cured within five days, the apartment complex must accept the rest of the shipment and would not be justified in canceling the rest of the contract.

A and B are incorrect because the UCC's ""perfect tender"" rule (which entitles a buyer to reject a tender of delivery that fails in any respect to conform to the contract) does not apply to installment contracts. C is incorrect because a buyer under an installment contract may treat the contract as breached only if the non-conformity of one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the contract as a whole.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"For several weeks, a wealthy, unemployed widow and a car dealer negotiated unsuccessfully over the purchase price of a new sports car. The car dealer knew the widow wanted her son to have the sports car as a wedding gift. On April 27, the car dealer sent the widow a signed, dated memo saying, ""If we can arrive at the same price within the next week, do we have a deal?"" The widow wrote ""Yes"" and her signature at the bottom of the memo and delivered it back to the car dealer on April 29.

On May 1, the widow wrote the car dealer a signed letter offering to buy ""one new sports car, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1."" By coincidence, the car dealer wrote the widow a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her ""one new sports car, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1."" These letters crossed in the mail and were respectively received and read by the widow and car dealer on May 2.

In an action brought by the widow, if the car dealer denies that the parties had a binding contract on May 3, which of the following most persuasively supports the widow's position?",multiple-choice,"A sale-of-goods contract may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, even though the moment of its making is undetermined.","A sale-of goods contract does not require that an acceptance be a mirror image of the offer.","With respect both to the making of an agreement and the requirement of consideration, identical cross-offers are functionally the same as an offer followed by a responsive acceptance.","Since the car dealer was a merchant in the transaction and the widow was not, the car dealer is estopped to deny that the parties' correspondence created a binding contract.",,,1,"A is correct. Under the UCC, appropriate conduct between the parties may be sufficient to show agreement to a contract for the sale of goods, even if an exchange of correspondence between the parties makes the exact moment of contract formation indeterminate. The car dealer and the widow agreed to enter into a contract for the sale of one new sports car, if they could reach agreement on a price within a week. Five days later, each party received a letter from the other proposing the exact same terms. Although it is unclear which communication was the offer and which was the acceptance, the exchange of correspondence proposing identical terms demonstrates that the condition was met and that the parties' conduct manifested agreement.

B is incorrect. The mirror image rule is not at issue because the parties' proposed terms were identical. Answer C is incorrect because it does not provide as accurate an explanation as choice A of the relevant rule of contract formation. Answer D is incorrect because the car dealer's status as a merchant is not relevant to the issue of estoppel.","Formation of Contracts"
"A wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson, established with a bank a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000.

The passbook was issued by the bank to the widow solely in her own name. That same day, disinterested witnesses being present, she handed the passbook to her stepson and said, ""As a token of my love and affection for you, I give you this $10,000 savings account."" Shortly thereafter, she changed her mind and wrote her stepson, ""I hereby revoke my gift to you of the $10,000 savings account with the bank. Please return my passbook immediately,"" and signed her name. The stepson received the letter but ignored it, and the widow died unexpectedly a few days later.

In litigation between the stepson and the widow's estate, which of the following is a correct statement of the parties' rights with respect to the money on deposit with the bank?",multiple-choice,"The estate prevails, because the widow's gift to the stepson was revocable and was terminated by her death.","The estate prevails, because the widow's gift to the stepson was revocable and was terminated by her express revocation.","The stepson prevails, because he took the widow's claim to the savings account by a gratuitous but effective and irrevocable assignment from the widow.","The stepson prevails, because his failure to reject the gift, even if the assignment was revocable, created an estoppel against the widow and her estate.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The widow orally manifested her intent to gratuitously assign her rights in the passbook savings account directly to her stepson. The stepson's acceptance is implied by his silence. A and B are incorrect because only promises to make future gifts are revocable. Completed gifts are not revocable, and this gift was effective immediately upon valid delivery of the passbook because a passbook is representative of the money in the account. D is incorrect because an estoppel is not created where there is a completed inter-vivos gift.","Third-Party Rights"
"On March 1, a seller orally agreed to sell his land, Homestead, to a buyer for $46,000 to be paid on March 31. The buyer orally agreed to pay $25,000 of the purchase price to a creditor of the seller in satisfaction of a debt which the seller said he had promised to pay the creditor.

On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed in $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the creditor.

In an action by the creditor against the buyer for $25,000, which of the following is correct?",multiple-choice,"The buyer could successfully raise the Statute of Frauds as a defense because the agreement was to answer for the debt of another.","The buyer could successfully raise the Statute of Frauds as a defense because the agreement was for the sale of an interest in land.","The buyer could successfully raise the Statute of Frauds as a defense because the agreement was to answer for the debt of another and the agreement was for the sale of an interest in land.","The buyer cannot raise a Statute of Frauds defense.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the Statute of Frauds, promises made to answer for the debt of another generally fall within the suretyship clause of the statute and therefore must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute. However, the suretyship clause does not apply where the surety promise was made to the principal (seller) and not to the obligee (the creditor). Contracts for the sale of an interest in land fall within the statute of frauds as well. The promise that the creditor is seeking to enforce, however, is not part of a contract for the sale of an interest in land but rather a promise to repay a $25,000 debt owed to the creditor by the seller. Therefore the buyer cannot raise a Statute of Frauds defense.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A professor said to the president of a secretarial service, ""Since you folks have done good typing work for me in the past, I promise to bring you the manuscript for my new book.""

""When?"" asked the president.

""First chapter next Monday,"" replied the professor.

""Wouldn't that be nice,"" said the president.

The following Monday the professor, foregoing the services of another secretarial service, brought chapter one to the secretarial service's office but the president refused to take it, saying that they were all booked up for three weeks.

Which of the following facts or inferences would be most helpful in an action by the professor against the secretarial service?",multiple-choice,"""When"" and ""Wouldn't that be nice"" implied a promise to type the manuscript.","The professor relied on the president's statement by bringing the manuscript to her service's office.","The secretarial service had done good work for the professor in the past.","The professor had foregone the services of another secretarial service.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. An implied-in-fact contract is an enforceable contract based on a tacit, rather than an express, promise. An implied-in-fact promise may be inferred from parties' conduct or from their statements when interpreted in the context of broader circumstances. Although the president did not expressly promise that she would type the professor's manuscript on the following Monday in exchange for payment, such an exchange may fairly be implied from the broader context of her responses to the professor's statements.

B and D are incorrect because in order for the professor to enforce the president's promise on a detrimental reliance theory, he would need to show that his change in position in reliance on the president's promise was such a detriment that enforcement of the promise would be necessary to avoid injustice. C is incorrect because the fact that the secretarial service did good work for the professor in the past does not in itself imply a promise to do such work in the future.","Formation of Contracts"
"On August 1, a geriatric company operating a ""lifetime care"" home for the elderly admitted an 84-year-old man for a trial period of two months. On September 25, the 84-year-old man and the geriatric company entered into a written lifetime care contract with an effective commencement date of October 1. The full contract price was $20,000, which, as required by the terms of the contract, the 84-year-old man prepaid to the geriatric company on September 25. The 84-year-old man died of a heart attack on October 2.

In a restitutionary action, can the administratrix of the 84-year-old man's estate, a surviving sister, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $20,000 paid to the geriatric company on September 25?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the geriatric company would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the 84-year-old man's expense.","Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.","No, because the 84-year-old man's life span and the duration of the geriatric company's commitment to him was a risk assumed by both parties.","No, because the geriatric company can show that between September 25 and the 84-year-old man's death it rejected, because of its commitment to the 84-year-old man, an application for lifetime care from another elderly person.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Restitution generally is not available to recover a benefit conferred pursuant to a valid and binding contract. When determining whether a contract may be unenforceable on grounds of unconscionability, the fairness of the exchange is determined as of the time that the contract was entered into. Although the price of $20,000 may seem unfair as of October 2, the risk that the 84-year-old man would die within a short period was one that he assumed when he entered into the contract on September 25.

A is incorrect because the benefit was conferred pursuant to a binding contract. B is incorrect because there was no frustration of purpose, the man was given care for the remainder of his life. D is incorrect because the company may enforce the contract at law and does not need to show detrimental reliance.","Formation of Contracts"
"A fixtures company, in a signed writing, contracted with an apartment complex for the sale to the apartment complex of 50 identical sets of specified bathroom fixtures, 25 sets to be delivered on March 1, and the remaining 25 sets on April 1. The agreement did not specify the place of delivery, or the time or place of payment.

Which of the following statements is correct?",multiple-choice,"The fixtures company must tender 25 sets to the apartment complex at the apartment complex's place of business on March 1, but does not have to turn them over to the apartment complex until the complex pays the contract price for the 25 sets.","The fixtures company has no duty to deliver 25 sets on March 1 at the fixtures company's place of business unless the apartment complex tenders the contract price for the 25 sets on that date.","The fixtures company must deliver 25 sets on March 1, and the apartment complex must pay the contract price for the 25 sets within a reasonable time after their delivery.","The fixtures company must deliver 25 sets on March 1, but the apartment complex's payment is due only upon the delivery of all 50 sets.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the UCC, unless the contract specifies otherwise, a buyer's obligation to pay is conditioned upon tender of the goods by seller. Tender is effected when the seller makes conforming goods available for the buyer's disposition and gives the buyer notice sufficient to enable the buyer to take delivery. Unless the contract specifies otherwise, the place of delivery is the seller's place of business, and payment is due at the time and place where the buyer is to receive the goods. Because the fixtures company-apartment complex contract is silent with respect to the place of delivery, tender by the fixtures company does not require them to deliver the goods to the apartment complex's place of business, but only to make the goods available at the fixtures company's place of business for the apartment complex to take delivery.

A is incorrect because tender does not require the fixtures company to deliver the goods to the apartment complex's place of business. C and D are incorrect because, since the contract is silent with respect to the time of payment, the apartment complex must make payment for the delivered goods on March 1, when the fixtures company has tendered delivery.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by the woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: ""I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident."" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that the son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The father replied: ""If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you.""

If the creditor did not file action against the son's estate, would the creditor succeed in an action against the father for $200?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the creditor had detrimentally relied on the father's promise.","Yes, because the father's promise was supported by a bargained-for exchange.","No, because the creditor's claim against the son's estate was worthless.","No, because the father at most had only a moral obligation to pay the son's debts.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The father sought the creditor's forbearance in exchange for the father's promise to pay the creditor. It makes no difference that the creditor's consideration benefited a third party instead of the father.

A is not the best answer because promissory estoppel based on detrimental reliance is only relevant when there is not an enforceable contract. Since there is an enforceable contract between the father and the creditor, detrimental reliance will not be the basis for the success of the creditor's action. C is incorrect because if the creditor believed in good faith that his claim against the son's estate was valid, then the forbearance of his legal right to sue is adequate consideration. D is incorrect because the father's payment is not based on his moral obligation. Instead, the father's promise to the pay the creditor was made in exchange for the creditor's promise not to exercise his legal right to bring suit against the son's estate.","Formation of Contracts"

"15. Buyer and Seller (both merchants)  agree over the phone that Seller will sell the Buyer 500 metal tubes at $5 each. Buyer informs the Seller that the tubes will be incorporated into one of his products. The parties do not discuss Buyer's remedies in the event of Seller's default. The next day, Seller sends a ""Confirmation"" to Buyer. The confirmation recites the quantity and price but states that in the event of a breach by Seller, the Buyer's only remedy is to return the defective goods and recover the purchase price. Seller ships the tubes to Buyer, which accepts delivery and incorporates the tubes into one of its products. Subsequently, Buyer finds that the tubes are defective and the products are unsaleable. Buyer sues and seeks to recover damages. Which of the following is correct?",multiple-choice,"Buyer can recover its damages because the remedies limitation in the ""Confirmation"" was a material alteration of the oral agreement.","Buyer can recover its damages because the default terms of the UCC apply unless the parties writings agree on a different term.","Seller will prevail because the limitation on remedies in his Confirmation was a condition that Buyer accepted by accepting delivery.","Seller will prevail because Buyer did not object to limitation on remedies within reasonable time.",,,1,"A  A written confirmation of an oral agreement operates as an acceptance even if it states terms different from the terms of the agreement.

However, in transactions between merchants, the additional terms might become part of the contract unless they contain material alterations of the original terms. UCC §2-207(2)(b) (deleted under 2003 revisions). Here, the language limiting the remedies of the Buyer on Seller's default was a sufficiently material alteration to be excluded from the bargain. *Choice Bis not correct under existing law but will become correct if the 2003 revisions become law. If the parties had not made an agreement at all, UCC §2-207(3) might produce the result in choice B. But if the term had not been material, Buyer's silence might have been deemed an acceptance, producing an agreement that would obviate recourse to UCC §2-207(3). Thus, choice Bis true only if choice Already prevented the term from becoming part of the contract. Choice A, then, is a better answer. Choice Cis not correct. The limitation was not an express condition to acceptance of delivery, but a material change imposed by the Seller's form of Confirmation. Choice Dis incorrect because an objection is unnecessary when the additional term materially alters the agreement.","Contract Terms"

He may wish merely to compare the price of one supplier against the price of a competitor. A price quotation is, therefore, not always an offer. The facts, in this case, would indicate that Seller was merely stating a price in anticipation of Paul's order. Since Paul did not respond until Seller changed the price after the forest fire, there was no agreement between the parties. Choice A is incorrect because the April 1 letter was not a firm offer but a price quotation. Choice Bis not the best answer because the facts are not dispositive on the issue of practicability. We are not told what the impact of the fire on Seller will be. If he is able to sell his inventory at the increased price, there may be no impact at all. Choice C is not the right answer because Paul was not entitled to rely on the April 1 quotation, especially since his order was placed only after he had received notice of the price increase.","Formation of Contracts"
"17. Neff and Owens owned adjoining residences in Smithville. In May, they hired a contractor to lay a continuous sidewalk running in front of both their homes. Each man was to pay the contractor for that part of the work measured by the width of his property. After he had paid the bill that the contractor submitted to him, Neff reasonably (but erroneously) became convinced that the contractor had mistakenly charged him for labor and materials that were used for that part of the sidewalk in front of Owen's home. Neff asked Owens to reimburse him for the amount that he thought he had erroneously paid the contractor. After a lengthy discussion, and although he believed that he owed Neff nothing, Owens finally said: I want to avoid trouble, so if you agree to forgo the money, Ill hire a caretaker to keep our sidewalks free of ice and snow this winter. Neff orally agreed.

Owens decided to go to Florida for the winter. He left without hiring anyone to remove snow and ice in front of either property. When the first snow fell and the sidewalk was not cleared, Neff cleaned his own sidewalk and then kept it clean the rest of the winter.

As between the retailer and the wholesaler, which of the following is an accurate statement?",multiple-choice,"No contract was formed, because of wholesaler's June 10 sale of the rifles to another merchant revoked the offer to the retailer.","If a contract was formed, it is voidable because of mutual mistake.","If a contract was formed, it is unenforceable because of supervening impracticability.","No contract was formed, because the retailer's June 11 rejection was effective on dispatch.",,,3,"Answer B or C is correct. A party's obligation under a contract may be discharged on grounds of mutual mistake if the mistake related to a basic assumption of the contract having a material effect on the exchange, and if the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the mistake. Similarly, a party's obligation under a contract may be discharged on grounds of supervening impracticability if the impracticability is due to an event, the nonoccurrence of which is a basic assumption of the contract, occurring without the fault of either party, and where the party seeking discharge should not bear the risk of the event. Because the federal statute criminalizes the performance required under the contract (the interstate sale of assault rifles), it relates to a basic assumption of the contract and renders performance impracticable for both the retailer and the wholesaler. Because neither party had reason to know that the statute would be enacted, neither party should bear the risk of the event.

Choice A is incorrect because revocation of an offer is only effective when the offeree receives notice of the revocation. Choice D is incorrect because notice of a rejection is effective upon receipt (the mail box rule only applies to an acceptance).","Formation of Contracts"
"When a woman's 21-year-old daughter finished college, the woman handed her a signed memorandum stating that if she would go to law school for three academic years, she would pay her tuition, room, and board and would ""give her a $1,000 bonus"" for each ""A"" she got in law school. The daughter's uncle who was present on this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to the daughter, ""and if she doesn't pay your expenses, I will."" The woman paid her tuition, room, and board for her first year but died just before the end of that year. Subsequently, the daughter learned that she had received two ""A's"" in the second semester. The executor of the woman's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two ""A's"" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school.

In an action against the woman's estate for $2,000 on account of the two ""A's"" if the only defense raised is lack of consideration, the daughter probably will",multiple-choice,"succeed under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.","succeed on a theory of bargained-for exchange for her mother's promise.","not succeed, because the $1,000 for each ""A"" was promised only as a bonus.","not succeed, because the daughter was already legally obligated to use her best efforts in law school.",,,2,"Answer B is correct because the woman's promise to pay the daughter for each ""A"" is part of a bargained-for exchange. The promise of the payment induced the daughter to go to law school. An economic benefit to the promisor is not required; the gratification from influencing the daughter is sufficient to establish bargained-for consideration. The mother's death does not change the contract, and the estate will be liable for her promise to the daughter. Answer A is incorrect because promissory estoppel applies only in the absence of consideration. Answer C is incorrect because the promise of payment for each ""A"" was a factor in inducing the daughter to go to law school. Answer D is incorrect because the daughter had no prior legal obligation to go to law school or to earn ""A's.""","Formation of Contracts"
"A notorious spendthrift, who was usually broke for that reason, received the following letter from his uncle, a wealthy and prudent man: ""I understand you're in financial difficulties again. I promise to give you $5,000 on your birthday next month, but you'd better use it wisely or you'll never get another dime from me."" The spendthrift thereupon signed a contract with a car dealer to purchase a $40,000 automobile and to make a $5,000 down payment on the day after his birthday.

If the spendthrift sues his uncle for $5,000 after the latter learned of the car-purchase contract and then repudiated his promise, which of the following is the uncle's best defense?",multiple-choice,"A promise to make a gift in the future is not enforceable.","Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless the value of the promised gift is substantially equivalent to the promisee's loss by reliance.","Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless that reliance also results in an economic benefit to the promisor.","Reliance by the promisee on a promise to make a future gift does not make the promise enforceable unless injustice can be avoided only by such enforcement.",,,4,"D is correct. Under the theory of detrimental reliance, a gratuitous promise may be enforceable notwithstanding lack of consideration if the party making the promise has reason to expect the promise will induce reliance on the part of the promisee, there has been reliance in fact, and injustice may be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The uncle should have foreseen that his promise would induce action on the spendthrift's part, which it in fact did. However, the nature of the spendthrift's reliance (buying a car that he could not afford) is inconsistent with the intended purpose of the uncle's gift, which suggests that justice does not require enforcement of the promise.

A is incorrect. Some gift promises are enforceable under a reliance theory. B and C are incorrect. Reliance does not require equivalence between the value of the promise and the extent of the reliance, nor does it require the reliance to confer a benefit on the promisor.","Formation of Contracts"
"An agent engaged an inexperienced actress to do a small role in a new Broadway play for a period of six months at a salary of $200 a week. The actress turned down another role in order to accept this engagement. On the third day of the run, the actress was hospitalized with influenza and a replacement was hired to do the part. A week later, the actress recovered, but the agent refused to accept her services for the remainder of the contract period. The actress then brought an action against the agent for breach of contract.

Which of the following is the actress's best legal theory?",multiple-choice,"Her acting contract with the agent was legally severable into weekly units.","Her performance of the literal terms of the contract was physically impossible.","Her reliance on the engagement with the agent by declining another acting role created an estoppel against the agent.","Her failure to perform for one week was not a material failure so as to discharge the agent's duty to perform.",,,4,"D is correct. Under the Doctrine of Constructive Conditions, a party's material breach of an obligation, if uncured, may discharge the other party's obligation under the contract. Therefore, the agent's obligation may only be discharged if the actress's inability to perform for one week is found to be a material breach. Whether the breach will be found to be material will depend on a number of factors, including the prospect that the actress may cure the breach, whether damages are available to compensate the agent for the harm suffered and the degree to which the actress's failure to perform substantially deprived the agent of his expected benefit under the contract. If the actress is found not to have materially breached, then the agent's failure to accept her services for the remainder of the engagement would, in turn, be found to be a material breach. This answer offers the best legal theory because none of the other answers offer the actress a basis for arguing breach of contract.

A is incorrect. Even if the contract were severable, it is not relevant to whether the agent's remaining obligation to engage the actress may be discharged.

B is incorrect. Although impossibility of performance could provide a basis for excuse for the actress, it would not support the actress's argument that the agent breached the contract.

C is incorrect. The issue presented is not whether the agent owed a duty to the actress on the basis of reliance or otherwise (he clearly did, based on the agreement between them), but rather whether the agent breached that duty.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A woman bought on credit and took delivery of a telescope from a seller for an agreed price of $100. The woman promised to pay the seller, ""as soon as I am able."" The woman subsequently repudiated this promise and refused to pay the seller anything.

What effect does this quoted language have on enforceability of the promise?",multiple-choice,"It makes the promise voidable.","It makes the promise illusory.","It requires the woman to prove her inability to pay.","It requires the seller to prove the woman's ability to pay.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms, the promisor unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances (e.g., ""I'll buy it if I feel like it.""). Such a promise is an illusory promise. The modern approach, however, is to construe a promise wherever possible so as not to be illusory. This can be done, for example, by reading into the promise an obligation to exercise discretion in good faith. So long as the promisor has limited her freedom of action in some way, the court will find consideration sufficient to enforce the return promise. When the woman promised to pay $100 ""as soon as I am able,"" she limited her freedom of action in that she will become obligated to pay the purchase price when it can be demonstrated that she has the ability to pay.

A is incorrect.  A voidable promise occurs when a party to the contract has the power to disaffirm the agreement.  This occurs when there a legal reason to render the agreement unenforceable including fraud, duress and infancy.  As stated above, there is valid consideration to enforce the return promise.  Therefore, it is not a voidable promise.

B is incorrect because a court will construe the quoted language as limiting the woman's freedom of action in some way. This limitation will be sufficient consideration to enforce the return promise. C is incorrect because the seller (and not the woman) will bear the burden of demonstrating that the condition has been satisfied.","Formation of Contracts"
"21. Paul walks past a building that is under construction. Dan is about six feet behind Paul when he notices a loose brick falling from the top of
the building. Dan rushes at Paul and pushes him in the back to get him out of the bricks path. The brick misses Paul but shatters Dans hand and forearm. Grateful for Dans help in avoiding a blow that might have killed him, Paul comforts Dan as he lies on the sidewalk, writhing in pain. He says, ""You saved my life. Ill never be able to repay you, but I will pay all your hospital and medical expenses. And Ill pay whatever income you lose while you're mending."" In too much pain to speak, Dan nods.

Later, Paul refuses to pay Dan any money. In an action to enforce the alleged promise in a jurisdiction that follows the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"Dan will prevail because it would be unjust not to enforce Pauls promise.","Paul will prevail because he did not request Dans assistance.","Paul will prevail because there was no consideration for his promise to Dan.","Paul will prevail because Dan did not unequivocally accept his offer.",,,1,"A  The question requires us to construe the facts under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. The Restatement follows the minority view in cases involving promises to pay for past humanitarian acts. The majority view is that these promises are not enforceable for lack of consideration. The Restatement, on the other hand, follows the decision in Webb v. McGowin on the theory that the promisee received a material benefit and it would be unjust to allow him to avoid his promise. Rest. 2d §86(1). Under these facts, it's clear that Dan probably saved Paul's life, to his own detriment. Under the Restatement, his promise will be enforceable. Choice B is wrong because the Restatement does not require that the promisor request the services. In a case such as this one, the services arise under circumstances that make a request impossible. Choice C is incorrect because under the Restatement no consideration is required. Choice D is incorrect because no response by Dan was required. The facts indicate that he did nod, but the result would be the same even if he were unable to respond at all. What makes Paul's promises enforceable under the Restatement view is the underlying notion that the contrary result would create an injustice.","Formation of Contracts"
"22. Questions 22-23 are based on the following fact situation:

On December 20, Carl, the owner of Carls Coffee Shop, entered into a written contract with Dan, owner of Dan's Doughnut Factory, under which Carl agreed to purchase from Dan all his doughnut requirements for the next calendar year. The contract provided that ""Carl shall have no obligation to accept any specified quantity of doughnuts, but only all his daily requirements and that Dan ""agrees to supply your requirements at a fixed price per dozen specified in the contract, cash on delivery. During the year, Carls requirements of doughnuts averaged approximately 50 dozen per week.

The parties renewed the contract for a second year. After three months, Dan experienced a rise in his costs and decided he could no
longer afford to supply Carls requirements at the price fixed in their agreement.

If Dan asserts that the agreement is not binding on him because of lack of consideration, will Dan prevail?",multiple-choice,"Yes,because requirements contracts lack mutuality of obligation.","Yes,because the provision that Carl had no obligation to accept any specified quantity made the contract illusory.","No, because requirements contracts do not need consideration to be enforceable.","No, because Carls agreement to buy his requirements was sufficient consideration for Dans agreement to supply those requirements.",,,4,"D  The modern view, as represented in the UCC, is that neither party to an output or requirements contract can evade obligation with impunity, but may avoid the obligation only if, in good faith, they have no requirements or output. UCC §2-306. Agreement to accept this limitation is consideration. Choice Ais incorrect because mutuality of obligation is not required (as long as consideration exists). Rest. 2d §79(c). In addition, both parties have obligations to act in good faith. Choice Bis incorrect because the facts tell us that Carl had an obligation to purchase all of his doughnuts from Dan. Carl cannot withdraw from the contract at will, but is committed to buy from Dan unless, in good faith, Carl has no requirements for doughnuts. The contract was not illusory. Choice Cis not the best answer because it implies that consideration is not needed to support a requirements contract. The UCC rules create obligations that satisfy the requirement of consideration, but do not create an exception to the requirement.","Formation of Contracts"
"23. Questions 22-23 are based on the following fact situation:

On December 20, Carl, the owner of Carls Coffee Shop, entered into a written contract with Dan, owner of Dan's Doughnut Factory, under which Carl agreed to purchase from Dan all his doughnut requirements for the next calendar year. The contract provided that ""Carl shall have no obligation to accept any specified quantity of doughnuts, but only all his daily requirements and that Dan ""agrees to supply your requirements at a fixed price per dozen specified in the contract, cash on delivery. During the year, Carls requirements of doughnuts averaged approximately 50 dozen per week.

Assume instead of the facts in question 22 that six months into the second year of the contract, Carl opened Carls Coffee Shop No. 2 in a new office building. In the previous four months, Carl had ordered an average of 50 dozen doughnuts per week from Dan. The first week after the opening of the second shop,he ordered 75 dozen doughnuts, explaining that he needed the larger quantity for the two shops. Dan refused to supply any more than 50 dozen at the price fixed in the agreement.

Is Dan justified in his refusal?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because Carl demanded an unreasonably large increase over the prior needs.","Yes, because the opening of Carls Coffee Shop No. 2 was an unanticipated occurrence that excused Dan from his contract with Carl.","No, because the agreement provided that Dan would supply Carls requirements of doughnuts at the fixed price.","No, if in opening Carls Coffee Shop No.2, Carl relied on his requirements contract with Dan.",,,1,"A  A requirements or output contract involving the sale of goods must meet the test of fairness and good faith — that is, “no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or, in the absence of a stated estimate, to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements, may be tendered or demanded.” UCC §2-306(1). Since Carl's prior requirements had been 50 dozen doughnuts per week, the increase to 75 dozen doughnuts (a 50 percent increase) would probably be considered unreasonably disproportionate to the parties' prior dealings. Choice Bis incorrect because there is no rule of law that permits the supplier to a requirements contract to refuse to perform because of an “unanticipated occurrence” external to and independent of the buyer's requirements. Choice Dis incorrect because a buyer is not entitled to rely on a requirements contract to create new outlets and then insist on deliveries unreasonably disproportionate to his previous orders.

"24. Joan (a consumer) purchased a three-piece living room set from Norton, Inc., a local dealer. Norton presented loan with a three-page agreement, signed by Norton's president at the foot of the document, above a signature line under which his name was typed. Joan signed the contract on a line parallel to the presidents after her name was typed underneath. On page 2, the contract contained a clause that stated that it could not be modified, except in a writing signed by both parties. Joan did not place her signature or her initials alongside this clause. loan paid for the set by paying $200 down and agreeing to pay an additional $500 in five monthly installments. She paid the first two installments and then noticed a long tear in the back of a sofa. She went to the store and demanded a refund. Norton suggested instead that they reduce the remaining payments to $50 per month instead of $100. Joan agreed but refused to make any further payments. Norton sued for $300. 

Based on these facts, What is the likely result?",multiple-choice,"Norton will prevail because the agreement to reduce the price was not in writing. ","Joan will prevail because she was not bound by the no-oral-modification clause.","Norton will prevail because Joan signed the agreement.","Norton will prevail because there was no consideration for its agreement to reduce the price.",,,2,"B  A consumer who deals with a merchant is at a disadvantage when required to sign an agreement on the merchant's form. In recognition of this, the UCC frowns on contract clauses that prevent modification of contracts between merchant and customer except by a writing. These are called no-oral-modification clauses. The clause will be ineffective unless it is separately initialed or signed by the customer. UCC §2-209(2). Under these facts, Joan did not sign or initial the no-oral-modification clause and was not bound by it. Her oral agreement with Norton to reduce the price is therefore effective against Norton's efforts to recover the full price. Choice Ais wrong because the agreement to reduce the price did not have to be in writing. Joan was not bound by the no-oral-modification clause. Choice Cis incorrect because, although Joan signed the agreement itself, she did not separately sign the no-oral-modification clause. Choice Dis incorrect because contracts for the sale of goods are an exception to the general rule that contracts may not be modified if the modification benefits only one party; between seller and buyer, a modification needs no consideration. UCC §2-209(1). (Note: If the new agreement was deemed an accord rather than a modification, Joan's failure to perform the accord might permit Norton to sue on the original agreement. Rest. 2d §281.

"25. Ben applied to ABC Bank for a loan to expand his florist business. ABC agreed in writing to make the loan. The writing specified that the loan would be repaid within six months, at interest of 10 percent per annum, a legal rate in that state. The writing was countersigned by Ben. Before the closing and delivery of the funds, however, the loan officer indicated that ABC might need the guarantee of Joe Smith, Ben's wealthy uncle. Ben verbally assured the officer that the guaranty would be no problem. The loan closed without the guarantee. The next day, the officer called Ben and informed him that Joe Smiths guarantee was necessary after all. Ben approached Ioe with ABCs standard guarantee form and requested his signature. Joe signed the guarantee and Ben delivered it to ABC. Despite the infusion of funds, Ben's business has failed, and he is unable to repay the loan. ABC asks Joe to honor his guarantee. Joe refuses to pay, and ABC sues.

","Joe Smith will prevail because there was no consideration for the guarantee executed by him.","Joe Smith will prevail because ABC closed the loan before asking for the guarantee.",,,2,"B  If a guarantee is not given until the principal debt has already been created, there would appear to be no consideration to support the guarantee. This is the view of many jurisdictions. However, the more modern view is that if the guarantee is in writing, it will be enforceable. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts requires that the writing make some references to a purported consideration, even if none is really paid. Rest. 2d §88(a). The UCC is even more liberal; it requires only that the guarantee be in writing — no recital of consideration is necessary. Under these facts, the written guarantee of Ben's Uncle Joe would be clearly enforceable by ABC Bank. Choice Ais incorrect because, although it was clearly the motivating force behind the guarantee, the relationship between Ben and Joe is not necessary to support the guarantee; the guarantee of a friend would be treated in the same way.

An acceptance is ordinarily effective when it is dispatched. Anna's offer did not stipulate a specific mode of acceptance, and, in any event, Ella used the same means as Anna — a wire. Because Ella's wire was sent before Anna's revocation was received by her, Ella's acceptance was valid. Choice Bis incorrect because a revocation may be made by any reasonable means. In this instance requiring speed, a telephone call was certainly reasonable. However, the call came too late. Ella had already dispatched her acceptance.

Because Anna did not suspect that Sam might recover, she did not condition her offer to Anna on his continued incapacity. Choice Ais incorrect on the facts as stated. Anna's offer made no mention of the possibility that Sam might recover; on the contrary, it cited Sam's illness as the reason for requesting Ella's appearance. Choice Bis incorrect. Although illness will sometimes operate to excuse default in a personal services contract, Sam's illness was relevant only to Sam's performance, not to Ella's. Choice Cis wrong.

Rest. 2d §32. Under these facts, Anna's wire could certainly be interpreted as soliciting either or both. She wanted to know if someone would appear, but she wanted even more to obtain an appearance. Stella was reasonable to conclude that she didn't have to wait to communicate with Anna but could just pack her bags and show up at the door. Anna had wired, “You must arrive no later than June 29,” not “Let me know if you're coming.” Choice D is incorrect because, as we have seen, some offers can be accepted either by a return promise or by performance.
            Choice B is wrong because it is not Stella's best argument. Anna could not reasonably be charged with knowledge that Stella would cancel another engagement, and in any event, Stella can rely on her appearance as a valid acceptance entitling her to be paid her usual fee. Choice C is wrong because Anna's wire was at least ambiguous as to whether it expected a response other than performance (Stella's appearance).","Formation of Contracts"
"A buyer faxed the following signed message to his long-time widget supplier: ""Urgently need blue widgets. Ship immediately three gross at your current list price of $600."" Upon receipt of the fax, the supplier shipped three gross of red widgets to the buyer, and faxed to the buyer the following message: ""Temporarily out of blue. In case red will help, am shipping three gross at the same price. Hope you can use them.""

Upon the buyer's timely receipt of both the shipment and the supplier's fax, which of the following best describes the rights and duties of the buyer and the supplier?",multiple-choice,"The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, or he must reject the shipment and recover from the supplier for total breach of contract.","The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, or he may reject the shipment, in which case he has no further rights against the supplier.","The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, less any damages sustained because of the nonconforming shipment, or he may reject the shipment and recover from the supplier for total breach of contract, subject to the supplier's right to cure.","The buyer may accept the shipment, in which case he must pay the supplier the list price, less any damages sustained because of the nonconforming shipment, or he may reject the shipment provided that he promptly covers by obtaining conforming widgets from another supplier.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the UCC, an order of goods for prompt shipment may be construed as inviting acceptance by a shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods. However, if the seller indicates that the shipment of non-conforming goods is offered as an accommodation to the buyer, the shipment will be construed as a counteroffer instead of an acceptance. Because the seller's note indicates that he shipped red widgets to accommodate the buyer, his shipment of red widgets was not an acceptance of the buyer's offer and therefore was also not a breach of contract. A is incorrect because if the buyer rejects the shipment, there is no contract and the buyer has no right to recover damages against the supplier. C and D are incorrect because the accommodating shipment is a counteroffer, so there will be no recovery of damages against the supplier if it is accepted.","Formation of Contracts"
"An elderly widower lived alone on a small farm which he owned. Except for the farm, including the house and its furnishings, the widower owned substantially no property. Under proper management, the farm was capable of producing an adequate family income, but the widower was unable to do farm work or even to provide for his own personal needs. The widower entered into an oral contract with his nephew by which the widower agreed to convey the farm to his nephew if the nephew moved into the house with the widower, operated the farm, and took care of the widower for the rest of his life. The oral contract was silent as to when the land was to be conveyed. The nephew, who lived about fifty miles away where he was operating a small business of his own, terminated his business and moved in with the widower. With the assistance of his wife, the nephew gave the widower excellent care until the widower died intestate about five years after the date of the contract.

In his final years the widower was confined to his bed and required much personal service of an intimate and arduous sort. The widower was survived by his only son who was also the widower's sole heir. The son resided in a distant city and gave his father no attention in his father's final years. The son showed up for the widower's funeral and demanded that the nephew vacate the farm immediately. Upon the nephew's refusal to do so, the son brought an appropriate action for possession. The nephew answered by way of a counterclaim to establish the nephew's right to possession and title to the farm.

If the court's decision is in favor of the nephew, it will be because",multiple-choice,"the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part performance as will result in an irreparable hardship if the contract is not performed.","the land is located in a state where the Statute of Frauds will not be applied if there has been such part performance that is by its very nature unequivocally referable to the contract.","the son is precluded by the ""clean hands"" doctrine from enforcing his claim against the nephew.","the blood relationship of uncle-nephew is sufficient to remove the necessity for any writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Part performance standing alone does not make a contract that is within the Statute of Frauds enforceable. Those jurisdictions adopting the approach in Restatement section 129 allow specific enforcement of a promise to convey land if the party seeking enforcement ""in reasonable reliance on the contract and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought, has so changed his position that injustice can only be avoided by specific enforcement."" The nephew's reliance and hardship are demonstrated by the following facts: The nephew terminated his business and moved fifty miles to care for the widower and fully performed by continuing to care for the widower for five years, the final years of which required ""intimate and arduous care.""

B is incorrect because although the nephew moved onto the property with the widower, the nephew did not take sole possession and make improvements or other such acts as would unequivocally refer to the contract for the transfer of title to the land. C is incorrect because the son did not engage in inequitable conduct in a transaction with the nephew. The ""clean hands"" doctrine applies only if inequitable conduct relates to the transaction for which he seeks relief - the oral agreement between the nephew and the widower. D is incorrect because a blood relationship does not remove a transaction from the Statute of Frauds and, in fact, may require stronger evidence that the transaction was a contract.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"In a writing signed by both parties on December 1, a man agreed to buy from a distributor a gasoline engine for $1,000, delivery to be made on the following February 1. Through a secretarial error, the writing called for delivery on March 1, but neither party noticed the error until February 1. Before signing the agreement, the man and the distributor orally agreed that the contract of sale would be effective only if the man notified the distributor in writing no later than January 2 that the man had arranged to resell the engine to a third person. Otherwise, they agreed orally, ""There is no deal."" On December 15, the man entered into a contract with a mechanic to resell the engine to the mechanic at a profit.

On December 16, the man notified the distributor by telephone of the man's resale agreement with the mechanic, and explained that a written notice was not feasible because the man's secretary was ill. The distributor replied, ""That's okay. I'll get the engine to you on February 1, as we agreed."" Having learned, however, that the engine had increased in value about 75% since December 1, the distributor renounced the agreement on February 1.

If the man sues the distributor on February 2 for breach of contract, which of the following concepts best supports the man's claim?",multiple-choice,"Substantial performance.","Nonoccurrence of a condition subsequent.","Waiver of condition.","Novation of buyers.",,,3,"C is correct. A condition is an event that is not certain to occur, which must occur, unless excused, before performance under a contract becomes due. The man and the distributor's agreement was subject to an express condition. They agreed that the contract of sale would not come into effect unless the man provided written notice of resale on or before January 2; this condition, in fact, did not occur. Although nonoccurrence of the condition normally would excuse each party's obligation under the contract, in this case, the distributor waived the nonoccurrence of the condition when she verbally agreed on December 16 to send the engine without written notice.

A is incorrect. Substantial performance of a condition is not sufficient when the condition is express. B is incorrect. The nonoccurrence of the condition was waived (in any event, the condition at issue here is a condition precedent). D is incorrect. The facts do not indicate a novation.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1,000. However, upon the wife's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of the husband. The property had been purchased by the husband from an inheritance.

After the wife died, the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: ""In consideration of [the man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby promise to pay [the man] $1,000.""

Upon the husband's death, the man filed a claim for $1,000. The husband's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration.

With respect to the recital that the man had agreed not to file a claim against the husband's estate, what additional fact would most strengthen the man's claim?",multiple-choice,"The man's agreement was made in a writing he signed.","The man reasonably believed he had a valid claim when the instrument was signed.","The wife had contributed to accumulation of the real property.","The man paid the husband $1 when he received the instrument.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. A promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient consideration to support a return promise even if the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person surrendering the claim has a good-faith belief in its validity. As long as the man genuinely believed that he had a valid claim against the husband, his promise to relinquish such claim provides sufficient consideration to support the husband's promise to pay the man $1,000. 

A is incorrect because a writing would not excuse an absence of consideration. C is incorrect because the tenancy in the entirety would preclude her devise to the man. D is incorrect because some courts will find that the payment of nominal consideration in exchange for a promise is a ""mere pretense"" of a bargain and is not enforceable.","Formation of Contracts"
"On December 15, a lawyer received from a retailer of supplies an offer consisting of its catalog and a signed letter stating, ""We will supply you with as many of the items in the enclosed catalog as you order during the next calendar year. We assure you that this offer and the prices in the catalog will remain firm throughout the coming year.""

Assume that on January 15, having at that time received no reply from the lawyer, the retailer notified the lawyer that effective February 1, it was increasing the prices of certain specified items in its catalog.

Is the price increase effective with respect to catalog orders the retailer receives from the lawyer during the month of February?",multiple-choice,"No, because the retailer's original offer, including the price term, became irrevocable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.","No, because the retailer is a merchant with respect to office supplies; and its original offer, including the price term, was irrevocable throughout the month of February.","Yes, because the retailer received no consideration to support its assurance that it would not increase prices.","Yes, because the period for which the retailer gave assurance that it would not raise prices was longer than three months.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the UCC's firm offer rule, an offer by a merchant for the sale of goods contained in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it is firm will be irrevocable, notwithstanding lack of consideration, for the time stated in the offer, but in no case may the period of irrevocability exceed three months. The retailer is a merchant, because it is a retailer of office supplies. The offer that it sent to the lawyer is a firm offer because it was made by a merchant, is contained in a signed writing, and provides the necessary assurances. The fact that the period of irrevocability exceeds three months does not invalidate the firm offer, but the offer will only be firm for a three-month period. Because, as of January 15, the three-month period had not yet elapsed, the offer is still firm and the retailer is not free to change the prices contained in the December 15 offer.

A is incorrect because the facts do not show substantial reliance on the offer. C is incorrect because UCC firm offers do not require consideration to be enforceable. D is incorrect because, as explained above, when the offer purports to be firm for more than three months, the firm offer is not invalidated but rather is irrevocable for three months.","Formation of Contracts"
"A seller contracted in writing to deliver to a buyer 100 bushels of wheat on August 1 at $3.50 a bushel. Because his suppliers had not delivered enough wheat to him by that time, the seller on August 1 had only 95 bushels of wheat with which to fulfill his contract with the buyer.

If the seller tenders 95 bushels of wheat to the buyer on August 1, and the buyer refused to accept or pay for any of the wheat, which of the following best states the legal relationship between the seller and the buyer?",multiple-choice,"The seller has a cause of action against the buyer, because the seller has substantially performed his contract.","The seller is excused from performing his contract because of impossibility of performance.","The buyer has a cause of action against the seller for the seller's failure to deliver 100 bushels of wheat.","The buyer is obligated to give the seller a reasonable time to attempt to obtain the other five bushels of wheat.",,,3,"C is correct. Under the UCC's perfect tender rule, when a delivery under a contract for the sale of goods fails to conform in any respect to the contract, the buyer has the right to reject the delivery and, if the defective delivery is not timely cured, pursue remedies for breach of contract. Since the seller promised to deliver 100 bushels of wheat on August 1 and delivered only 95 bushels on that date, the buyer is entitled to reject the delivery and claim damages for breach.

A is incorrect. Under the perfect tender rule, substantial performance is insufficient to satisfy the constructive condition. B is incorrect. The mere failure of a supplier to deliver goods to a seller ordinarily would not provide a basis for excuse on grounds of impossibility. D is incorrect. The buyer is only obligated to allow the seller an opportunity to cure the defect if the time for performance is not yet due, or if the seller reasonably thought that the delivery would be conforming.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A landowner was the owner of a large subdivision. A purchaser became interested in purchasing a lot but could not decide between Lot 40 and Lot 41. The price and fair market value of each of those two lots was $5,000. The purchaser paid the landowner $5,000, which the landowner accepted, and the landowner delivered to the purchaser a deed which was properly executed, complete, and ready for recording in every detail except that the space in the deed for the lot number was left blank. The landowner told the purchaser to fill in either Lot 40 or Lot 41 according to his decision and then to record the deed. The purchaser visited the development the next day and completely changed his mind, selecting Lot 25. He filled in Lot 25 and duly recorded the deed. The price of Lot 25 and its fair market value was $7,500.

Before the landowner had time to learn of the purchaser's actions, the purchaser sold Lot 25 to a neighbor for $6,000 by a duly and properly executed, delivered, and recorded warranty deed. The neighbor knew that the landowner had put a price of $7,500 on Lot 25, but he knew no other facts regarding the landowner-purchaser transaction. The neighbor's attorney accurately reported the purchaser's record title to be good, marketable, and free of encumbrances. Neither the neighbor nor his attorney made any further investigation outside the record. The landowner brought an appropriate action against the neighbor to recover title to Lot 25. If the landowner loses, the most likely basis for the judgment is that",multiple-choice,"the Statute of Frauds prevents the introduction of any evidence of the landowner's and the purchaser's agreement.","recording of the deed from the landowner to the purchaser precludes any question of its genuineness.","as between the landowner and a bona fide purchaser, the landowner is estopped.","the clean hands doctrine bars the landowner from relief.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A bona fide purchaser for value is one who takes without notice before delivery of conveyance or payment of the purchase price and is protected as to reasonable expectations arising from the apparent ownership of his assignor. Although the neighbor knew of the $1,500 price differential, this was insufficient to put him on reasonable notice that he should inquire regarding the purchaser's ownership interest in Lot 25. Thus, the landowner would be estopped from claiming superior title to the neighbor, a bona fide purchaser.

A is incorrect because the Statute of Frauds does not prevent the introduction of evidence of a contract for a purpose other than to enforce the contract. B is incorrect because a recorded deed creates only a rebuttable presumption that it is genuine. D is incorrect because the ""clean hands"" doctrine bars an equitable remedy to one who has been guilty of unlawful or inequitable conduct in a transaction from which he seeks relief. The landowner, who had no knowledge of the purchaser's selection of Lot 25 and subsequent attempted sale to a third party, was not guilty of inequitable or unlawful conduct.","Third-Party Rights"

He says, If you'll go to college instead of taking that no end job at the beer factory, Ill pay your tuition, and, if you get all As, I'll buy you a new car. Corey enrolls at the local college, where he gets a B average. When Corey asks Alex for the tuition and the car, the older man says, I never meant to give you the money or the car. But think what Ive done for you. You know now that you can get good grades and a decent education. Thats my gift to you. 

Corey consults you and asks whether he has a cause of action against Alex. You will advise him",multiple-choice,"You can recover your tuition payments, but not the purchase price for a new vehicle.","You can recover the purchase price of a new vehicle, but not your tuition expenses.","You have no cause of action because there was no consideration for your grandfathers promise.","You have no cause of action because your grandfathers promise was not in writing.",,,1,"A  A promise to make a gift that anticipates that the promisee will either perform some act or refrain from performing some act in reliance on the promise is enforceable under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Consideration is not required. The doctrine will be applied especially in the case of intrafamily relationships. Here, Corey gave up his job and enrolled in a college, all in reliance on his grandfather's promise. To the extent that Corey did these things, the grandfather's promise will be enforced. (Note: Because Corey went to college, as Alex requested, many courts would find Corey gave consideration.) However, Corey did not satisfy the condition Alex imposed — he did not get an all-A average. This condition limited the obligation to pay for a new car, but not the promise to pay tuition. Choice Ais therefore correct, but choice Bis not. Choice Cis not correct because consideration is not required in those cases in which promissory estoppel applies. Choice Dis wrong, even though the agreement cannot be performed within a year. Once Corey has fully performed, the promise is removed from the Statute of Frauds. Rest. 2d §130. An exception for reliance under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §139 also would apply, but might limit Corey to recovery of the reliance interest. Because tuition was a reliance expense, the two provisions seem likely to produce the same result in this case.","Formation of Contracts"
"A rancher and a fancier of horses signed the following writing: ""For $5,000, the rancher will sell to the fancier a gray horse that the fancier may choose from among the grays on the rancher's ranch.""

The fancier refused to accept delivery of a gray horse timely tendered by the rancher or to choose among those remaining, on the ground that during their negotiations the rancher had orally agreed to include a saddle, worth $100, and also to give the fancier the option to choose a gray or a brown horse. The fancier insisted on one of the rancher's brown horses, but the rancher refused to part with any of his browns or with the saddle as demanded by the fancier.

If the fancier sues the rancher for damages and seeks to introduce evidence of the alleged oral agreement, the court probably will",multiple-choice,"admit the evidence as to both the saddle and the option to choose a brown horse.","admit the evidence as to the saddle but not the option to choose a brown horse.","admit the evidence as to the option to choose a brown horse but not the promise to include the saddle.","not admit any of the evidence.",,,2,"B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars the introduction of evidence of an agreement made prior to the adoption of a final written contract if the prior agreement relates to matters within the scope of the writing. However, if the prior agreement does not contradict the writing but merely supplements it, evidence of the prior agreement may be admitted if the court finds that the writing is only partially integrated (it did not encompass their entire agreement). Since the written agreement between the rancher and the fancier provides for the sale of a gray horse, evidence of an oral agreement to sell a brown horse contradicts the writing and would therefore be excluded under the rule. On the other hand, evidence relating to the rancher's alleged promise to include a saddle merely supplements the writing, and therefore a court is likely to consider extrinsic evidence on this issue if it finds that the writing is only partially integrated rather than completely integrated.

A and C are incorrect. The evidence relating to the option to choose a brown horse contradicts the writing. D is incorrect. The modern approach to the parol evidence rule permits extrinsic evidence to be admitted to determine whether the writing is partially or completely integrated.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to a collector. On February 1, the broker obtained such a coin from a hoarder in exchange for $1,000 and the broker's signed, written promise to re-deliver to the hoarder ""not later than December 31 this year"" a comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge to the hoarder. On February 2, the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the collector.

On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid, sustained rise; on October 15 the hoarder wrote the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. The broker replied, ""In view of the surprising market, it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks.""

After receiving the broker's message on October 17, the hoarder telephoned the broker, who said, ""I absolutely will not replace your coin until the market drops far below its present level."" The hoarder then sued the broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February. The trial began on December 1.

If the broker moves to dismiss the hoarder's complaint, which of the following is the hoarder's best argument in opposing the motion.",multiple-choice,"The hoarder's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in enforcement of the contract required her to mitigate her losses on the rising market by suing promptly, as she did, after becoming reasonably apprehensive of a prospective breach by the broker.","Although the doctrine of anticipatory breach is not applicable under the prevailing view if, at the time of repudiation, the repudiatee owes the repudiator no remaining duty of performance, the doctrine applies in this case because the hoarder, the repudiatee, remains potentially liable under an implied warranty that the coin advanced to the broker was genuine.","When either party to a sale-of-goods contract repudiates with respect to a performance not yet due, the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may in good faith resort to any appropriate remedy for breach.","Anticipatory repudiation, as a deliberate disruption without legal excuse of an ongoing contractual relationship between the parties, may be treated by the repudiatee at her election as a present tort, actionable at once.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Under the UCC, when either party to a contract for the sale of goods repudiates the contract with respect to a future performance that will substantially affect the value of that performance, the non-repudiating party may resort to any appropriate remedy for breach. A repudiation is an unequivocal statement of inability or unwillingness to perform. The broker's October 17 statement that he ""absolutely will not"" replace the hoarder's coin until the market drops manifests such an intent; therefore the hoarder is entitled to treat his statement as a total breach of contract, even though performance is not due until December 31.

A is incorrect because an injured party must act reasonably to mitigate damages only after the other party commits a material breach or repudiates the contract. B is incorrect because, although the common law recognizes an exception where the non-repudiating party owes no remaining duty of performance, the UCC rule (which governs the hoarder-broker contract because it is for the sale of a good) provides for no such exception. D is incorrect because repudiation typically does not entitle the non-repudiating party to bring a tort action.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A bottling company sent a purchase order to a wholesaler that stated, ""Ship 100,000 empty plastic bottles at the posted price."" Two days after receipt of this purchase order, the wholesaler shipped the bottles and the bottling company accepted delivery of them. A week after the bottles were delivered, the bottling company received the wholesaler's acknowledgement form, which included a provision disclaiming consequential damages. After having used the wholesaler's bottles in its bottling operations for two months, the bottling company discovered a defect in the bottles that caused its products to leak from them. The bottling company recalled 10,000 of the bottles containing its product, incurring lost profits of $40,000.

Assuming all appropriate defenses are timely raised, will the bottling company likely succeed in recovering $40,000 in consequential damages from the wholesaler?",multiple-choice,"No, because buyers are generally not entitled to recover consequential damages.","No, because the bottling company's acceptance of the goods also constituted an acceptance of the terms included in the wholesaler's acknowledgement.","Yes, because the disclaimer of consequential damages is unconscionable.","Yes, because the wholesaler's acknowledgement did not alter the terms of an existing contract between the parties.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206, an offer to buy goods for prompt shipment is accepted when the seller ships the goods. The contract was created in this case when the wholesaler shipped the bottles. The terms consisted of the negotiated terms plus UCC gap-fillers. The subsequent acknowledgment form was an ineffective effort to modify the terms, and the bottling company did not accept the proposed modification.

Answer A is incorrect. This answer misstates the rule concerning consequential damages. Buyers generally are entitled to recover consequential damages, subject to certain specified limitations such as the requirement that damages, to be recoverable, must be foreseeable at the time the contract was made. The contract was created in this case when the wholesaler shipped the bottles. The terms consisted of the negotiated terms plus UCC gap-fillers. The subsequent acknowledgment form was not accepted by the bottling company, and never became part of the contract. There are no facts that would support an exception to the general rule that buyers are entitled to recover consequential damages, and the bottling company will prevail.

Answer B is incorrect. The terms of a contract for the sale of goods are established upon acceptance of an offer. Under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206, an offer to buy goods for prompt shipment is accepted when the seller ships the goods. Because the bottling company's acceptance (shipment of the bottles) occurred PRIOR to the receipt of the acknowledgment form, the acknowledgement form was an ineffective attempt to modify the parties' contract. The bottling company did not accept the proposed modification, and it will in fact recover consequential damages.

Answer C is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the bottling company will recover consequential damages, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. While disclaimers of consequential damages might sometimes be found unconscionable, the mere existence of such a disclaimer is not enough to establish unconscionability, and there is no evidence in this case that would otherwise suggest that the contract was unconscionable. The bottling company will recover consequential damages, however, because the acknowledgement form was an ineffective attempt to modify the terms of the parties' contract. Under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206, an offer to buy goods for prompt shipment is accepted when the seller ships the goods. The contract was created in this case when the wholesaler shipped the bottles. The terms consisted of the negotiated terms plus UCC gap-fillers. The subsequent acknowledgment form was not accepted by the bottling company and never became part of the contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"A mill and a bakery entered into a written contract that obligated the mill to deliver to the bakery 1,000 pounds of flour every Monday for 26 weeks at a specified price per pound. The mill delivered the proper quantity of flour in a timely manner for the first 15 weeks. However, the 16th delivery was tendered on a Tuesday, and amounted to only 800 pounds. The mill told the bakery that the 200-pound shortage would be made up on the delivery due the following Monday.

The mill's proposed cure, the delivery of the remaining 200 pounds on the following Monday, is sufficient given that the late delivery and the shortage will not significantly disrupt the bakery's business.

The mill's proposed cure, the delivery of the remaining 200 pounds on the following Monday, is sufficient given that the late delivery and the shortage will not significantly disrupt the bakery's business. Accordingly, the buyer has no right to reject the tender or to cancel the contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A building owner and a purchaser made a written contract pursuant to which the building owner promised to convey a specified apartment house to the purchaser in return for the purchaser's promise (1) to convey a 100-acre farm to the building owner, and (2) to pay the building owner $1,000 in cash six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm. The contract contained the following provision: ""It is understood and agreed that the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1,000 six months after the exchange of the apartment house and the farm shall be voided if the building owner has not, within three months after the aforesaid exchange, removed the existing shed in the parking area in the rear of the said apartment house.""

The building owner's removal of the shed from the parking area of the apartment house is",multiple-choice,"a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.","a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.","a condition subsequent to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.","not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000.",,,1,"A is correct. This question deals with the difference between conditions precedent, conditions concurrent, and conditions subsequent. A condition precedent is one that must occur before an absolute duty of immediate performance arises in the other party. Conditions concurrent are conditions the can occur together with both parties bound to perform at the same time. A condition subsequent is one which cuts off an existing duty of performance when it occurs. Here, the obligation to remove the shed will give rise to the purchaser's duty to pay the $1,000. Therefore, it functions as a condition precedent to that duty. However, the condition is worded so the failure to remove the shed by the three-month deadline will extinguish the purchaser's obligation to pay the $1,000, making it a condition subsequent in form. Thus, B, C, and D are incorrect.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On June 1, a manufacturer of men's neckties received the following order from a retailer: ""Ship 500 two-inch ties, assorted stripes, your catalogue No. V34. Delivery by July 1.""

On June 1, the manufacturer shipped 500 three-inch ties that arrived at the retailer's place of business on June 3. The retailer immediately telegraphed the manufacturer: ""Reject your shipment. Order was for two-inch ties."" The retailer, however, did not ship the ties back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer replied by telegram: ""Will deliver proper ties before July 1."" The retailer received this telegram on June 4, but did not reply to it.

On June 30, the manufacturer tendered 500 two-inch ties in assorted stripes, designated in his catalogue as item No. V34, but the retailer refused to accept them.

Did the retailer properly reject the ties tendered on June 30?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was a present breach of contract.","Yes, because the manufacturer's shipping the three-inch ties on June 1 was an anticipatory repudiation.","No, because the manufacturer cured the June 1 defective delivery by his tender of conforming goods on June 30.","No, because a contract for sale of goods can be modified without consideration.",,,3,"C is correct. When the retailer rejected the ties, the agreed time for performance (July 1) had not expired. Thus, the manufacturer, who had performed in good-faith and who notified the retailer of an intent to cure by shipping conforming ties, could do so as long as the conforming delivery was made within the agreed time.

A is incorrect. Although the shipment on June 1 was a breach of contract, the manufacturer preserved the right to cure before July 1. B is incorrect. Anticipatory repudiation consists of an indication by the seller through words or conduct that the contract would not be completed. Here, the manufacturer did the opposite and assured the retailer that the proper ties would be delivered before July 1. D is incorrect. The contract was not modified; 500 two-inch ties were delivered by July 1.",Remedies
"A breeder bought a two-month-old registered boar at auction from a seller for $800. No express warranty was made. Fifteen months later, tests by experts proved conclusively that the boar had been born incurably sterile. If this had been known at the time of the sale, the boar would have been worth no more than $100.

In an action by the breeder against the seller to avoid the contract and recover the price paid, the parties stipulate that, as both were and had been aware, the minimum age at which the fertility of a boar can be determined is about 12 months.

Which of the following will the court probably decide?",multiple-choice,"The breeder wins, because the parties were mutually mistaken as to the boar's fertility when they made the agreement.","The breeder wins, because the seller impliedly warranted that the boar was fit for breeding.","The seller wins, because the breeder assumed the risk of the boar's sterility.","The seller wins, because any mistake involved was unilateral, not mutual.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of mutual mistake of fact if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract having a material effect on the exchange, unless the court determines that the party asserting mistake should bear the risk of the mistake. The effect of the mistake was material to the value of the exchange in this case, as it reduced the boar's value from $800 to $100. But the boar's fertility is not a fundamental assumption of the contract, because both parties knew that fertility could not yet be determined at the time of sale. In addition, although the breeder could not have investigated whether the boar was fertile at the time of sale, it seems likely that the court nonetheless would find that the breeder implicitly assumed the risk of the boar's infertility, since the breeder was aware of this possibility yet went forward with the purchase.

A is incorrect because, as explained above, it is unlikely that the court would find mistake on these facts. B is incorrect because the facts do not suggest such an implied term since both parties were aware that such a determination was not possible at the time of the contract. D is incorrect because a unilateral mistake would apply where one but not the other party was operating under mistake at the time of the contract; in this case, neither party could have known at the time of the contract whether the boar was sterile.","Formation of Contracts"
"A buyer ordered a new machine from a manufacturer. The machine arrived on time and conformed in all respects to the contract. The buyer, however, rejected the machine because he no longer needed it in his business and returned the machine to the manufacturer. The manufacturer sold many such machines each year, and its factory was not operating at full capacity. 

In an action by the manufacturer against the buyer for breach of contract, which of the following is NOT a proper measure of the manufacturer's damages?",multiple-choice,"The contract price of the machine.","The difference between the contract price and the market price of the machine.","The difference between the contract price and the price obtained from a proper resale of the machine.","The profit the manufacturer would have made on the sale of the machine to the buyer.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The manufacturer does not have an action for the price. Such an action is available under three circumstances, none of which is present here—(1) where the buyer has accepted the goods, (2) where the goods are lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after the risk of loss has passed to the buyer, or (3) where the buyer has returned or rejected the goods and the seller is unable after reasonable efforts to resell the goods. UCC § 2-709 

Answer B is incorrect. UCC § 2-708(1) gives a seller the right to recover the difference between the contract price and the market price of goods when a buyer has wrongfully rejected the goods. Note, however, that because the manufacturer is a lost volume seller, it would be better off seeking damages under UCC § 2-708(2), since it is unlikely that a market differential formula will result in the recovery of any direct damages by the manufacturer with respect to what appear to be standard goods. 

Answer C is incorrect. UCC -706 allows a seller to recover the difference between the contract price and resale price when a buyer has wrongfully rejected the goods. Note, however, that the manufacturer would be better off seeking damages under UCC § 2-708(2), because it is a lost volume seller and it is unlikely that a resale will result in the recovery of any direct damages by the manufacturer with respect to what appear to be standard goods. 

Answer D is incorrect. UCC § 2-708(2) provides the lost volume seller (a seller not operating at full capacity) with an action to recover lost profit. A recovery under UCC § 2-708(2) would adequately compensate the manufacturer for its direct damages.",Remedies
"An automobile retailer had an adult daughter who needed a car in her employment but had only $3,000 with which to buy one. The retailer wrote to his daughter, ""Give me your $3,000 and I'll give you the car on our lot that we have been using as a demonstrator."" The daughter thanked her father and paid him the $3,000. As both the retailer and his daughter knew, the demonstrator was reasonably worth $10,000. After the daughter had paid the $3,000, but before the car had been delivered to her, one of retailer's sales staff sold and delivered the same car to a customer for $10,000. Neither the salesperson nor the customer was aware of the transaction between the retailer and his daughter.

Does the daughter, after rejecting a tendered return of the $3,000 by her father, have an action against him for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the retailer's promise was supported by bargained-for consideration.","Yes, because retailer's promise was supported by the moral obligation a father owes his child as to the necessities of modern life.","No, because the payment of $3,000 was inadequate consideration to support the retailer's promise.","No, because the salesperson's delivery of the car to the customer made it impossible for the retailer to perform.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. In order to be enforceable, a promise must be supported by bargained-for consideration. Consideration is bargained for if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for the promise. The retailer's promise to give his daughter the car was supported by consideration because the promise was conditioned upon the daughter's promise to pay her father $3,000. Answer B is incorrect because moral obligation does not suffice as consideration. Answer C is incorrect because courts at law do not inquire into the adequacy of considerations exchanged. Answer D is incorrect because the fact that the car was sold to a third party does not discharge the retailer's contractual obligation to sell the car to his daughter, although the daughter may be limited to recovering monetary damages.","Formation of Contracts"
"A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim ""to pay from any settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries."" The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were ""non-assignable."" The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from the doctor, but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise.

After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote the doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney.

The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor. The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor. The victim remains insolvent.

In an action by the doctor against the attorney upon the attorney's employment contract with the victim, the attorney is likely to argue in defense that",multiple-choice,"the anti-assignment clause in the attorney's contract with the victim is void as against public policy.","the attorney has relied to his detriment on the victim's letter of release.","third parties cannot acquire valid claims under an attorney-client contract.","the doctor has not materially changed his position in reliance upon the attorney's employment contract.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise, such as where the promisor must know that the promisee intended to confer a benefit on the beneficiary. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary unless and until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise or manifests assent to the promise at the request of the promisor or promisee. The doctor appears to be an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the victim and the attorney, since the promise to pay ""any physician"" who treats the victim's injuries manifests an intent by the parties to confer standing on the doctor to enforce the promise. The doctor's rights as beneficiary did not vest, however, before the victim and the attorney discharged the duty when they executed the release. Although the doctor received notice of the promise, he did not rely on it, since the services were rendered before he received notice of the promise.

A is incorrect because the promise that the doctor seeks to enforce is the promise to pay and not the anti-assignment clause. B is incorrect because the issue is whether the doctor's rights as beneficiary had vested, regardless of any reliance by the attorney. C is incorrect because the attorney-client relationship is not relevant to whether the doctor could acquire standing to enforce the attorney's promise to pay.","Third-Party Rights"
"Responding to the county's written advertisement for bids, a tire salesman was the successful bidder for the sale of tires to the county for the county's vehicles. The tire salesman and the county entered into a signed, written agreement that specified, ""It is agreed that the tire salesman will deliver all tires required by this agreement to the county in accordance with the attached bid form and specifications, for a one-year period beginning September 1, 1990."" Attached to the agreement was a copy of the bid form and specifications. In the written advertisement to which the tire salesman had responded, but not in the bid form, the county had stated, ""Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best interests of the county."" No definite quantity of tires to be bought by the county from the tire salesman was specified in any of these documents.

In January 1991, the tire salesman learned that the county was buying some of its tires from one of the tire salesman's competitors. Contending that the tire salesman-county agreement was a requirements contract, the tire salesman sued the county for the damages caused by the county buying some of its tires from the competitor.

If the county defends by offering proof of the advertisement concerning the possibility of multiple awards, should the court admit the evidence?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the provision in the written agreement, ""all tires required by this agreement,"" is ambiguous.","Yes, because the advertisement was in writing.","No, because of the parol evidence rule.","No, because it would make the contract illusory.",,,1,"A is correct. The parol evidence bars the introduction of evidence of a prior agreement that contradicts the terms of a final written contract. Notwithstanding the parol evidence rule, however, such evidence may be introduced to explain an ambiguity in the written contract. The written contract between the tire salesman and the county provided for the sale to the county of ""all tires required by this agreement."" It is not clear whether this language manifests an intent by the parties to enter into a requirements contract, which is a type of sales contract that obligates the buyer to purchase all of its requirements of a good from the seller. Because the written contract is ambiguous on this issue, the advertisement may be admitted to demonstrate that the county was not obligated to purchase tires exclusively from the tire salesman.

B is incorrect. The parol evidence rule also applies to written promises made prior to the adoption of a final writing. C is incorrect. An exception to the parol evidence rules applies here. D is incorrect. The admissibility of evidence does not depend on whether a contract is illusory.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A fugitive was wanted for murder. The authorities offered the following reward: ""$20,000 to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest and conviction of this fugitive."" A private detective knew of the reward, located the fugitive, and brought him to the authorities, who arrested him. The authorities then determined that while the fugitive had, in fact, committed the crime, he had been directed to commit the crime by his boss. The authorities and the fugitive then agreed that in exchange for the fugitive's testimony against his boss, all charges against the fugitive would be dropped. The fugitive testified and was released. The authorities refused to pay the reward to the private detective on the ground that the fugitive was never convicted.

Would the private detective be likely to prevail in a breach of contract action against the authorities?",multiple-choice,"No, because the private detective failed to notify the authorities that he had accepted the reward offer.","No, because the express conditions set out in the reward were not met.","Yes, because the authorities' agreement with the fugitive was against public policy.","Yes, because the authorities themselves prevented the conviction of the fugitive.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the condition occurs or its nonoccurrence is excused. The detective's entitlement to the reward was subject to two conditions: the arrest and conviction of the fugitive. The first, the arrest, was satisfied when the detective delivered the fugitive to the authorities. The second, the conviction, did not occur. Its nonoccurrence is excused, however, under the doctrine of prevention, which requires that a party refrain from conduct that prevents or hinders the occurrence of a condition. Here, the authorities hindered the occurrence of the second condition by negotiating a deal with the fugitive and dropping the charges against him. 

Answer A is incorrect. In an offer for a unilateral contract, an offeree who accepts by rendering the requested performance is required to give notice only if the offeree has reason to know that the offeror would not learn of the requested performance with reasonable certainty and promptness. Such is not the case here since the offeror learned of the performance when the detective took the fugitive to the authorities. 

Answer B is incorrect. The general rule is that a party's performance does not become due until all express conditions to it have occurred or are excused. In this case, the detective’s entitlement to the reward was subject to two conditions—the arrest and the conviction of the fugitive. The failure of the latter condition—conviction—is excused under the doctrine of prevention, which requires that a party refrain from conduct that prevents or hinders the occurrence of a condition, because the authorities themselves prevented the fugitive's conviction from occurring. 

Answer C is incorrect. This answer is nonresponsive because it relates to the enforceability of the agreement between the fugitive and the authorities rather than the enforcement of the purported contract between the authorities and the detective. The dispositive issue is the effect of the nonoccurrence of an express condition. In this case, the detective's entitlement to the award was subject to two conditions: the arrest and conviction of the fugitive. The failure of the latter condition—conviction—is excused under the doctrine of prevention, which requires that a party refrain from conduct that prevents or hinders the occurrence of a condition, because the authorities themselves prevented the fugitive's conviction from occurring.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: ""I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident."" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries.

Which of the following provides most significant information in determining whether or not there was bargained-for consideration to support the father's promise to the physician?",multiple-choice,"The physician had not begun treating the woman before the father called him.","The father had a contract with the woman.","The father had a contract with the woman and the physician had not begun treating the woman before the father called him.","The son died from his injuries before the physician had begun treating the woman.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. When a preexisting duty was owed to a third party, courts may hold that a new promise to do the same action is not sufficient as consideration. If the father had a contract with the woman to pay for all losses, then he had a preexisting duty to pay the physician. Therefore, the father's subsequent promise to the physician to pay the bill may not constitute consideration as he was already obligated to pay under his contract with the woman. Thus, the father's promise to pay was not bargained-for in exchange for the physician's promise to treat the woman. Both the timing of the father's call and the existence of a contract between the woman and the father are significant in determining whether there was bargained-for consideration to support the father's promise to pay the physician. If an action was already performed before the promise was made, it will not qualify as consideration because it was not ""bargained-for."" Therefore, if the father's promise to pay the physician was made after the physician began treating the woman, then the physician's treatment of the woman will not constitute consideration.

A is incorrect. The sole fact that the physician had not started treating the woman before the father called him is not enough information to determine if there was bargained-for consideration.

B is incorrect. We do not know if the physician had begun treating the woman before or after the father's promise to pay. As stated above, the timing is significant in determining whether there was bargained-for consideration to support the father's promise to pay the physician. Therefore, the fact that there was a contract between the father and the woman is not enough information.

D is incorrect. The son’s death does not impact the agreement made between the father and the physician. The timing of any promise made between the father and the woman compared with any promise made between the father and the physician is what is at issue. The father would still be responsible for his promises whether or not the son had survived.","Formation of Contracts"
"A borrower asked a lender to lend her $1,000. The lender replied that he would do so only if the borrower's father would guarantee the loan. At the borrower's request the father mailed a signed letter to the lender: ""If you lend $1,000 to my daughter, I will repay it if she doesn't."" On September 15, the lender having read the father's letter, lent $1,000 to the borrower, which the borrower agreed to repay in installments of $100 plus accrued interest on the last day of each month beginning October 31. The father died on September 16. Later that same day, unaware of the father's death, the lender mailed a letter to the father advising that he had made the $1,000 loan to the borrower on September 15.

The borrower did not pay the installments due on October 31, November 30, or December 31, and has informed the lender that she will be unable to make repayments in the foreseeable future.

Assume that the borrower's entire $1,000 debt is due and that she has failed to repay any part of it.

In an action by the lender against the father's estate for $1,000 plus accrued interest, which of the following is true regarding the father's promise to pay?",multiple-choice,"There was no consideration to support the father's promise, because he did not receive any benefit.","The father died before the lender accepted his offer.","The father died before the lender notified him that his offer had been accepted.","The father's letter was a unilateral contract accepted by performance.",,,4,"D is the correct answer. A unilateral contract is a contract created by an offer that can only be accepted by performance. Here, the father's letter could only be accepted by the lender lending $1,000 to the borrower. Generally the offeree is not required to give the offeror notice that he has begun the requested performance, but is required to notify the offeror within a reasonable time after performance has been completed. Therefore, when the lender made the loan to the borrower on the 15th, the contract was effectively accepted even if the father had not yet been notified. Thus, the father's death on the 16th does nothing to render the promise made in his letter to the lender ineffective.

A is incorrect. In order to constitute consideration (i) there must be a bargained-for-exchange between the parties; and (ii) there must be a benefit to the promisor or detriment to the promisee. Here, the father wanted the lender to lend the $1,000 to his daughter. The loan was to his benefit. Therefore, there was consideration.

B is incorrect because the father died on September 16th. The lender accepted the father's offer on September 15th, when he lent $1,000 to the borrower.

C is incorrect. Although the father died without knowing that his offer had been accepted, the offeree is not required to give the offeror notice that he has begun the requested performance. The offeree must give notice within a reasonable time after performance has begun. Here, the lender mailed a letter on September 16th, the day after he had lent the $1,000 to the borrower. Therefore, the lender fulfilled his notice requirement.","Formation of Contracts"
"A manufacturer of computers pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5 percent on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. The manufacturer's sales people are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission, the salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer.

In 2006, a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation for a $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with the corporation's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to develop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised the corporation, with the manufacturer's knowledge and approval, to assist the corporation for six months after installation in making the equipment work.

On January 1, 2007, the corporation signed an order, and on March 1, the computer was installed. On March 15, the manufacturer fired the salesperson on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 2005 and 2006 sales quotas. The salesperson thought that the manufacturer was correct in this statement. A coworker was thereupon assigned to service the corporation account. On March 31, the manufacturer billed the corporation for the computer.

Assume that the manufacturer's termination of the salesperson's employment was not wrongful. If the salesperson sues the manufacturer for the reasonable value of his services, which of the following is the most likely result?",multiple-choice,"The salesperson will win, because the manufacturer benefited as a result of the salesperson's services.","The salesperson will win, because the manufacturer made an implied-in-fact promise to pay a reasonable commission for services that result in sales.","The salesperson will lose, because there is an express contractual provision pre-empting the subject of compensation for his services.","The salesperson will lose, because he cannot perform his agreement to assist the customer for six months.",,,3,"C is correct.

A is incorrect. The salesperson was being paid a monthly salary for his services. When the salesperson conferred a benefit to the manufacturer, he had no reasonable expectation of the sale commission unless he met the express terms of his agreement.

B is incorrect. The manufacturer's express contract with the salesperson is inconsistent with an implied agreement to pay a reasonable commission, and the express language controls.

D is incorrect because the salesperson's right to the commission is not dependent upon servicing the contract; rather, it is dependent upon his employment status on the date that the customer is billed.",Remedies
"A computer retail outlet contracted to service a bank's computer equipment for one year at a fixed monthly fee under a contract that was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. Three months later, the retail outlet sold the service portion of its business to an experienced and well-financed computer service company. The only provision in the agreement between the retail outlet and the computer service company relating to the outlet's contract with the bank stated that the outlet ""hereby assigns all of its computer service contracts to [the computer service company]."" 

The computer service company performed the monthly maintenance required under the service contract. Its performance was defective, however, and caused damage to the bank's operations. 

Whom can the bank sue for damages arising from the computer service company's defective performance?",multiple-choice,"The retail outlet only, because the computer service company made no promises to the bank.","Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because the bank has not released the outlet and the bank is an intended beneficiary of the outlet's agreement with the computer service company.","Either the retail outlet or the computer service company, because since each has the right to enforce the bank's performance of its contract with the retail outlet, mutuality of remedy renders either potentially liable for the defective performance.","The computer service company only, because it is a qualified and a financially responsible supplier of computer services.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The retail outlet effectively delegated to the computer service company the outlet's duty of performance owed to the bank. However, absent consent by the obligee (the bank) or performance by the delegatee (the computer service company), an effective delegation does not relieve the delegating party (the retail outlet) of its duty to the obligee. When the computer service company purchased the service contracts, the bank also became an intended beneficiary of the computer service company's promise to the retail outlet. The computer service company expressly agreed with the retail outlet to perform the outlet's obligation to the bank, making the bank an intended beneficiary of that obligation. Thus, both the retail outlet and the computer service company remain liable to the bank.

Answer A is incorrect. The computer service company expressly agreed with the retail outlet to perform the outlet's obligation to the bank, thus imposing a duty on the computer service company of which the bank was an intended beneficiary. Therefore, the bank is also entitled to sue the computer service company for its defective performance.

Answer C is incorrect. Assuming an effective assignment, the right of the retail outlet to the bank's performance was extinguished. It is true that the bank can sue either the retail outlet or the computer service company, but it can do so (a) because the bank has not released the outlet and (b) because the bank is an intended beneficiary of the outlet's agreement with the computer service company.

Answer D is incorrect. The competence and financial responsibility of the retail outlet's delegate, the computer service company, will not discharge the retail outlet's obligation to the bank. The retail outlet effectively delegated to the computer service company the outlet's duty of performance owed to the bank. However, absent consent by the obligee (the bank) or performance by the delegatee (the computer service company), an effective delegation does not relieve the delegating party (the retail outlet) of its duty to the obligee.","Third-Party Rights"
"A girl, who was a minor both in fact and appearance, bought on credit and took delivery of a telescope from a thirty year-old seller for an agreed price of $100. Soon after reaching the age of majority, the girl encountered the seller and said, ""I am sorry for not having paid you that $100 for the telescope when the money was due, but I found out it was only worth $75. So, I now promise to pay you $75."" The girl subsequently repudiated this promise and refused to pay anything.

In an action for breach of contract by the seller against the girl, the seller's probable recovery is",multiple-choice,"nothing, because the girl was a minor at the time of the original transaction.","nothing, because there was no consideration for the promise made by the girl after reaching majority.",$75.,$100.,,,3,"Answer C is correct. Normally, promises made in recognition of a past benefit conferred (such as the girl's promise to pay the seller $75) are not enforceable because any benefit received by the girl was not bargained-for (the telescope was not given in exchange for the $75). As an exception to the rule, courts will enforce such a promise if the promise reaffirms a promise made pursuant to an earlier bargained-for exchange that was not enforceable at the time because of infancy. Although the girl's earlier promise to pay $100 for the telescope was not enforceable because the girl lacked capacity to contract, her later promise to pay $75 for the telescope is enforceable: first, because the girl no longer lacks capacity to contract; and second, because her subsequent promise falls within the exception to the rule and is enforceable notwithstanding the lack of consideration.

A is incorrect because the issue is not the enforceability of the original contract, but rather that of the subsequent promise. B is incorrect because the girl's subsequent promise falls within the exception to the rule. D is incorrect because only the subsequent promise is enforceable because at the time of that promise, the girl had reached the age of majority.","Formation of Contracts"

If the computer company sues the bank for breach of contract, which of the following facts, if proved, will best support a recovery by the computer company?",multiple-choice,"The delay did not materially harm the bank.","The computer company believed, on the assumption that the bank was getting a ""super deal"" for its money, that the bank would not reject because of the late tender of delivery.","The computer company's delay in tender was caused by a truckers' strike.","A usage in the relevant trade allows computer sellers a 30-day leeway in a specified time of delivery, unless the usage is expressly negated by the contract.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, any trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity in a place, vocation, or trade so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can be introduced to interpret the parties' agreement, so long as the usage can be reasonably construed as being consistent with the express terms of the contract. Indeed, the UCC defines ""agreement"" as including the parties' express terms as well as those that are implied by applicable trade usage. Although the written contract between the computer company and the bank called for delivery ""on or before July 31,"" the trade usage that the computer company seeks to introduce suggests that buyers should allow for up to 30-days' leeway beyond that date. If the contract were construed in light of this usage, then the August 15 delivery would not be a breach of the contract and the bank would be in breach for refusing to take delivery on that date. The fact that buyers and sellers typically negate the usage with express language if the delivery date is to be construed strictly suggests that the trade usage is fairly persuasive evidence of the parties' intent.

A is incorrect because even an immaterial delay in delivery would entitle the bank to reject delivery of the computer. B is incorrect because such an inference would not be reasonable if the contract is literally construed as requiring delivery ""on or before July 31."" C is incorrect because a truckers' strike would not justify excuse on grounds of impracticability, because the facts do not suggest that the availability of ground shipment is a basic assumption on which the contract was made.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A man sent an email to a friend that stated: ""Because you have been a great friend to me, I am going to give you a rare book that I own."" The friend replied by an email that said: ""Thanks for the rare book. I am going to give you my butterfly collection."" The rare book was worth $10,000; the butterfly collection was worth $100. The friend delivered the butterfly collection to the man, but the man refused to deliver the book. 

If the friend sues the man to recover the value of the book, how should the court rule?",multiple-choice,"For the man, because there was no bargained-for exchange to support his promise.","For the man, because the consideration given for his promise was inadequate.","For the friend, because she gave the butterfly collection to the man in reliance on receiving the book.","For the friend, because she conferred a benefit on the man by delivering the butterfly collection.",,,1,"A is correct. To constitute consideration, a return promise must be bargained for. A return promise is bargained for when it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise. Because the man's promise to give the rare book to the friend did not seek a return promise or performance, the friend's promise to give the man her butterfly collection did not constitute consideration for the man's promise. Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should rule in favor of the man. 

B is incorrect. Instead of giving inadequate consideration, the friend gave no consideration at all. To constitute consideration, a return promise must be bargained for. A return promise is bargained for when it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise. Because the man's promise to give the rare book to the friend did not seek a return promise or performance, the friend's promise to give the man her butterfly collection did not constitute consideration for the man's promise. Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should rule in favor of the man. 

C is incorrect. Although it is true that a promisee's reliance may provide the basis for the enforcement of a promise in the absence of consideration, that principle is inapplicable here. The man's promise failed to induce reliance by the friend of the type that the man reasonably might have expected when he promised to give her the rare book. In addition, this is not a case in which injustice could only be avoided by the enforcement of the man's promise. The dispositive issue here is whether the friend's promise to give her butterfly collection to the man constituted consideration for the man's promise. Because the man's promise to give the rare book to the friend did not seek a return promise or performance, the friend's promise did not constitute consideration for the man's promise. Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should rule in favor of the man. 

D is incorrect. The fact that a promisee confers a benefit on a promisor does not create an enforceable obligation on the part of the promisor. The dispositive issue here is whether the friend's promise to give her butterfly collection to the man constituted consideration for the man's promise. Because the man's promise to give the rare book to the friend did not seek a return promise or performance, the friend's promise did not constitute consideration for the man's promise. Accordingly, no contract arose between the parties, and the court should rule in favor of the man.","Formation of Contracts"
"During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city. In early 2007 the city's City Council adopted this resolution:

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here.
The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 ""for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire."" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward.

Which of the following best characterizes the relationship between the store and the detective?",multiple-choice,"A unilateral offer of employment by the store which became irrevocable for a reasonable number of days after the detective commenced his investigation of the store's arson.","An employment for compensation subject to a condition precedent that the detective succeeds in his investigation.","A series of daily bilateral contracts, the store exchanging an express promise to pay the daily rate for the detective's implied promise to pursue his investigation with reasonable diligence.","A series of daily unilateral contracts, the store exchanging an express promise to pay the daily rate for the detective's daily activity of investigating the store's arson.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The written memorandum called for the detective to ""perform"" by ""investigating the fire."" Thus, it was unilateral, and it specified a daily rate of pay for ""each day's work.""

A is incorrect because an option contract at law is created when the offeree begins performance in response to a unilateral offer, which makes the offer irrevocable to allow the offeree a reasonable opportunity to complete performance. Given the language ""for each day's work you actually perform,"" a reasonable opportunity would not extend beyond a single day. B is incorrect because the language does not expressly require that the detective successfully investigate before the duty to pay will arise, but instead states that the detective will be paid for each day's investigation. C is incorrect because the language of the offer calls for performance, not a promise, and every contract, whether unilateral or bilateral, imposes upon parties a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.","Formation of Contracts"
"On March 1, a homeowner contacted a builder about constructing an addition to the homeowner's house. The builder orally offered to perform the work for $200,000 if his pending bid on another project was rejected. The homeowner accepted the builder's terms and the builder then prepared a written contract that both parties signed. The contract did not refer to the builder's pending bid. One week later, upon learning that his pending bid on the other project had been accepted, the builder refused to perform any work for the homeowner.

Can the homeowner recover for the builder's nonperformance?",multiple-choice,"No, because efficiency principles justify the builder's services being directed to a higher-valued use.","No, because the builder's duty to perform was subject to a condition.","Yes, because the builder's attempt to condition his duty to perform rendered the contract illusory.","Yes, because the parol evidence rule would bar the builder from presenting evidence of oral understandings not included in the final writing.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The homeowner cannot recover for the builder's nonperformance based on the oral condition to the contract. Normally, the parol evidence rule bars from evidence prior or contemporaneous negotiations and agreements that contradict, modify, or vary contractual terms if the contract is intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement. However, the condition exception to the parol evidence rule permits the admission of extrinsic evidence to establish an oral condition to the parties' performance under the contract. Here, the builder's acceptance of the contract was conditioned on the rejection of his bid on another project. This condition was not written in the contract. However, as explained above, this oral condition will be allowed into evidence as an exception to the parol evidence rule. Because the builder's bid was accepted on the other project, the condition in the contract did not occur, and the builder will not be in breach of the contract. Thus, Answer B is correct, and Answer D is incorrect. 

Answer A is incorrect. Although contract law supports the principle of efficient breach, the principle does not discharge a breaching party's duty to perform or its responsibility to compensate the non-breaching party for damages arising from the breaching party's failure to perform. In this case, however, the condition exception to the parol evidence rule permits the admission of extrinsic evidence to establish the oral condition to the parties' performance under the contract, which, because it was not satisfied, discharged the builder's duty to perform. 

Answer C is incorrect. The builder made a definite commitment to perform even though his duty to perform was conditioned on his other bid being rejected. The builder's promise to perform was not illusory, because the possibility that the condition might occur limited the builder's freedom of action by binding him to perform if the condition was satisfied. In this case, however, the condition exception to the parol evidence rule permits the admission of extrinsic evidence to establish the oral condition to the parties' performance under the contract, which, because it was not satisfied, discharged the builder's duty to perform.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"On March 1, an apartment complex received a letter from a retailer offering to sell the apartment complex 1,200 window air conditioners suitable for the apartments in the complex's buildings. The retailer's offer stated that it would remain open until March 20, but that the apartment complex's acceptance must be received on or before that date. On March 16, the apartment complex posted a letter of acceptance. On March 17, the retailer telegraphed the apartment complex to advise that it was revoking the offer. The telegram reached the apartment complex on March 17, but the apartment complex's letter did not arrive at the retailer's address until March 21.

As of March 22, which of the following is a correct statement?",multiple-choice,"The telegram revoking the offer was effective upon receipt.","The offer was revocable at any time for lack of consideration.","The mail was the only authorized means of revocation.","Under the terms of the retailer's offer, the apartment complex's attempted acceptance was ineffective.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the mail box rule, an acceptance is effective upon dispatch in the mail if a mailed acceptance is invited by the terms of the offer. However, if the offer specifies otherwise, the language of the offer controls. Although the retailer's offer stated that the apartment complex's acceptance must be received on or before March 20, the apartment complex's attempted acceptance did not arrive until the 21st and therefore it was ineffective.

Answer A is incorrect because, although revocations generally are effective upon receipt, this one would not have been effective if the apartment complex's acceptance had arrived on or before March 20. Answer B is incorrect because, although offers generally are revocable, the retailer's offer would not have been revocable once the apartment complex had accepted it (if it was accepted before the offer lapsed). Answer C is incorrect because generally revocation can be effected by any means.","Formation of Contracts"
"A lender contended that a borrower owed him $6,000. The borrower denied that he owed the lender anything. Tired of the dispute, the borrower eventually signed a promissory note by which he promised to pay the lender $5,000 in settlement of their dispute.

In an action by the lender against the borrower on the promissory note, which of the following, if true, would afford the borrower the best defense?",multiple-choice,"Although the lender honestly believed that $6,000 was owed by the borrower, the borrower knew that it was not owed.","Although the lender knew that the debt was not owed, the borrower honestly was in doubt whether it was owed.","The original claim was based on an oral agreement, which the Statute of Frauds required to be in writing.","The original claim was an action on a contract, which was barred by the applicable Statute of Limitations.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Unilateral modifications of contractual obligations lack consideration under the preexisting duty rule and therefore may be unenforceable. However, a promise to surrender a legal claim is sufficient consideration to support a return promise even if the claim turns out to be invalid, so long as the person surrendering the claim has a good faith belief in its validity. Because the borrower may argue that the unilateral modification of the debt is unenforceable due to the preexisting duty rule, the lender may argue that his promise to settle the claim provided sufficient consideration. The lender's argument will not succeed, however, if the lender knew that the claim was not valid.

A is incorrect because, since it is the lender's promise to settle that must furnish the necessary consideration, it is his good faith belief in the claim's validity that is relevant. C and D are incorrect because the issue is not the actual validity of the claim, but whether the lender genuinely believed in its validity.","Formation of Contracts"
"A buyer contracted in writing with a shareholder, who owned all of XYZ Corporation's outstanding stock, to purchase all of her stock at a specified price per share. At the time this contract was executed, the buyer's contracting officer said to the shareholder, ""Of course, our commitment to buy is conditioned on our obtaining approval of the contract from our parent company."" The shareholder replied, ""Fine. No problem.""

The shareholder is willing and ready to consummate the sale of her stock to the buyer, but the latter refuses to perform on the ground (which is true) that the parent company has firmly refused to approve the contract.

If the shareholder sues the buyer for breach of contract and seeks to exclude any evidence of the oral condition requiring the parent company's approval, the court will probably",multiple-choice,"admit the evidence as proof of a collateral agreement.","admit the evidence as proof of a condition to the existence of an enforceable obligation, and therefore not within the scope of the parol evidence rule.","exclude the evidence on the basis of a finding that the parties' written agreement was a complete integration of their contract.","exclude the evidence as contradicting the terms of the parties' written agreement, whether or not the writing was a complete integration of the contract.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to prove that the written agreement is to take effect only upon the occurrence of a stated condition (even if the condition is for only one party's benefit). Because the buyer-shareholder agreement will only take effect upon approval by the parent company, extrinsic evidence of this oral understanding is admissible notwithstanding the parol evidence rule.

A is incorrect because the condition appears to be an integral part of the contract of sale. C and D are incorrect because the exception to the parol evidence rule for conditions precedent applies regardless of whether the final writing is partially or completely integrated and regardless of whether the extrinsic evidence may contradict the final writing (although these facts fail to suggest any such contradiction).","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A broker needed a certain rare coin to complete a set that he had contracted to assemble and sell to a collector. On February 1, the broker obtained such a coin from a hoarder in exchange for $1,000 and the broker's signed, written promise to re-deliver to the hoarder ""not later than December 31 this year"" a comparable specimen of the same kind of coin without charge to the hoarder. On February 2, the broker consummated sale of the complete set to the collector.

On October 1, the market price of rare coins suddenly began a rapid, sustained rise; and on October 15 the hoarder wrote the broker for assurance that the latter would timely meet his coin-replacement commitment. The broker replied, ""In view of the surprising market, it seems unfair that I should have to replace your coin within the next few weeks.""

Having received the broker's message on October 17, the hoarder sued the broker on November 15 for the market value of a comparable replacement-coin as promised by the broker in February. The trial began on December 1.

If the broker moves to dismiss the hoarder's complaint, which of the following is the broker's best argument in support of the motion?",multiple-choice,"The broker did not repudiate the contract on October 17, and may still perform no later than the contract deadline of December 31.","Even if the broker repudiated on October 17, the hoarder's only action would be for specific performance because the coin is a unique chattel.","Under the doctrine of impossibility, which includes unusually burdensome and unforseen impracticability, the broker is temporarily excused by the market conditions from timely performance of his coin-replacement obligation.","Even if the broker repudiated on October 17, the hoarder has no remedy without first demanding in writing that the broker retract his repudiation.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Under the UCC, where reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the other party's performance, a party may make a written demand for adequate assurance of due performance. Failure to provide such assurance within a reasonable time may be treated as repudiation of the contract. Although the hoarder made a request for assurances of performance which the broker failed to provide, the facts suggest that the hoarder's request for assurances was unreasonable. In order for a demand for assurances to be justified, the insecurity must relate either to the inability or unwillingness of the other party to perform. A mere shift in market price for rare coins does not impugn the broker's willingness or ability to perform the contract. Nor does the broker's October 17 reply manifest a repudiation of the contract. In order to amount to a repudiation, the communication must be an unequivocal statement of a party's inability or unwillingness to perform.

B is incorrect because the fact that the coin has a market price suggests that it is not sufficiently unique to award specific performance. C is incorrect because ordinarily a shift in market price is not a sufficient basis for a party to be excused from his contractual obligation on grounds of impracticability. D is incorrect because a repudiation, although retractable, entitles the non-repudiating party to pursue a remedy for total breach of contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"Which of the following fact patterns most clearly suggests an implied-in-fact contract?",multiple-choice,"A county tax assessor mistakenly bills a man for taxes on his neighbor's property, which the man, in good faith, pays.","A physician treated a rider without the rider's knowledge or consent, while the rider was unconscious as the result of a fall from his horse.","A contractor, thinking that he was paving the customer's driveway for which the contractor had an express contract, mistakenly paved the neighbor's driveway while the neighbor looked on without saying anything or raising any objection.","At her mother's request, an accountant filled out and filed her mother's ""E-Z"" income-tax form (a simple, short form).",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Although based on tacit, and not express, promises, implied-in-fact contracts are enforceable. An implied-in-fact contract may be inferred from parties' conduct, such as where services are rendered by one person for another under circumstances where it may fairly be presumed that the parties understood that compensation would be paid. The contractor paving the neighbor's driveway while the neighbor looks on without raising objection gives rise to the presumption on an implied-in-fact contract theory that the neighbor will pay the contractor for the work.

A is incorrect because it involved the mistaken payment of taxes which cannot reasonably be implied to create an implied obligation on the government's part. B is incorrect because the rider was unconscious when the physician helped him and therefore could not request his services (although physician might recover under restitution theory). D is incorrect because the law presumes that benefits conferred between family members are done gratuitously, without the expectation of payment.","Formation of Contracts"
"The inventor of the LBVC, a laser-beam vegetable chopper, ran a television ad that described the chopper and said, ""The LBVC is yours for only $49.99 if you send your check or money order to Box 007, Greenville. Not available in stores."" The owner of a retail specialty shop, wrote the inventor, ""What's your best, firm price for two dozen LBVCs."" The inventor sent a written reply that said in its entirety, ""We quote you for prompt acceptance $39.99 per unit for 24 LBVCs."" The owner of the retail specialty shop subsequently mailed a check to the inventor in the appropriate amount, with a memo enclosed saying, ""I accept your offer for 24 LBVCs.""

A contract would arise from these communications only if",multiple-choice,"both parties were merchants.","the inventor had at least 24 LBVCs in stock when the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo were received.","the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo were mailed within three months after his receipt of the inventor's letter.","the owner of the retail specialty shop's check and memo were mailed within a reasonable time after his receipt of the inventor's letters.",,,1,"Answer D is correct. The inventor's letter to the owner of the retail specialty shop, when taken in conjunction with the surrounding circumstances - the television advertisement - constituted an offer to the owner, which the owner could accept by complying with the television advertisement's method of acceptance. Since no duration was stated in either the advertisement or the letter to the owner, the offer would lapse after a reasonable time under the circumstances.

Choice A is incorrect because merchant status does not govern all transactions involving the sale of goods and is not necessary under the UCC for the owner to accept an offer for the sale of goods. Merchant status is only relevant in limited instances under the UCC, such as firm offers and the Statute of Frauds. Choice B is incorrect because the inventor's letter to the owner offered to provide 24 LBVCs. Choice C is incorrect because a reasonable period governs an offeree's power of acceptance. The three-month limitation for firm offers under the UCC does not apply because the offer gave no assurance that it would be held open and in fact used language indicating the contrary - ""for prompt acceptance.""","Formation of Contracts"
"On May 1 a lot owner telegraphed a buyer, ""Will sell you any or all of the lots in Grover subdivision at $5,000 each. Details will follow in letter."" The letter contained all the necessary details concerning terms of payment, insurance, mortgages, etc., and provided, ""This offer remains open until June 1.""

On May 2, after he had received the telegram but before he had received the letter, the buyer telegraphed the owner, ""Accept your offer with respect to lot 101."" Both parties knew that there were fifty lots in the Grover subdivision and that they were numbered 101 through 150.

Assume that the owner and the buyer were bound by a contract for the sale of lot 101 for $5,000, that on May 3 the owner telephoned the buyer to explain that because he had just discovered that a shopping center was going to be erected adjacent to the Grove subdivision, he would ""have to have $6,000 for each of the lots including lot 101,"" that the buyer thereupon agreed to pay him $6,000 for lot 101, and that on May 6 the buyer telegraphed, ""Accept your offer with respect to the rest of the lots."" Assuming that two contracts were formed and that there is no controlling statute, the buyer will most likely be required to pay",multiple-choice,"only $5,000 for each of the fifty lots.","only $5,000 for lot 101, but $6,000 for the remaining forty-nine lots.","$6,000 for each of the fifty lots.","$6,000 for lot 101, but only $5,000 for the remaining forty-nine lots.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. A valid contract existed for the sale of lot 101 for $5,000; the owner did not supply consideration for the modification, the modification was coercive to the buyer and not fair and equitable, and the owner could have anticipated that a shopping center was going to be built on adjacent property. The $6,000 price for the remaining forty-nine lots will be enforced because there was no agreement as to these lots, and the owner's statement on May 3 amounted to a revocation of his original offer as to the remaining lots and a new offer.

A is incorrect because the offer as to lots 102 through 150 was revocable prior to acceptance by the buyer. C is incorrect, because the contract for lot 101 was not effectively modified. D is incorrect because, although the owner could demand a higher price when his offer had not yet been accepted as to the remaining lots, his attempted modification as to the contract for lot 101 was ineffective.","Formation of Contracts"
"During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city. In early 2007 the city's City Council adopted this resolution:

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here.
The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 ""for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire."" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward.

In which of the following ways could the city reward offer be effectively accepted?",multiple-choice,"Only by an offeree's return promise to make a reasonable effort to bring about the arrest and conviction of an arsonist within the scope of the offer.","Only by an offeree's making the arrest and assisting in the successful conviction of an arsonist within the scope of the offer.","By an offeree's supplying information leading to arrest and conviction of an arsonist within the scope of the offer.","By an offeree's communication of assent through the same medium (television) used by the city in making its offer.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The resolution is an offer of a reward made to the general public. A reasonable interpretation of its words and the circumstances surrounding its broadcast on television indicate that it is inviting anyone to provide the information necessary to arrest and convict. Therefore, an acceptance of this offer made by the city would be any information given that would lead to an arrest of the arsonist.

A is incorrect because the language of the reward and the nature of a reward indicate that performance is invited and not promissory acceptance. B is incorrect because it is not reasonable to interpret the words of the reward as requiring actual arrest and participation in the prosecution of an individual when the offer of reward receives such widespread broadcast to the general public. D is incorrect because in order for an offer to require a particular mode of acceptance, it must be clearly stated in the offer. If the offer is silent as to mode of acceptance, a test of reasonableness applies. It would not be reasonable to require such an unorthodox and unavailable mode of acceptance. In this case, a reasonable interpretation of the offer is to require performance, not a promissory acceptance.","Formation of Contracts"
"On November 1, the following notice was posted in a privately-operated law school:

The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before May 1.
A student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, ""I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer."" This note was inadvertently placed in the student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore:

The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn.
The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything.

The promise of the faculty on November 1 was",multiple-choice,"enforceable on principles of promissory estoppel.","enforceable because the student accepted the faculty's offer.","not enforceable on policy grounds because it produced a noncommercial agreement between a student and his teachers, analogous to intramural family agreement and informal social commitments.","not enforceable, because the student, after entering the National Competition in October, was already under a duty to perform to the best of his ability.",,,2,"B is correct. An offer seeking only a performance and not a return promise is an offer for a unilateral contract. Such an offer is accepted once the requested performance has been completed and notice of acceptance has been given to the offeror. Once the offeree under a unilateral contract begins the invited performance, the offeror may not revoke the promise; however, the offeror's obligation is conditioned upon the offeree completing performance in accordance with the offer's terms. Therefore, because the requested performance (completion of the winning research paper) was completed and because the faculty's attempt to revoke the offer on April 1 was ineffective the promise is enforceable.

A is incorrect because, although promissory estoppel may operate to enforce a promise made prior to the conclusion of a contract, the better argument is that the student was successful in accepting the faculty's offer. C is incorrect because the mere fact that a contract was concluded in a family or informal social setting does not render it unenforceable on policy grounds. D is incorrect because the preexisting duty rule does not apply where the duty is owed to a third party; therefore the student gave sufficient consideration to support the promise.","Formation of Contracts"
"On January 15, in a signed writing, an artist agreed to remodel a building owner's building according to certain specifications, and the owner to pay the agreed price of $5,000 to the artist's niece as a birthday present. The niece did not learn of the agreement until her birthday on May 5.

Before they signed the writing, the artist and the owner had orally agreed that their ""written agreement will be null and void unless the owner is able to obtain a $5,000 loan from the bank before January 31.""

The owner was unable to obtain the loan, and, on January 31, phoned the artist and told him, ""Don't begin the work. The deal is off."" In an action for breach of contract brought against the owner by the proper party, will the owner be successful in asserting as a defense his inability to obtain a loan?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because obtaining a loan was a condition precedent to the existence of an enforceable contract.","Yes, because the agreement about obtaining a loan is a modification of a construction contract and is not required to be in writing.","No, because the agreement about obtaining a loan contradicts the express and implied terms of the writing.","No, because the owner is estopped to deny the validity of the written agreement.",,,1,"A is correct. The parol evidence rule allows extrinsic evidence to resolve an ambiguity, clarify a term of a contract or add to the written terms of a contract. Here, although the agreement is oral, it can be admitted to clarify the written agreement using parol evidence. The language of this oral agreement is an express condition precedent to enforcement and express conditions are strictly construed.

B is incorrect. Because the oral agreement was made before the written agreement was signed, it was not a modification. As stated above, the oral agreement is an express condition precedent to enforcement. Therefore, this answer choice is incorrect.

C is incorrect. The written agreement is silent as to the effect of not obtaining the loan or the date upon which performance was to begin. There is also nothing implied into the agreement that would contradict the oral condition.

D is incorrect. The artist had not begun performance prior to the January 31 notice that the loan had not been obtained, and there are no other facts to support detrimental reliance upon the written agreement by the artist. Thus, there is no estoppel.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A tenant rented a commercial building from a landlord, and operated a business in it. The building's large front window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the tenant-landlord lease. The tenant, who was obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases, promptly contracted with a window company to replace the window for $2,000, due 30 days after satisfactory completion of work. The landlord was then unaware of the tenant-window company contract. The window company was aware that the building was under lease, but dealt entirely with the tenant.

Sixty days after the window company's satisfactory completion of the window replacement, and prior to the expiration of the tenant's lease, the tenant, then insolvent, ceased doing business and vacated the building. In so doing, the tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2,000 security deposit with the landlord. The deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear. The only such damage occurring during the tenant's occupancy was the smashed window. The window company's $2,000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid.

Assuming that the window company has no remedy quasi in rem under the relevant state mechanic's lien statute, which of the following would provide the window company's best chance of an effective remedy in personam against the landlord?",multiple-choice,"An action in quasi contract for the reasonable value of a benefit unofficiously and non-gratuitously conferred on the landlord.","An action based on promissory estoppel.","An action based on an implied-in-fact contract.","An action as third-party intended beneficiary of the tenant-landlord lease.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Generally, a party that has made a contract with another cannot later disregard the contract and bring suit in restitution against a third person, even if that third person has received a benefit from the contract. For example, where the window company has conferred a benefit (replaced the glass in the window) pursuant to its contract with the tenant, it normally would not be able to recover in restitution from the landlord. However, sometimes recovery in restitution is possible, especially where the third person (the landlord) has not already paid someone else for the work and the claimant's (the window company's) avenues to bring suit to enforce the contract have been exhausted. These and other factors suggest that restitution against the landlord would be just in this case: the tenant is insolvent, the landlord collected on a $2,000 deposit that the tenant forfeited because of the broken window, and the fact that the lease expressly contemplated the tenant fixing any damage to the property suggests that the landlord would have requested the work if given the opportunity.

B is incorrect because the landlord made no promise on which the window company relied. C is incorrect because the landlord had no knowledge of the window company-tenant contract and therefore could not have implicitly promised to do anything. D is incorrect because on these facts, the window company would be, if anything, an incidental beneficiary of the landlord-tenant contract.",Remedies
"On July 18, a shovel manufacturer received an order for the purchase of 500 snow shovels from a wholesaler. The wholesaler had mailed the purchase order on July 15. The order required shipment of the shovels no earlier than September 15 and no later than October 15. Typed conspicuously across the front of the order form was the following: ""[the wholesaler] reserves the right to cancel this order at any time before September 1."" The manufacturer's mailed response, saying ""We accept your order,"" was received by the wholesaler on July 21.

The wholesaler did not cancel the order, and the manufacturer shipped the shovels to the wholesaler on September 15. When the shovels, conforming to the order in all respects, arrived on October 10, the wholesaler refused to accept them.

Which of the following is an accurate statement as of October 10 after the wholesaler rejected the shovels?",multiple-choice,"The wholesaler's order for the shovels, even if initially illusory, became a binding promise to accept and pay for them.","The wholesaler's order was an offer that became an option after shipment by the manufacturer.","The wholesaler's right to cancel was a condition subsequent, the failure of which resulted in an enforceable contract.","In view of the wholesaler's right to cancel its order prior to September 1, the shipment of the shovels on September 15 was only an offer by the manufacturer.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. An illusory promise may become consideration if the time during which the promisor could choose alternative performances has passed. Although reserving the right to terminate a contract for a specified period makes a promise illusory, the promise becomes consideration once the period for exercising the right to terminate has passed. Therefore, because the wholesaler did not exercise its right to cancel the order, the manufacturer became bound to the contract as of September 1.

B and D are incorrect because both parties became bound to a contract as of September 1. C is incorrect because no language that indicates the existence of condition subsequent, and even if there were such language, the failure of a condition subsequent would not create an enforceable contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"A painter, who has been in the painting business for ten years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint the farmer's barn. The farmer's barn is a standard red barn with a loft. The contract has no provision regarding assignment.

If the painter assigns the contract to a contractor and thereafter the contractor does not meet the contract specifications in painting the farmer's barn, the farmer",multiple-choice,"has a cause of action against the painter for damages.","has a cause of action only against the contractor for damages.","has a cause of action against the painter for damages only after he has first exhausted his remedies against the contractor.","does not have a cause of action against the painter for damages, because he waived his rights against the painter by permitting the contractor to perform the work.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Unless the other party to the contract (the farmer) agrees otherwise (e.g., by executing a novation substituting the new obligor and releasing the original obligor of its duty), delegation of a contractual duty does not discharge the obligation of the delegating obligor (the painter). Therefore, where the duty to paint the farmer's barn has been delegated and the delegatee (the contractor) breaches the duty by failing to meet contract specifications, the farmer may enforce the contract against the original obligor (the painter).

B and D are incorrect because, although the farmer may also enforce the obligation against the contractor (since the farmer is the intended beneficiary of the agreement that delegated the duty), delegation does not discharge the painter of his obligation to the farmer. C is incorrect because the farmer has a right to enforce the obligation against either party.","Third-Party Rights"
"On January 1, a builder and a landlowner agreed in writing that the builder would build a house on the landowner's lot according to the landowner's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on April 1. The landowner agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work.

On February 1, the builder notified the landowner that he (the builder) would lose money on the job at that price and would not proceed with the work unless the landowner would agree to increase the price to $90,000. The landowner thereupon, without notifying the builder, agreed in writing with a third-party for the third-party, commencing April 1, to build the house for $75,000, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done.

On April 1, both the builder and the third-party showed up at the building site to begin work, the builder telling the landowner that he had decided to ""take the loss"" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally agreed. The landowner dismissed the builder and allowed the third-party to begin work on the house.

In a contract action by the builder against the landowner, which of the following would the court decide under the prevailing American view?",multiple-choice,"The landowner will win, because the builder in legal effect committed a total breach of contract.","The landowner will win, because the third-party's contract price was $15,000 lower than the $90,000 demanded by the builder on February 1.","The builder will win, because the landowner did not tell him before April 1 about the contract with the third-party","The builder will win, because he attempted to perform the contract as originally agreed.",,,1,"A is correct. When the builder contacted the landowner on February 1 stating that he would not perform unless the landowner paid the builder more money for the same work, the builder was in total breach of the contract because his statement to the landlord made it clear that he was going to breach when performance became due. This statement was an anticipatory repudiation of the agreement.

B is incorrect. The landowner's agreement with the third-party is not evidence as to the builder's liability under the first agreement. This second agreement with the third-party instead satisfies the landowner's duty to mitigate damages via a substitute transaction. C is incorrect. The builder was in total breach of the agreement on February 1, and the landowner's duties under the contract were discharged. D is incorrect. His attempt at performance was subsequent to a discharge of the landowner's duties under the contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A dry goods retailer telephoned a towel manufacturer and offered to buy for $5 each a minimum of 500 and a maximum of 1,000 large bath towels, to be delivered in 30 days. The manufacturer orally accepted this offer and promptly sent the following letter to the retailer, which the retailer received two days later: ""This confirms our agreement today by telephone to sell you 500 large bath towels for 30-day delivery. /s/ Manufacturer."" Twenty-eight days later, the manufacturer tendered to the retailer 1,000 (not 500) conforming bath towels, all of which the retailer rejected because it had found a better price term from another supplier. Because of a glut in the towel market, the manufacturer cannot resell the towels except at a loss.

In a suit by the manufacturer against the retailer, which of the following will be the probable decision?",multiple-choice,"The manufacturer can enforce a contract for 1,000 towels, because the retailer ordered and the manufacturer tendered that quantity.","The manufacturer can enforce a contract for 500 towels, because the manufacturer's letter of confirmation stated that quantity term.","There is no enforceable agreement, because the retailer never signed a writing.","There is no enforceable agreement, because the manufacturer's letter of confirmation did not state a price term.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the UCC's Statute of Frauds, a contract for the sale of goods for $500 or more is not enforceable unless there is a writing sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made, which is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. The writing need not contain all of the terms of the contract, but it is only enforceable to the extent of the quantity term stated in the writing. The contract between the manufacturer and the retailer falls within the UCC Statute of Frauds because it is for over $500. However, when dealing with two merchants, there is something called the Confirmatory Memo Rule. In contracts between merchants, if one party, within a reasonable time after an oral understanding has been reached, sends a written confirmation to the other party that binds the sender, it will satisfy the Statute of Frauds requirements against the recipient as well, if the recipient knew of the memo's contents and failed to object to the memo's contents in writing within 10 days of when the confirmatory memo was received.

A is incorrect because the contract is only enforceable to the extent of the quantity term stated in the confirmation. C is incorrect because the writing only needs to be signed by one party when dealing with merchants. D is incorrect because the UCC Statute of Frauds does not require that the price term be stated in the writing.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A flour wholesaler contracted to deliver to a producer of fine baked goods her flour requirements for a one-year period. Before delivery of the first scheduled installment, the flour wholesaler sold its business and ""assigned"" all of its sale contracts to a miller, another reputable and long-time flour wholesaler. The original flour wholesaler informed the baked goods producer of this transaction.

Assume that when the miller tendered the first installment to the baked goods producer in compliance with the flour wholesaler-baked goods contract, the baked goods producer refused to accept the goods.

Can the baked goods producer legally reject the goods?",multiple-choice,"Yes; executory requirements contracts are nonassignable.","Yes; duties under an executory bilateral contract are assumable only by an express promise to perform on the part of the delegatee.","Yes; language of ""assignment"" in the transfer for value of a bilateral sale-of-goods contract effects only a transfer of rights, not a delegation of duties.","No; requirements contracts are assignable as long as the assignee does not disproportionately alter the contemplated quantity.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Generally, all contractual rights may be assigned. At common law, requirements and output contracts were not assignable. Under Article 2 of the UCC, however, requirements and output contracts are assignable as long as the assignee does not disproportionately alter the contemplated quantity. Here, this contract is governed by Article 2, as it is for the sale of goods. The miller tendered the first installment in compliance with the original contract between the flour wholesaler and the baked goods producer. Therefore, the baked goods producer must accept the goods.

Answer A is incorrect. A party may perform his duty through a delegatee unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform the contract. Although assignment of a requirements contract may potentially affect the burden of the seller in certain cases (such as where the assignee has substantially different requirements than the assignor), courts will still uphold the assignment of such contracts because the UCC rules on requirements contracts impose reasonably objective standards of good faith in specifying requirements. In any event, the assignment to the miller, will not have such an effect, because the party assigning its contract is the seller. Because the miller is comparable to the flour wholesaler in terms of reputation and experience, the baked goods producer should not have a particular interest in having the flour wholesaler perform the contract. B is incorrect because performance by the delegatee is sufficient. C is incorrect because under the UCC, general language of assignment of a contract will be construed as a delegation of performance as well as an assignment of rights.","Third-Party Rights"

The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before May 1.
A student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, ""I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer."" This note was inadvertently placed in the student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore:

The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn.
The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything.

An offer for a unilateral contract is one that seeks only performance and does not seek a return promise as the means of acceptance. Under the modern view, most contracts are considered bilateral, with two exceptions. A traditional unilateral contract occurs where: (1) the offeror clearly indicates that completion of performance is the only manner of acceptance, or (2) the offer is made to the public, such as a reward or contest offer. Here, the offer to the law student population constitutes an offer to the public, and is the type of offer which clearly contemplates acceptance by performance. It would be unreasonable to consider a promise a valid acceptance in the context of a contest. B, C, and D are incorrect because each suggests that an offer to the public could reasonably be construed as an offer for a bilateral contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"A photographer and a customer entered a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read as follows: ""[the photographer] to supply [the customer] with 200 personalized Christmas cards on or before December 15, bearing a photograph of [the customer] and his family, and [the customer] to pay $100 thirty days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by the photographer at [the customer]'s house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time."" Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by the photographer's not being notified promptly by the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, ""The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on time.""

Which of the following statements is most accurate?",multiple-choice,"Payment by the customer of the $100 was a condition precedent to the photographer's duty of performance.","The performances of the photographer and the customer under the contract were concurrently conditional.","Payment by the customer of the $100 was a condition subsequent to the photographer's duty of performance.","Performance by the photographer under the contract was a condition precedent to the customer's duty of payment of the $100.",,,4,"D is correct. The agreement expressly stated that the customer would have thirty days after the photographer completed performance to make payment. Additionally, the contract contained a conditional satisfaction clause rendering payment due only if the customer was satisfied with the photographer's performance.

A is incorrect. The contract required payment thirty days after the photographer completed performance. B is incorrect. The conditional satisfaction clause makes simultaneous performance impossible. C is incorrect. The customer's duty to pay is his performance under the contract; it does not terminate a duty that came into existence when the contract was formed.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"Responding to the county's written advertisement for bids, a tire salesman was the successful bidder for the sale of tires to the county for the county's vehicles. The tire salesman and the county entered into a signed, written agreement that specified, ""It is agreed that the tire salesman will deliver all tires required by this agreement to the county in accordance with the attached bid form and specifications, for a one-year period beginning September 1, 1990."" Attached to the agreement was a copy of the bid form and specifications. In the written advertisement to which the tire salesman had responded, but not in the bid form, the county had stated, ""Multiple awards may be issued if they are in the best interests of the county."" No definite quantity of tires to be bought by the county from the tire salesman was specified in any of these documents. 

In January 1991, the tire salesman learned that the county was buying some of its tires from one of the tire salesman's competitors. Contending that the tire salesman-county agreement was a requirements contract, the tire salesman sued the county for the damages caused by the county buying some of its tires from the competitor.

If the court concludes that the tire salesman-county contract is an agreement by the county to buy its tire requirements from the tire salesman, the tire salesman probably will",multiple-choice,"recover under the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution.","recover under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.","not recover, because the agreement lacks mutuality of obligation.","not recover, because the agreement is indefinite as to quantity.",,,2,"B is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for the sale of a good that measures the quantity by the requirements of the buyer for that good means such actual requirements that may occur in good faith. At a minimum, this means that the buyer must purchase all of its requirements for the good exclusively from the seller. If the court concludes that the tire salesman-county contract is a requirements contract, then the fact that the county is buying some of its tires from a competitor would mean that the county has breached the requirements contract, entitling the tire salesman to damages.

A is incorrect. The contracts clause is not at issue. C is incorrect. UCC rules regarding requirements contracts make clear that such agreements impose binding obligations on both the buyer and the seller. D is incorrect. Although the quantity term in a requirements contract is flexible, it is sufficiently definite for a court to enforce.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A developer obtained a bid of $10,000 to tear down her old building and another bid of $90,000 to replace it with a new structure in which she planned to operate a sporting goods store. Having only limited cash available, the developer asked the lender for a $100,000 loan. After reviewing the plans for the project, the lender in a signed writing promised to lend the developer $100,000 secured by a mortgage on the property and repayable over ten years in equal monthly installments at 10% annual interest. The developer promptly accepted the demolition bid and the old building was removed, but the lender thereafter refused to make the loan. Despite diligent efforts, the developer was unable to obtain a loan from any other source.

Assume that the developer has a cause of action against the lender.

If she sues him for monetary relief, what is the probable measure of her recovery?",multiple-choice,"Expectation damages, measured by the difference between the value of the new building and the old building, less the amount of the proposed loan ($100,000).","Expectation damages, measured by the estimated profits from operating the proposed sporting goods store for ten years, less the cost of repaying a $100,000 loan at 10% interest over ten years.","Reliance damages, measured by the $10,000 expense of removing the old building, adjusted by the decrease or increase in the market value of the developer's land immediately thereafter.","Nominal damages only, because both expectation and reliance damages are speculative, and there is no legal or equitable basis for awarding restitution.",,,3,"C is correct. Because there was no consideration for the lender's promise, any recovery would have to based on a promissory estoppel theory (due to the developer's detrimental reliance). Therefore, the remedy for breach of the promise may be limited as justice requires. A court may limit damages by awarding the injured party the amount necessary to remedy the loss incurred due to the reliance, rather than awarding plaintiff's expectation damages (i.e., damages equivalent to the value of full performance). When the lender breached its promise to make the loan, the developer was injured because she had already torn down the old building. The damages necessary to restore her to the status quo before the promise was made would include the cost of demolition, plus any loss that the developer incurred from the depreciation of the property resulting from the demolition.

A and B are incorrect. A court need not award full expectation damages in an action based on detrimental reliance. D is incorrect. The developer's reliance damages can be ascertained with reasonable certainty.",Remedies

The 100 bolts were shipped, and the buyer paid the seller. Upon inspection, however, the buyer discovered that the wool was No. 2 quality. The buyer thereupon tendered back the wool to the seller and demanded return of his payment.

"A buyer sent a seller an offer to buy 50 tons of cotton of a specified quality. The offer contained no terms except those specifying the amount and quality of the cotton. The seller then sent an acknowledgment by fax. The acknowledgment repeated the terms of the buyer's offer and stated that shipment would occur within five days. Among 12 printed terms on the acknowledgment was a statement that any dispute about the cotton's quality would be submitted to arbitration. Neither the buyer nor the seller said anything further about arbitration. The seller shipped the cotton, and it was accepted by the buyer. A dispute arose between the buyer and the seller as to the quality of the cotton, and the seller asserted that the dispute had to be submitted to arbitration. The buyer instead sued the seller in court.

In that suit, which of the following arguments best supports the seller's position that the buyer must submit the dispute to arbitration?",multiple-choice,"Arbitration is a more efficient method of resolving disputes than resolving them in court.","The provision for arbitration did not contradict any term in the buyer's offer.","The provision for arbitration did not materially alter the parties' contract.","The seller's acknowledgment containing a provision for arbitration constituted a counteroffer that was accepted by the buyer when it accepted delivery of the cotton.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Because the buyer's offer was silent as to arbitration, the arbitration provision in the seller's acknowledgment should be characterized as an additional term. Under UCC § 2-207(2), an additional term is considered a proposal for addition to the contract. Section 2-207(2) also provides that an additional term becomes a term of the parties' contract unless certain specified circumstances are present. One such circumstance is where an additional term materially alters the parties' contract. Because none of the other circumstances appear applicable here, the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties' contract. Thus, Answer C is correct. 

Answer A is incorrect. Even assuming that arbitration is a more efficient dispute resolution mechanism, arbitration's relative efficiency is not the governing standard for assessing whether the arbitration provision became a term of the parties' agreement.

Answer B is incorrect. The question as to whether the arbitration provision did or did not contradict an express term of the offer is not the appropriate standard for determining whether the provision became a term of the parties' contract. As stated above, the correct standard is whether the seller's acknowledgement should be characterized as an additional term.

Answer D is incorrect. Under the common law, an additional material term in a response to an offer constitutes a counteroffer. However, UCC Article 2 governs this transaction because it involves a sale of goods. Under UCC § 2-207, the presence of an additional term--the arbitration provision in the seller's acknowledgment--did not give rise to a counteroffer. Rather, a contract was formed, and the arbitration provision constituted a proposal for an addition to the contract. Moreover, under UCC § 2-207, a buyer's mere acceptance of goods does not constitute assent to an additional term contained in a seller's acceptance. However, under the standards set out in UCC § 2-207(2), the arbitration provision will be considered a term of the contract if the seller can successfully argue that the provision did not materially alter the parties' contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"A manufacturer of computers pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5 percent on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. The manufacturer's sales people are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission, the salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer.

In 2006, a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation for a $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with the corporation's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to develop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised the corporation, with the manufacturer's knowledge and approval, to assist the corporation for six months after installation in making the equipment work.

On January 1, 2007, the corporation signed an order, and on March 1, the computer was installed. On March 15, the manufacturer fired the salesperson on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 2005 and 2006 sales quotas. The salesperson thought that the manufacturer was correct in this statement. A coworker was thereupon assigned to service the large corporation's account. On March 31, manufacturer billed the corporation for the computer.

Assume that the manufacturer's termination of the salesperson's employment was not wrongful. If the salesperson, after demand and refusal, sues the manufacturer for the corporation sale commission, which of the following is the most likely to result?",multiple-choice,"The salesperson will win, because he had procured the sale of the computer.","The salesperson will win, because he had promised the corporation that he would assist in making the equipment work.","The manufacturer will win, because the coworker is entitled to the commission on a quantum meruit basis.","The manufacturer will win, because the salesperson was not employed as the manufacturer's salesperson when the company was billed for the computer.",,,4,"D is correct. An express contractual condition to recovery of the commission requires that a sales person be employed by the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer.

A is incorrect. Although the salesperson had procured the sale, his written employment agreement required that he also be employed by the manufacturer when the bill was sent to the customer.

B is incorrect. The salesperson's oral promise to a third party cannot modify an express condition in his contract with his employer.

C is incorrect. Although the coworker will be entitled to the sale commission, the express written contract with the manufacturer would be the basis of payment, not an equitable theory.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"

Although the ski-shop operator received and read the glove manufacturer's message within minutes after its dispatch, she changed her mind three weeks later about the purchase and rejected the conforming shipment when it timely arrived.

On learning of the rejection, does the glove manufacturer have a cause of action against the ski-shop operator for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the gloves were identified in the contract and tendered to the ski-shop operator.","Yes, because the glove manufacturer's faxed memo to the ski-shop operator was sufficient to make the agreement enforceable.","No, because the agreed price was $600 and the ski-shop operator never signed a writing evidencing a contract with the glove manufacturer.","No, because the ski-shop operator neither paid for nor accepted any of the goods tendered.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. Under the UCC, a contract for the sale of goods for $500 or more must be evidenced by a writing that is signed by the person against whom enforcement is sought. As an exception to the rule, a signed writing will not be required between merchants where a written confirmation of a contract of sale has been sent and the recipient fails to give notice of objection to the confirmation within ten days of its receipt. The contract between the ski-shop operator and the glove manufacturer falls within the UCC Statute of Frauds, since it is for $600. However, because the ski-shop operator and the glove manufacturer both appear to be merchants and because the ski-shop operator failed to object to the writing within ten days of its receipt, it appears that the glove manufacturer's faxed memo is a written confirmation that falls within the exception. A and D are incorrect because they are not relevant to the issue raised in the problem. C is incorrect because, although the contract falls within the UCC statute of frauds provision, an exception to the rule applies.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A developer contracted in writing to sell to a buyer a house on a one-acre lot for $100,000. The developer told the buyer that the lot abutted a national park and that the water for the house came from a natural artesian spring. The developer knew that both of these representations were important to the buyer and that both were false. The buyer moved into the house and eight months later learned that a private golf course was being constructed on the adjacent land and that the water for his house was piped in from the city reservoir. The buyer immediately sued the developer to avoid the contract. 

The construction of the golf course will probably increase the market value of the buyer's property, and the water from the city reservoir exceeds all established standards for drinking water. 

Is the buyer likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because eight months exceeds a reasonable time for contract avoidance.","No, because the developer's misstatements caused no economic harm to the buyer.","Yes, because the contract was void ab initio.","Yes, because the buyer retained the power to avoid the contract due to fraud.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A party may avoid a contract to which the party's assent was induced by fraud. The time period within which a party may avoid a contract due to misrepresentation does not begin to run until that party either knows or has reason to know of the misrepresentation. In this case, the buyer's eight-month delay will not preclude him from avoiding the contract because he did not learn of the misrepresentation until eight months after the parties entered into the contract; the buyer immediately sought to avoid the contract after learning of the misrepresentation. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answer A is incorrect.

Answer B is incorrect. A party may avoid a contract to which the party's assent was induced by fraud even if the resulting transaction is fair on its terms. Because the buyer immediately sought to avoid the contract after learning of the misrepresentation, he will likely prevail.

Answer C is incorrect. Void ab initio means void from the outset. An agreement to which assent is induced by a misrepresentation is not void. Rather, it is voidable, which permits the party whose assent was induced by the misrepresentation to avoid the agreement.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"In a single writing, Painter contracted with Farmer to paint three identical barns on her rural estate for $2,000 each. The contract provided for Farmer's payment of $6,000 upon Painter's completion of the work on all three barns. Painter did not ask for any payment when the first barn was completely painted, but she demanded $4,000 after painting the second barn.

Assume that Farmer rightfully refused Painter's demand for payment.

If Painter immediately terminates the contract without painting the third barn, what is Painter entitled to recover from Farmer?",multiple-choice,"Nothing, because payment was expressly conditioned on completion of all three barns.","Painter's expenditures plus anticipated ""profit"" in painting the first two barns, up to a maximum recovery of $4,000.","The reasonable value of Painter's services in painting the two barns, less Farmer's damages, if any, for Painter's failure to paint the third barn.","The amount that the combined value of the two painted barns has been increased by Painter's work.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A breaching party is entitled to recover in restitution for the reasonable value of the benefit conferred on the non-breaching party in the way of part performance, less any damages that the non-breaching party suffered due to the breach. Since Painter terminated the contract without justification, it is the breaching party. As a breaching plaintiff, Painter is entitled to recover damages equivalent to the reasonable value of its services in painting the two barns, minus any additional cost to Farmer (above what it would have paid under the contract) of having the third barn painted. A is incorrect because, even if Painter's right to payment was expressly conditioned upon completion, failure to satisfy the condition would not cut off Painter's right to recover in restitution. B is incorrect because a breaching party is not entitled to recover expectation damages (which would include lost profit). D is incorrect because it does not subtract from the restitution recovery any damages for the loss Farmer suffered due to the breach.",Remedies
"In March, when a teenager was 17, an electronics dealer delivered to the teenager a television set. At that time the teenager agreed in writing to pay $400 for the set on July 1 when he would reach his eighteenth birthday. Eighteen is the applicable statutory age of majority, and on that date the teenager was to receive the proceeds of a trust. On July 1, when the reasonable value of the television set was $250, the teenager sent the dealer a signed letter stating, ""I'll only pay you $300; that is all the set is worth.""

In an action against the teenager for money damages on July 2, what is the maximum amount that the dealer will be entitled to recover?",multiple-choice,Nothing.,"$250, the reasonable value of the set.","$300, the amount the teenager promised to pay in his letter of July 1.","$400, the original sale price.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Because the promises were exchanged when the teenager was a minor, he had voidable rights under the contract. His July 1 letter was written upon his eighteenth birthday, and because agreements cannot be partially disaffirmed, this letter amounted to a disaffirmance of the prior agreement. Thus, the only amount the dealer can receive is the amount now offered by the teenager.

A is incorrect because although the teenager was entitled to disaffirm the contract upon reaching majority, he was also entitled to ratify his earlier agreement, which he did by agreeing to pay a reduced amount. B is incorrect because the teenager had the right to disaffirm the contract and to obtain rescission by returning the consideration (the television set) and if he did this, he would not incur any additional obligation. He would not be obligated to pay its reasonable value. D is incorrect, because the teenager acquired only voidable duties under the original contract.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"A farmer leased in writing a 100-acre farm from a landowner for five years at $2,000 per year, with an option to purchase ""five acres of the land for $10,000 cash"" at the end of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the landowner orally promised to have a five-acre parcel surveyed before the end of the lease term. The farmer took possession of the farm and paid the rent for five years. During the fifth year, having decided that he would exercise the purchase option, the farmer planted several fruit trees and built a large grain silo on the property. At the end of the term, the farmer tendered the landowner $10,000 and demanded a conveyance, but the landowner repudiated the option agreement and retook possession of the farm. He had never had the five-acre parcel surveyed.

In an action by the farmer against the landowner for specific performance of the option agreement, which of the following is the landowner's best defense?",multiple-choice,"The option part of the agreement is unenforceable because it lacked a separate consideration.","The description of the property to be sold in the parties' written agreement is too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.","The landowner's failure to have the five-acre parcel surveyed was failure of a condition precedent to his own duty of performance.","The option part of the agreement is unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The subject matter of the option, five acres of a 100-acre farm, was not identified with reasonable specificity and as such was vague and unenforceable. A is incorrect because separate consideration is not necessary to support an option that is a term under an existing contract, such as the five-year lease agreement between the landowner and the farmer. The option is simply considered one of the rights purchased by the lessee under the lease and is also supported by the $2,000 yearly consideration paid by the farmer. C is incorrect. The landowner's oral promise to survey the land was a promise to perform an act, and this promise was not made a condition precedent to the farmer's duty to pay. D is also incorrect because the option was explicitly provided for in the writing and not a part of the oral promise by the landowner.","Formation of Contracts"
"On May 1, an uncle mailed a letter to his adult nephew that stated: ""I am thinking of selling my pickup truck, which you have seen and ridden in. I would consider taking $7,000 for it."" On May 3, the nephew mailed the following response: ""I will buy your pickup for $7,000 cash."" The uncle received this letter on May 5 and on May 6 mailed a note that stated: ""It's a deal."" On May 7, before the nephew had received the letter of May 6, he phoned his uncle to report that he no longer wanted to buy the pickup truck because his driver's license had been suspended.

Which of the following statements concerning this exchange is accurate?",multiple-choice,"There is a contract as of May 3.","There is a contract as of May 5.","There is a contract as of May 6.","There is no contract.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The uncle's original letter was not an offer. It was merely a statement indicating a possible interest in selling the truck, and a suggestion as to a price that might be acceptable. It would be regarded, if anything, as a statement soliciting an offer. The nephew's letter, mailed on May 3, constituted an offer to buy the pickup. The uncle's note, mailed on May 6, constituted an acceptance of the nephew's offer, and was effective when mailed. Therefore a contract arose on May 6.

Answer A is incorrect. There was no contract formed on May 3, because the uncle's original letter was not an offer. It was merely a statement indicating a possible interest in selling the truck and a suggestion as to a price that might be acceptable. It would be regarded, if anything, as a statement soliciting an offer. The nephew's letter, mailed on May 3, constituted an offer to buy the pickup truck. The uncle's note, mailed on May 6, constituted an acceptance of the nephew's offer, and was effective when mailed. And so a contract arose on May 6.

Answer B is incorrect. On May 5 the uncle received the offer from the nephew, but had not yet accepted it. As a result, there was no contract on May 5. The uncle's note, mailed on May 6, constituted an acceptance of the nephew's offer, and was effective when mailed. Therefore a contract arose on May 6.

Answer D is incorrect. The nephew's letter, mailed on May 3, constituted an offer to buy the pickup truck. The uncle's note, mailed on May 6, constituted an acceptance of the nephew's offer, and was effective when mailed. And so a contract arose on May 6. The law would treat the nephew's May 3 letter as an offer, even though the nephew might have mistakenly believed it to be an acceptance of an offer. The nephew's May 7 phone call was too late to constitute a revocation of his May 3 offer, since it had already been accepted. The nephew's license revocation would not constitute a defense to the existence of the contract for sale.","Formation of Contracts"
"Two salesmen, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen--one for a pharmaceutical company and the other for a widget manufacturer. The pharmaceutical salesman wrote the widget salesman by United States mail on Friday, October 8:

I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or before noon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand.

Sincerely,

[signed] the pharmaceutical salesman

The widget salesman replied by mail the following day:

I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified.

Sincerely,

[signed] the widget salesman

This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by the pharmaceutical salesman until November 10. The pharmaceutical salesman had bought another Sujocki bike from a different friend for $1,050 a few hours before.

The friend saw the widget salesman at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: ""I sold my Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman yesterday for $1,050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?"" The widget salesman replied: ""I'll let you know in a few days.""

On November 12, the widget salesman took his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman's residence; he arrived at 11:15 a.m. The pharmaceutical salesman was asleep and did not answer the ringing doorbell until 12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had already bought someone else's bike.

What is the probable legal effect of the friend's conversation with the widget salesman and report that he (the friend) had sold his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman on November 10?",multiple-choice,"This report had no legal effect because the pharmaceutical salesman's offer was irrevocable until November 12.","Unless a contract had already been formed between the widget salesman and the pharmaceutical salesman, the friend's report to the widget salesman operated to terminate the widget salesman's power of accepting the pharmaceutical salesman's offer.","This report has no legal effect because the offer had been made by a prospective buyer (the pharmaceutical salesman) rather than a prospective seller.","The friend's conversation with the widget salesman on November 11 terminated the pharmaceutical salesman's original offer and operated as an offer by the friend to buy the widget salesman's Sujocki for $950.",,,2,"B is the correct answer. The conversation between the friend and the widget salesman was a revocation by indirect communication. For a revocation by indirect communication to terminate the offer, the offeree must indirectly receive: (1) correct information, (2) from a reliable source, (3) of acts of the offeror that would indicate to a reasonable person that the offeror no longer wishes to make the offer. Here, the widget salesman hears a truthful statement from a friend of the offeror that the offeror had just purchased another motorcycle of the same type. In this situation, this information would indicate to a reasonable person that the offeror no longer wishes to make the offer. Therefore, so long as a contract has not already been formed, this conversation would be an adequate revocation of the offer.

A is incorrect because the offer was revocable as it was not a sale by a merchant under the UCC, nor was it a valid option contract as the option promise was not supported by consideration. C is incorrect because revocation can still be valid when received via indirect communication. D is not the best answer as it fails to recognize the possibility that the widget salesman could have already formed a contract by sending the letter, which would preclude the revocation by indirect communication.","Formation of Contracts"
"On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of programs for the department store's computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety:

The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store's Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing.

On June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. The parties orally agreed that the store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the store's computer systems manager. On July 5, the programming company completed the programs. Tests showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the store's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. The department store's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion, requested that the escrow agent return the $20,000, and asserted that nothing was owed to the programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.

The department store denies liability on the ground that the programming company had orally agreed to coordinate with the department store's methods of accounting, and the programming company seeks to bar introduction of that agreement based on the parol evidence rule. The department store's most effective argument is that",multiple-choice,"the parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence for the purpose of interpreting a written agreement.","the memorandum was not a completely integrated agreement.","the department store detrimentally relied on the oral promise of coordination in signing the memorandum.","the memorandum was not a partially integrated agreement.",,,2,"B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to interpret an ambiguity in the writing. The department store seeks to introduce in litigation extrinsic evidence of a prior oral agreement by the computer programming company to coordinate its computer program with the department store's methods of accounting. Since the written memo between the parties is silent with respect to this issue, the evidence should be admissible so long as the writing is found to be partially and not completely integrated. The fact that the writing is only two sentences long and does not contain a merger clause suggests that the memo was only partially integrated, and therefore the department store should be successful in introducing the evidence. 

A is incorrect. Although the stated exception to the rule is correct, the evidence is not offered to clear up an ambiguity in the writing but rather to supplement the writing as to a matter on which it is silent. C is incorrect. The department store's reliance, although relevant to the no-oral-modification clause, is not relevant to the admissibility of the evidence of the prior oral promise. D is incorrect. The memo appears to be a final, albeit not exclusive, expression of the parties' understanding.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A construction company contracted with a warehouse owner to construct for $500,000 a warehouse and an access driveway at highway level. Shortly after commencing work on the driveway, which required for the specified level some excavation and removal of surface material, the construction company unexpectedly encountered a large mass of solid rock.

Upon encountering the rock formation, the construction company, instead of incurring additional costs to remove it, built the access driveway over the rock with a steep grade down to the highway. The warehouse owner, who was out of town for several days, was unaware of this nonconformity until the driveway had been finished. As built, it is too steep to be used safely by trucks or cars, particularly in the wet or icy weather frequently occurring in the area. It would cost $30,000 to tear out and rebuild the driveway at highway level. As built, the warehouse, including the driveway, has a fair market value of $550,000. The warehouse owner has paid $470,000 to the construction company, but refuses to pay more because of the nonconforming driveway, which the construction company has refused to tear out and rebuild.

If the construction company sues the warehouse owner for monetary relief, what is the maximum amount that the construction company is entitled to recover?",multiple-choice,"$30,000, because the fair market value of the warehouse and driveway ""as is"" exceeds the contract price by $50,000 (more than the cost of correcting the driveway).","$30,000, because the construction company substantially performed and the cost of correcting the driveway would involve economic waste.","$30,000, minus whatever amount the construction company saved by not building the driveway at the specified level.","Nothing, because the warehouse owner is entitled to damages for the cost of correcting the driveway.",,,4,"D is correct. The general damages rule for measuring loss to an owner for breach of a construction contract is that owner is entitled to damages in an amount equivalent to the cost to complete the work as promised. An exception to the rule is where the cost to complete damages would be grossly and unfairly out of proportion to the performance contracted for, in which case damages will be limited to the diminution in market value of the construction due to the defect. Although the fair market value of the warehouse and the defective driveway exceeds the contract price, the warehouse owner nonetheless is entitled to the cost to complete damages, because these damages fairly reflect his loss resulting from the defective construction. The warehouse owner, therefore, was justified in withholding $30,000 from the contract price paid to the construction company.

A and C are incorrect. The warehouse owner is entitled to deduct the $30,000 cost to complete damages from the contract price, as explained above. B is incorrect. The warehouse owner can recover damages for breach regardless of whether the construction company substantially performed the contract.",Remedies
"On January 1, a builder and a landowner agreed in writing that the builder would build a house on the landowner's lot according to the landowner's plans and specifications for $60,000, the work to commence on April 1. The landowner agreed to make an initial payment of $10,000 on April 1, and to pay the balance upon completion of the work.

On February 1, the builder notified the landowner that he (the builder) would lose money on the job at that price, and would not proceed with the work unless the landowner would agree to increase the price to $90,000. The landowner thereupon, without notifying the builder, agreed in writing with a third-party for the third-party, commencing April 1, to build the house for $75,000, which was the fair market cost of the work to be done.

On April 1, both the builder and the third-party showed up at the building site to begin work, the builder telling the landowner that he had decided to ""take the loss"" and would build the house for $60,000 as originally agreed. The landowner dismissed the builder and allowed the third-party to begin work on the house.

The third-party finished the house on schedule and then showed the landowner that he (the third-party) had spent $85,000 on the job. The landowner thereupon paid the third-party the full balance of their contract price plus an additional $10,000, so that the third-party would not lose money.

He is not entitled to an additional amount representing the $10,000 extra that he paid the third-party because he was not contractually obligated to pay that amount to the third-party. It would, therefore, not be a part of the actual loss he avoided by the substitute transaction. For this reason C is incorrect.

A is incorrect. This would not represent the landowner's expectation interest under his contract with the builder. B is incorrect.

"A seller entered into a contract to sell to a buyer a house for a price of $150,000. The contract contained the following clause: ""This contract is conditional on the buyer's securing bank financing at an interest rate of 7% or below."" The buyer did not make an application for bank financing and therefore did not secure it, and refused to proceed with the purchase. The seller sued the buyer for breach of contract. 

Is the seller likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because the buyer did not secure bank financing.","No, because the contract did not expressly impose on the buyer any obligation to apply for bank financing.","Yes, because a court will excuse the condition to avoid a disproportionate forfeiture.","Yes, because a court will imply a term imposing on the buyer a duty to use reasonable efforts to secure bank financing.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the condition occurs or its nonoccurrence is excused. According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, the duty of good faith is implied inasmuch as ""every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement."" The duty of good faith imposed an obligation on the buyer to make reasonable efforts to secure bank financing. Accordingly, the failure of the condition (in this case, the bank financing commitment) to occur did not discharge the buyer's performance obligation. Thus, Answer D is correct.

Answer A is incorrect because, as stated above, the buyer had a good faith duty to try and secure bank financing. The buyer breached this duty by failing to apply for financing.

Answer B is incorrect because, as stated above, the duty of good faith imposed an obligation on the buyer to make reasonable efforts to secure the described bank financing.

Answer C is incorrect. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the condition occurs or its nonoccurrence is excused. The nonoccurrence of a condition may be excused in order to avoid disproportionate forfeiture. The excuse is inapplicable here because there was no forfeiture, which is defined by the comments to § 229 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts as ""the denial of compensation that results when the obligee loses his right to the agreed exchange after he has relied substantially, as by preparation or performance, on the expectation of that exchange.""","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"In a single writing, a painter contracted with a farmer to paint three identical barns on her rural estate for $2,000 each.

The painter did not ask for any payment when the first barn was completely painted, but she demanded $4,000 after painting the second barn.

Is the farmer obligated to make the $4,000 payment?",multiple-choice,"No, because the farmer has no duty under the contract to pay anything to the painter until all three barns have been painted.","No, because the painter waived her right, if any, to payment on a per-barn basis by failing to demand $2,000 upon completion of the first barn.","Yes, because the contract is divisible.","Yes, because the painter has substantially performed the entire contract.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's contractual obligation is conditioned upon the other party's substantial performance. However, where one party's performance requires a period of time (such as the painter's obligation to paint the barns), that performance is due before the other party is obligated to perform, unless the contract specifies otherwise. In this case, the farmer-painter contract not only failed to provide for progress payments, but it expressly provided for payment only ""upon the painter's completion of the work on all three barns."" Thus the farmer was not obligated to pay any portion of the contract price until the painter had substantially completed painting the three barns.

B is incorrect because the painter had no right to payment after completing the first barn. C is incorrect because the contract could only be treated as divisible in the event that the farmer breached the contract. D is incorrect because painting two of the three barns does not appear to be substantial performance (and even if it were, the express terms of the contract may be construed as expressly conditioning the painter's right to payment upon completing all three barns).","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A car dealer owed a bank $10,000, due on June 1. The car dealer subsequently sold an automobile to a buyer at a price of $10,000, payable at $1,000 per month beginning on June 1. The car dealer then asked the bank whether the bank would accept payments of $1,000 per month for 10 months beginning June 1, without interest, in payment of the debt. The bank agreed to that arrangement and the car dealer then directed the buyer to make the payments to the bank. When the buyer tendered the first payment to the bank, the bank refused the payment, asserting that it would accept payment only from the car dealer. On June 2, the bank demanded that the car dealer pay the debt in full immediately. The car dealer refused to pay and the bank sued the car dealer to recover the $10,000.

In this suit, which of the following arguments best supports the bank's claim for immediate payment?",multiple-choice,"The agreement to extend the time for payment was not in writing.","The dealer could not delegate its duty to pay to the buyer.","The dealer gave no consideration for the agreement to extend the time of payment.","The dealer's conduct was an attempted novation that the bank could reject.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The bank had a right to insist on payment of the note, and promised to allow the car dealer to pay the debt in installments. There was no consideration for the bank's promise. There would have been consideration if the dealer had assigned its right to receive payment from the retail buyer; the benefit to the bank would have been the addition of another obligor from whom it could expect payment. There was no assignment here, but rather an instruction to the retail buyer to redirect his payments. Accordingly, the bank may reinstate the due date despite its earlier waiver; it is not bound by the installment agreement and may demand full payment at once.

Answer A is incorrect. There is no requirement that a promise, like that made by the bank, be in writing. The parties could have made an enforceable oral agreement to reschedule the payments—-so long as there was consideration for promises made by the parties. Because there was no consideration given by the dealer, the bank is not bound by its earlier waiver of the due date and may demand full payment at once.

Answer B is incorrect. The dealer hasn't attempted to delegate its duty to pay under the contract. Instead, the dealer has simply asked the buyer to make payments directly to the bank rather than to the dealer. The better argument is that the bank may reinstate the due date despite its earlier waiver because there was no consideration given by the dealer; thus, the bank is not bound by the installment agreement and may demand full payment at once.

Answer D is incorrect. The transaction in this instance cannot properly be characterized as a novation. A novation is a three-party agreement in which one party is substituted for another, the other being released from an obligation. So, for example, A owes B. In a novation situation, A, B, and C all agree that C will undertake an obligation to B, and B agrees that A will be released from any duties to B under the original agreement. There was no attempted novation here. The bank may reinstate the due date despite its earlier waiver because there was no consideration given by the dealer; thus, the bank is not bound by the installment agreement and may demand full payment at once.","Formation of Contracts"

The dealer knew these representations of fact to be false, but still made them with the intent to induce the buyer to enter into the contract even though they would cause injury to the buyer. Finally, the false statements were made by someone with superior knowledge about the car and related to its value and ascertainable facts about the car. For these reasons, A and B are incorrect. D is incorrect because the dealer's statement that the car is as smooth-riding a car as you can get is either an opinion that is open to question or, more likely, a statement of ""puffery"" upon which the buyer should not have relied.","Defenses to Enforceability"

Under the UCC, any trade usage that is observed with sufficient regularity so as to justify an expectation that the parties contracted with reference to it can be introduced to interpret the parties' agreement, so long as the usage can be reasonably construed as being consistent with the express terms of the contract. The distribution contract between the distribution company and Fizzy required the distribution company to promote the sale of Fizzy Cola in good faith but did not specify whether the distribution company was restricted from distributing competing brands. Trade usage demonstrating that soft drink distributors uniformly handle only one brand of cola would strengthen Fizzy's argument because it is objective evidence that the agreement prohibits the distribution company from distributing competitors' brands of cola. A, B and C are incorrect because each of these facts, in and of itself, is only inconclusive evidence that the distribution company may have breached its obligation to promote Fizzy Cola in good faith.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"For an agreed price of $20 million, a builder contracted with a property owner to design and build on the property owner's commercial plot a 15-story office building. In excavating for the foundation and underground utilities, the builder encountered a massive layer of granite at a depth of 15 feet. By reasonable safety criteria, the building's foundation required a minimum excavation of 25 feet. When the contract was made, neither the property owner nor the builder was aware of the subsurface granite, for the presence of which neither party had hired a qualified expert to test.

Claiming accurately that removal of enough granite to permit the construction as planned would cost him an additional $3 million and a probable net loss on the contract of $2 million, the builder refused to proceed with the work unless the property owner would promise to pay an additional $2.5 million for the completed building.

Generally, a contract may be rescinded due to mutual mistake of fact if the mistake relates to a fundamental assumption of the contract and has a material effect on the exchange. This holds true unless the court determines that the party asserting mistake should bear the risk of the mistake. Here, the builder is engaged in the business of excavation and had the opportunity to investigate the condition of the ground. Therefore, the builder should assume the risk that the ground included granite.

A is incorrect as impracticality requires an extreme, unreasonable, and unanticipated difficulty or expense. Here, there is only a change in the degree of difficulty resulting in a 15% increase in expense, which is the type of risk that a fixed-price construction contract is intended to cover. Therefore, the court will not excuse the contract based on severe impracticability. B is incorrect because the builder assumes the risk that the ground included granite. D is incorrect because the fact that the builder did not have actual notice of the existence of granite in the area does not alter the conclusion that the builder should bear the risk.","Formation of Contracts"
"A niece had worked in her aunt's bookstore for many years. The bookstore business, which was housed in a building that the aunt leased, was independently appraised at $200,000. The aunt decided to retire. She wrote to the niece, expressing her affection for the niece and offering to sell her the bookstore business for $125,000 if the landlord would agree to a transfer of the lease. The letter also specified when the aunt would transfer the business. The niece wrote back accepting her aunt's offer. In a phone call to the niece, the aunt stated that the landlord had approved the transfer of the lease and that she would now ask her attorney to draft a written contract so that there would be a record of the terms. Before the attorney had finished drafting the document, the aunt changed her mind about selling the business and informed the niece of her decision.

In an action for breach of contract brought by the niece against her aunt, is the niece likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because the motivation for the transfer of the business was the aunt's affection for her niece, not the price.","No, because the promised consideration was inadequate in light of the market value of the business.","Yes, because the condition concerning the landlord's assent to the transfer of the lease was beyond the control of either party.","Yes, because the document being drafted by the attorney was merely a record of an agreement already made, not a condition to it.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Manifestations of assent are sufficient to conclude an enforceable contract even though parties manifest intent to memorialize their agreement in a writing that is not subsequently prepared. Here, the parties' agreement on essential terms constituted the manifestation of mutual assent sufficient to create an enforceable contract. 

Answer A is incorrect. The niece's promise to pay $125,000 and the aunt's promise to sell the business constituted the requisite consideration to enforce the agreement. The fact that the aunt's promise to sell her business may have been induced, in part, by affection for her niece would not negate the existence of a bargained-for exchange between the niece and the aunt.

Answer B is incorrect. If a bargained-for exchange is present, there is no additional requirement, such as an equivalency of exchange, in order to satisfy the consideration requirement of an enforceable contract. The niece's promise to pay $125,000 and the aunt's promise to sell her business constituted consideration. In addition, the niece's promise to pay $125,000 for a business appraised at $200,000 does not constitute the gross inadequacy of exchange that so shocks the conscience as to warrant invalidating the agreement.

Answer C is incorrect. Conditions are often beyond the control of either party. The dispositive issue is whether the existence of an enforceable contract was conditioned on the attorney drafting a written agreement that reflected the niece's and aunt's understandings. Manifestations of assent are sufficient to conclude an enforceable contract even though parties manifest intent to memorialize their agreement in a writing that is not subsequently prepared.","Formation of Contracts"
"During negotiations to purchase a used car, a buyer asked a dealer whether the car had ever been in an accident. The dealer replied: ""It is a fine car and has been thoroughly inspected and comes with a certificate of assured quality. Feel free to have the car inspected by your own mechanic."" In actuality, the car had been in a major accident, and the dealer had repaired and repainted the car, successfully concealing evidence of the accident. The buyer declined to have the car inspected by his own mechanic, explaining that he would rely on the dealer's certificate of assured quality. At no time did the dealer disclose that the car had previously been in an accident. The parties then signed a contract of sale. After the car was delivered and paid for, the buyer learned that the car had been in a major accident.

If the buyer sues the dealer to rescind the transaction, is the buyer likely to succeed?",multiple-choice,"No, because the buyer had the opportunity to have the car inspected by his own mechanic and declined to do so.","No, because the dealer did not affirmatively assert that the car had not been in an accident.","Yes, because the contract was unconscionable.","Yes, because the dealer's statement was intentionally misleading and the dealer had concealed evidence of the accident.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. When a seller induces a buyer into consenting to a contract by means of a material misrepresentation, the resulting contract is voidable at the election of the buyer. In this case, the buyer asked a direct question about whether the car had ever been in an accident, and the seller gave an answer that a reasonable buyer would take as an assurance that the seller at least had no knowledge of the car's involvement in an accident. The accident history of the car would be material to the buyer's decision. The seller's statement, taken in context, and in light of the seller's active steps to conceal evidence of the damage and repair, would be the legal equivalent of a statement that the car had not been in an accident. The seller actively concealed the damage and would not escape responsibility for misleading the buyer merely because the seller did not answer the question more directly—by saying, for example, ""No, the car has never been in an accident.""

Answer A is incorrect. When a seller induces a buyer into consenting to a contract by means of a material misrepresentation, the resulting contract is voidable at the election of the buyer. Although there might be some instances in which a failure to independently inspect property might constitute a defense to a claim of misrepresentation, the facts of this case don't justify such a conclusion. The buyer is entitled to rely on the truth of material representations made by the seller, and need not conduct independent tests to see whether the seller is lying, even if such an independent test would reveal the lie. In this case, the seller actively concealed the damage, and would not escape responsibility for misleading the buyer merely because the seller did not answer the question more directly—by saying, for example, ""No, the car has never been in an accident.""

Answer B is incorrect. When a seller induces a buyer into consenting to a contract by means of a material misrepresentation, the resulting contract is voidable at the election of the buyer. In this case, the buyer asked a direct question about whether the car had ever been in an accident, and the seller gave an answer that a reasonable buyer would take as an assurance that the seller at least had no knowledge of the car's involvement in an accident. The seller's statement, taken in context, and in light of the seller's active steps to conceal evidence of the damage and repair, would be the legal equivalent of a statement that the car had not been in an accident. The seller actively concealed the damage and would not be permitted to escape being held responsible for misleading the buyer merely because the seller did not answer the question more directly—by saying, for example, ""No, the car has never been in an accident.""

Answer C is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the buyer may rescind the contract, but it misstates the reason why this is so. When a seller induces a buyer into consenting to a contract by means of a material misrepresentation, the resulting contract is voidable at the election of the buyer. Unconscionability arises when there are unfair terms, coupled with an unfair bargaining process. In some cases, unconscionability may be found where a seller has made misrepresentations, or concealed material facts, but not every case of misrepresentation presents a case of unconscionability. In this case, apart from the fact that the seller concealed the damage to the car, and gave a misleading answer to the buyer's question, there is insufficient evidence that the contract was unconscionable.",Remedies

"In a writing signed by both parties, a renowned architect agreed for a fee of $25,000 to design and supervise construction of a new house for a famous sculptor, the fee to be paid upon completion of the house. The architect and sculptor got along poorly, and, when the design plans were about two-thirds complete, they had a heated argument over the proper location of a marble staircase. Hoping to avoid such encounters, the architect, without the sculptor's knowledge, assigned to a newly-licensed architect practicing solo, ""all of my rights and duties under my design and construction supervision contract with the sculptor."" The newly-licensed architect expressly promised the renowned architect to carry out the work to the best of her ability.

Assume that the sculptor allowed the newly-licensed architect to proceed with the design work but that the newly-licensed architect, without legal excuse, abandoned the project shortly after construction began.

Which of the following legal conclusions are correct?",multiple-choice,"Both the renowned architect and the newly-licensed architect are liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by the newly-licensed architect's default.","The renowned architect is liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by the newly-licensed architect's default and the sculptor is indebted to the newly-licensed architect, on a divisible contract theory, for a prorated portion of the agreed $25,000 architect's fee promised to the renowned architect.","The newly-licensed architect is liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by her default and the sculptor is indebted to the newly-licensed architect, on a divisible contract theory, for a prorated portion of the agreed $25,000 architect's fee promised to the renowned architect.","Both the renowned architect and the newly-licensed architect are liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by the newly-licensed architect's default and the sculptor is indebted to the newly-licensed architect, on a divisible contract theory, for a prorated portion of the agreed $25,000 architect's fee promised to the renowned architect.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The renowned architect is liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by the newly-licensed architect's default because when a party delegates duties under a contract with the consent of the obligee (the sculptor), it does not result in a complete substitution of the delegatee (the newly-licensed architect) for the delegator (the renowned architect). The architect cannot unilaterally release himself from his obligation to the sculptor, and remains liable for the newly-licensed architect's failure to perform or defective performance.

The newly-licensed architect is liable to the sculptor for any legal damages caused by her default because a delegatee (the newly-licensed architect) becomes liable to the obligee (the sculptor) if the delegatee makes a promise to either the obligee or the delegator (the renowned architect) to perform under the contract, and the newly-licensed architect ""expressly promised the architect"" to perform.

However, the sculptor is not indebted to the newly-licensed architect for a prorated portion of the agreed $25,000 architect's fee promised to the renowned architect. This is because the parties did not intend for the contract to be one in which the mutual performances promised by the parties could be split into a number of smaller independent and self-contained sets of matching performances. To the extent that design and construction could be separated, the parties did not manifest this intent. Therefore, A is correct while B, C, and D are incorrect.","Third-Party Rights"
"A son, who knew nothing about horses, inherited a thoroughbred colt whose disagreeable behavior made him a pest around the barn. The son sold the colt for $1,500 to an experienced racehorse-trainer who knew of the son's ignorance about horses. At the time of the sale, the son said to the trainer, ""I hate to say it, but this horse is bad-tempered and nothing special.""

Assume that soon after the sale, the horse won three races and earned $400,000 for the trainer.

Which of the following additional facts, if established by the son, would best support his chance of obtaining rescission of the sale to the trainer?",multiple-choice,"The son did not know until after the sale that the purchaser was an experienced racehorse-trainer.","At a pre-sale exercise session of which the trainer knew that the son was not aware, the trainer clocked the horse in record-setting time, far surpassing any previous performance.","The horse was the only thoroughbred that the son owned, and the son did not know how to evaluate young and untested racehorses.","At the time of the sale, the son was angry and upset over an incident in which the horse had reared and thrown a rider.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. A person's nondisclosure of fact may be tantamount to a misrepresentation of fact sufficient to allow rescission of a contract where the person knows that disclosure of the fact would correct the other party's mistake with respect to a basic assumption of the contract, and where nondisclosure amounts to a failure to act in good faith. The fact that the horse earned $400,000 for the trainer soon after the sale (over 250 times the contract price) suggests that nondisclosure of the horse's true abilities related to a basic assumption of the contract relating to the horse's worth. If the son can establish that the trainer was aware that the horse was capable of running a race in record-setting time and that the son was ignorant of this fact, then the son has a plausible argument for rescission on grounds of nondisclosure. A and C are incorrect because neither the son's ignorance of the horse trainer's expertise nor the son's inexperience with evaluating horses alone would be sufficient to establish a basis for rescission. D is incorrect because the son's anger is irrelevant to the enforceability of the contract for the horse's sale.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"In January, a teacher contracted with a summer camp to serve as its head counselor at a salary of $10,000 for 10 weeks, from the first of June to the middle of August. In March, the camp notified the teacher that it had hired someone else as head counselor and that the teacher's services would not be needed. In April, the teacher spent $200 traveling to interview at the only other nearby summer camp for a position as its head counselor. The teacher was not chosen for that job. The teacher then took a position teaching in a local summer school at a salary of $6,000 for the same 10-week period. 

How much is the teacher entitled to recover as damages in a breach-of-contract action against the camp?",multiple-choice,"$4,000.","$4,200.","$10,000.","$10,200.",,,2,"B is correct. The teacher is entitled to be put in the position he would have been in if the contract had been performed. Application of this principle leads to recovery of the difference between the contract salary ($10,000) and the amount earned at the local summer school ($6,000), plus the reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach ($200 in travel expenses). Mitigation expenses can be recovered, if reasonable, even if those particular expenses are not connected to a successful mitigation attempt. 

A is incorrect. The goal is to put the teacher in the position he would have occupied but for the breach. $4,000 is a wrong answer because it fails to provide for recovery of the $200 expense the teacher incurred in the reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, effort to mitigate damages by applying for the head counselor position at the other summer camp. The fact that the effort to mitigate was unsuccessful does not mean that the expense is not recoverable. Accordingly, the teacher is entitled to recover the difference between the contract salary ($10,000) and the amount earned at the local summer school ($6,000), plus the reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach ($200 in travel expenses). 

C is incorrect. The goal is to put the teacher in the position he would have occupied but for the breach. An award of $10,000 would overcompensate the teacher, violating the principle of expectation damages. The teacher successfully sought other employment for the same time period as covered in the contract, and the amount earned on that job must be taken into account in calculating damages. There is no suggestion here that the teacher could have held both jobs simultaneously, earning both salaries. In addition, this answer fails to compensate the teacher for the travel expenses incurred in mitigating damages. The fact that the effort to mitigate was unsuccessful does not mean that the expense is not recoverable. The proper recovery is the difference between the contract salary ($10,000) and the amount earned at the local summer school ($6,000), plus the reasonable expenses incurred in seeking to mitigate after the breach ($200 in travel expenses). 

D is incorrect. The goal is to put the teacher in the position he would have occupied but for the breach.

"A buyer entered into a written contract to purchase from a seller 1,000 sets of specially manufactured ball bearings of a nonstandard dimension for a price of $10 per set. The seller correctly calculated that it would cost $8 to manufacture each set. Delivery was scheduled for 60 days later. Fifty-five days later, after the seller had completed production of the 1,000 sets, the buyer abandoned the project requiring use of the specially manufactured ball bearings and repudiated the contract with the seller.

What damages should the court award to the seller?",multiple-choice,"$2 per set, representing the difference between the cost of manufacture and the price the buyer agreed to pay.","$6 per set, representing the difference between the cost of manufacture and the salvage price.","$8 per set, representing the lost profits plus the unrecovered cost of manufacture.","Nominal damages, as the seller failed to resell the goods by public auction.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The Uniform Commercial Code controls in this situation. The seller is entitled to be put in the position it would have been in if the contract had been performed.

Accordingly, the seller should recover $2 + $8 - $2 = $8 per set.

Answer A is incorrect. The Uniform Commercial Code controls. The seller is entitled to be put in the position it would have been in if the contract had been performed. Two dollars per set fails to accomplish that goal. This would have been a correct answer ONLY IF the seller had not yet begun manufacturing the ball bearings. The seller incurred those costs in preparing for performance, and is entitled to recover them in order to protect its expectation interest. As explained above, the proper measure of damages here is the profit the seller would have made plus an allowance for costs reasonably incurred, minus payments received for resale of the goods.

Answer B is incorrect. The Uniform Commercial Code controls. The seller is entitled to be put in the position it would have been in if the contract had been performed. Six dollars per set fails to accomplish that goal. The difference between the cost of manufacture and the salvage price fails to take account of the lost profit the seller is entitled to recover.

"For several weeks, a wealthy, unemployed widow and a car dealer negotiated unsuccessfully over the purchase price of a new sports car. The car dealer knew the widow wanted her son to have the sports car as a wedding gift. On April 27, the car dealer sent the widow a signed, dated memo saying, ""If we can arrive at the same price within the next week, do we have a deal?"" The widow wrote ""Yes"" and her signature at the bottom of his memo and delivered it back to the car dealer on April 29.

On May 1, the widow wrote the car dealer a signed letter offering to buy ""one new sports car, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1."" By coincidence, the car dealer wrote the widow a signed letter on May 1 offering to sell her ""one new sports car, with all available equipment, for $180,000 cash on delivery not later than June 1."" These letters crossed in the mail and were respectively received and read by the widow and the car dealer on May 2.

On May 4, the widow and the car dealer both signed a single document evidencing a contract for the sale by the car dealer to the widow, ""as a wedding gift for the widow's son,"" a new sports car, under the same terms as previously stated in their correspondence. On May 5, the widow handed the son a carbon copy of this document. On May 20, in reliance on the prospective gift the son sold his nearly new luxury SUV to a dealer at a ""bargain"" price of $50,000. The son immediately informed the widow and the car dealer that he had done so.

On May 25, however, the widow and the car dealer by mutual agreement rescinded in a signed writing ""any and all agreements heretofore made between the undersigned parties for the sale-and-purchase of a new sports car."" Later that day, the car dealer sold for $190,000 cash to another buyer the only new sports car that it had in stock or could readily obtain elsewhere.

The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary unless and until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise before receiving notice of the discharge.

"A tenant rented a commercial building from a landlord and operated a business in it. The building's large front window was smashed by vandals six months before expiration of the tenant-landlord lease. The tenant, who was obligated thereunder to effect and pay for repairs in such cases, promptly contracted with a window company to replace the window for $2,000, due 30 days after satisfactory completion of work. The landlord was then unaware of the tenant-window company contract. The window company was aware that the building was under lease, but dealt entirely with the tenant.

Sixty days after the window company's satisfactory completion of the window replacement, and prior to the expiration of the tenant's lease, the tenant, then insolvent, ceased doing business and vacated the building. In so doing, the tenant forfeited under the lease provisions its right to the return of a $2,000 security deposit with the landlord. The deposit had been required, however, for the express purpose (as stated in the lease) of covering any damage to the leased property except ordinary wear and tear. The only such damage occuring during the tenant's occupancy was the smashed window. The window company's $2,000 bill for the window replacement is wholly unpaid.

Upon vacating the building, the tenant mailed a $1,000 check to the window company bearing on its face the following conspicuous notation: ""This check is in full and final satisfaction of your $2,000 window replacement bill."" Without noticing this notation, the window company cashed the check and now sues the tenant for the $1,000 difference.

Under rules of accord and satisfaction, a debtor may make an offer to settle a dispute by offering a check marked ""payment in full."" If the notation was sufficiently plain that the creditor should have understood it, then cashing the check without protest amounts to an acceptance of the offer of an accord and satisfaction of the debt. Mere payment of a lesser sum would not be sufficient consideration to support the modification, however, unless the amount owed to the creditor is not liquidated (i.e., genuinely in dispute). Although the tenant made an offer for an accord in satisfaction that the window company accepted when it cashed the check, it was not enforceable because it lacked consideration - the amount of and basis for the debt which the tenant owed to the window company was not in dispute.

A is incorrect because the ""payment in full"" notation was sufficiently conspicuous to put the window company on notice of its existence. C and D are incorrect because an accord and satisfaction is not enforceable unless the debt is genuinely in dispute (in any event, cashing a check with a reservation-of-rights notation most likely would not help the window company).","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"

What is the buyer's remedy because the wool was nonconforming?",multiple-choice,"Specific performance.","Damages measured by the difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods.","Damages measured by the price paid plus the difference between the contract price and the cost of buying substitute goods.","None, since he waived his remedies by agreeing to pay before inspection.",,,3,"C is correct. A buyer is entitled to reject nonconforming goods and to obtain damages pursuant to UCC 2-712(2), which is calculated as the difference between the cost of cover for substitute goods and the contract price.

A is incorrect. There are no facts to support a conclusion that blue wool No. 1 quality is unique or that there are other proper circumstances pursuant to UCC 2-716(1), such as an inability to cover.

B is incorrect. The difference between the value of the goods delivered and the value of conforming goods is the appropriate remedy under UCC 2-714 for accepted goods. This would be the remedy if the buyer kept the No. 2 wool; however, the buyer tendered the goods back to the seller.

D is incorrect. Payment prior to inspection does not constitute an acceptance or a waiver of any contract remedies under UCC 2-512(2).",Remedies
"A property owner and a landscape architect signed a detailed writing in which the landscape architect agreed to landscape the owner's residential property in accordance with a design prepared by the landscape architect and incorporated in the writing. The owner agreed to pay $10,000 for the work upon its completion. The owner's spouse was not a party to the agreement and had no ownership interest in the premises.

Shortly before the agreement was signed, the owner and landscape architect orally agreed that the writing would not become binding on either party unless the owner's spouse should approve the landscaping design.

If the owner's spouse disapproves of the design and the owner refuses to allow the landscape architect to proceed with the work, is evidence of the oral agreement admissible in the landscape architect's action against the owner for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the oral agreement required approval by a third party.","Yes, because the evidence shows that the writing was intended to take effect only if the approval occurred.","No, because the parol evidence rule bars evidence of a prior oral agreement even if the latter is consistent with the terms of a partial integration.","No, because the prior oral agreement contradicted the writing by making the parties' duties conditional.",,,2,"B is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of a prior agreement either where the prior agreement contradicts the terms of a final written agreement or where the prior agreement purports to add to a completely integrated agreement (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). An exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to prove the existence of a condition precedent to the written agreement. Therefore, evidence of the owner and landscape architect's oral agreement is admissible because it demonstrated the existence of a condition precedent to the writing's taking effect.

A is incorrect. The oral agreement would not be admissible unless it fits within one of the exceptions to the parol evidence rule. C and D are incorrect. Evidence of the oral agreement falls within one of the exceptions to the rule.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A manufacturer of computers pays its salespeople a salary of $1,000 per month and a commission of 5 percent on billings actually rendered for machines that they sell. The manufacturer's sales people are employed at will under written agreements which provide that in order to receive a commission, the salesperson must be in the employment of the manufacturer when the bill is sent to the customer.

In 2006, a salesperson for the manufacturer worked for eight months to get an order from a large corporation for a $750,000 computer. He consulted extensively with the corporation's top executives and worked with its operating personnel to develop detailed specifications for the new equipment. He also promised the corporation, with the manufacturer's knowledge and approval, to assist the corporation for six months after installation in making the equipment work.

On January 1, 2007, the corporation signed an order, and on March 1, the computer was installed. On March 15, the manufacturer fired the salesperson on the stated ground that he had failed to meet his 2005 and 2006 sales quotas. The salesperson thought that the manufacturer was correct in this statement. A coworker was thereupon assigned to service the corporation account. On March 31, the manufacturer billed the corporation for the computer.

Which of the following, if shown by the evidence, would support a claim by the salesperson against the manufacturer?",multiple-choice,"The manufacturer terminated the salesperson because the coworker is the son of the company's president, who wanted his son to have the commission instead of the salesperson.","The manufacturer and the salesperson were mistaken; the salesperson had in fact exceeded his sales quotas for 2005 and 2006.","The manufacturer and the salesperson were mistaken because the salesperson had in fact exceeded his sales quotas for 2005 and 2006; the manufacturer terminated the salesperson because the coworker is the son of the company's president, who wanted his son to have the commission instead of the salesperson.","The salesperson had worked for the manufacturer as a salesperson for 20 years.",,,3,"C is correct. The fact that the salesperson had worked for the manufacturer as a salesperson for 20 years is not relevant and would not support a claim against the manufacturer because either party can terminate the employment relationship at any time in an ""at-will"" employment contract as long as the reason does not violate public policy. Although length of employment may be persuasive as to the salesperson's character as a good employee, here the salesperson was fired due to failure to meet sales quotas, so the length of his employment is not relevant.

A, B and D are incorrect. By itself, the fact that the manufacturer terminated the salesperson because he wanted his son to have the commission instead of the salesperson would not support a claim because if the salesperson had failed to meet the sales quota, his dismissal would have been legitimate. Likewise, the fact that the salesperson had exceeded his sales quotas for 2005 and 2006, taken alone, would not support a claim because termination based on a mistaken fact is insufficient to negate the employer's right to terminate an at-will relationship because there is no showing of bad faith. However, when taken together, the fact that the salesperson exceeded his sales quotas and the fact that the manufacturer terminated the salesperson because he wanted his son to have the commission instead of the salesperson can establish bad faith and lack of legitimate cause. This would demonstrate that the reason for the salesperson's firing was against public policy, and made solely to deprive the salesperson of a substantial commission.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"During 2006 a series of arsons, one of which damaged a huge store, occurred in a city. In early 2007 the city's City Council adopted this resolution:

The City will pay $10,000 for the arrest and conviction of anyone guilty of any of the 2006 arsons committed here.
The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 ""for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire."" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store. The city, which has no immunity to suit, has since refused to pay the detective anything, although he swears that he never heard of the city's repealer before claiming its reward.

In a suit by the detective against the city to recover the $10,000 reward, which of the following, in light of the facts given, most usefully supports the detective's claim?",multiple-choice,"The city was benefited as a result of the detective's services.","The city's offer was in the nature of a bounty, so that the elements of contract are not essential to the city's liability.","The fact that the city attempted to revoke its offer only a few months after making it demonstrated that the attempted revocation was in bad faith.","Although there was no bargained for exchange between the detective and the city, the detective's claim for the reward is supported by a moral obligation on the part of the city.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. If the reward were characterized as a government bounty, the detective's knowledge of the reward after obtaining the confession and the earlier attempted revocation would not be determinative.

A is incorrect because although the city benefited, the detective had no reasonable expectation of payment from the city due to his lack of knowledge of the offer, the prior revocation, and the fact that his expectation of payment was from the huge store. C is incorrect. The city was free to revoke the offer for any reason so long as the city revoked by means of general notification equal to that given to the offer. D is also incorrect because even if the reward would create a moral obligation, the city made no subsequent promise to pay the detective. If the reward itself comprised the promise upon which a moral obligation might arise, such an obligation would not arise for an individual who remained unaware of the promise.","Formation of Contracts"
"In a writing signed by both parties, a renowned architect agreed for a fee of $25,000 to design and supervise construction of a new house for a famous sculptor, the fee to be paid upon completion of the house. The architect and sculptor got along poorly, and, when the design plans were about two-thirds complete, they had a heated argument over the proper location of a marble staircase. Hoping to avoid such encounters, the architect, without the sculptor's knowledge, assigned to a newly-licensed architect practicing solo, ""all of my rights and duties under my design and construction supervision contract with the sculptor."" The newly-licensed architect expressly promised the architect to carry out the work to the best of her ability.

Assume that the sculptor on learning of the assignment refused to allow the newly-licensed architect to proceed as architect and brought an action against the renowned architect to compel him to resume and complete performance of the contract.

Is the sculptor entitled to such relief?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the renowned architect's services under the contract are unique.","Yes, because the renowned architect has personally completed two-thirds of the design work.","No, because the architect-sculptor contract is one for personal services by the renowned architect.","No, because the renowned architect effectively delegated his remaining duties under the architect-sculptor contract to the newly-licensed architect.",,,3,"C is correct. Specific performance is not an available remedy in a dispute involving a contract for personal services because such an order might violate the involuntary servitude clause of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and such an order would be difficult to supervise and enforce. Contract remedies also reflect a reluctance to restrict individual autonomy and instead permit breach followed by payment of damages.

A is incorrect. The more liberal standard allowing specific performance under the UCC when goods are unique, 2-716(1), is not applicable in a contract for personal services. B is incorrect. Damages can be awarded to effectuate the sculptor's expectation interest under the contract via substitute performance. D is incorrect. The contract required personal judgment and skill, and thus cannot be delegated.",Remedies
"In a written contract, an architect agreed to draw up the plans for and to supervise construction of a client's new house. In return, the client agreed to pay the architect a fee of $10,000 to be paid upon the house's completion. After completion, the client claimed erroneously but in good faith that the architect's plans were defective. The client orally offered to pay the architect $7,500 in full settlement of the claim for the fee. The architect orally accepted that offer despite the fact that the reasonable value of his services was in fact $10,000. The client paid the architect $7,500 pursuant to their agreement.

The architect subsequently sued the client for the remaining $2,500. In a preliminary finding, the trier of fact found that there were no defects in the architect's plans.

Will the architect be likely to prevail in his action against the client for $2,500?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because payment of $7,500 cannot furnish consideration for the architect's promise to surrender his claim.","Yes, because the oral agreement to modify the written contract is not enforceable.","No, because the architect's promise to accept $7,500 became binding when the client made the payment.","No, because the architect's acceptance of partial payment constituted a novation.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. An accord occurs when one party to a contract agrees to accept performance different from the performance promised in the original agreement. An accord generally requires >consideration, which can be less than that called for in the original contract. Payment of a lesser amount than is due on a valid claim constitutes valid consideration if there is a bona fide dispute as to the amount owed, and the dispute is made in good faith. Satisfaction is the performance of the accord, and it discharges both the accord and the original debt. 

The architect's agreement to accept a payment for less than the amount due constituted an effective accord, supported by consideration, which was satisfied with the payment of $7,500. Consideration is present because of the good faith dispute as to the amount owed. By compromising, each party surrenders its respective claim as to how much is owed. Thus, Answer C is correct. 

Answer A is incorrect. The rule of Foakes v. Beer, which is a specific application of the pre-existing duty rule, provides that part payment of a liquidated debt is invalid for a lack of consideration. The rule does not apply, however, where there is a compromise of a claim disputed in good faith. This exception applies even if it later becomes apparent that the reason for disputing the claim was invalid. 

Answer B is incorrect. The statute of frauds is removed as a defense when an oral agreement is fully performed. Moreover, the dispositive issue is whether consideration exists to enforce the agreement to settle the claim, which it does in a compromise of a claim disputed in good faith, regardless of the reason for the dispute. 

Answer D is incorrect. A novation arises where either one or both of the parties to a contract is replaced by a third party. The architect's acceptance of payment does not constitute a novation since neither the client nor the architect was replaced by a third party. In this case, the architect's agreement to accept a payment for less than the amount due constituted an effective accord, supported by consideration, which was satisfied with the payment of $7,500.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A wealthy widow, wishing to make a substantial and potentially enduring gift to her beloved adult stepson, established with a bank a passbook savings account by an initial deposit of $10,000.

The passbook was issued solely in the stepson's name, but the widow retained possession of it, and the stepson was not then informed of the savings account. Subsequently, the widow became disgusted with the stepson's behavior and decided to give the same savings account solely to her beloved adult daughter. As permitted by the rules of the bank, the widow effected this change by agreement with the bank. This time she left possession of the passbook with the bank. Shortly thereafter, the stepson learned of the original savings account in his name and the subsequent switch to the widow's daughter's name.

If the stepson now sues the bank for $10,000 plus accrued interest, will the action succeed?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the stepson was a third-party intended beneficiary of the original widow-bank deposit agreement.","Yes, because the stepson was a constructive assignee of the widow's claim, as depositor, to the savings account.","No, because the stepson never obtained possession of the passbook.","No, because the stepson's right, if any, to the funds on deposit was effectively abrogated by the second widow-bank deposit agreement.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. To the extent that the stepson was a third-party beneficiary of the deposit agreement, his rights were abrogated before they vested because he neither knew about nor relied upon the existence of the deposit account prior to abrogation. For this reason A is incorrect. B is incorrect because the widow did not assign her rights under another agreement to her stepson when she established the first deposit agreement. C is incorrect because the stepson's possession of the passbook was not necessary for the right to vest. His possession would constitute performance of the duty to him under the contract after the right had vested.","Third-Party Rights"
"A high-volume, pleasure-boat retailer entered into with a boater, a written contract signed by both parties, to sell the boater a power boat for $12,000. The manufacturer's price of the boat delivered to the retailer was $9,500. As the contract provided, the boater paid the retailer $4,000 in advance and promised to pay the full balance upon delivery of the boat. The contract contained no provision for liquidated damages. Prior to the agreed delivery date, the boater notified the retailer that he would be financially unable to conclude the purchase; the retailer thereupon resold the same boat that the boater had ordered to a third person for $12,000.

If the boater sues the retailer for restitution of the $4,000 advance payment, which of the following should the court decide?",multiple-choice,"The boater's claim should be denied, because, as the party in default, he is deemed to have lost any right to restitution of a benefit conferred on the retailer.","The boater's claim should be denied, because, but for his repudiation, the retailer would have made a profit on two boat-sales instead of one.","The boater's claim should be upheld in the amount of $4,000 minus the amount of the retailer's lost profit under its contract with the boater.","The boater's claims should be upheld in the amount of $3,500 ($4,000 minus $500 as statutory damages under the UCC).",,,3,"C is correct. By repudiating his obligation to pay the remainder of the contract price, the boater breached and the retailer is entitled to recover expectation damages. Since the retailer is a volume seller, under UCC Article 2 the retailer is entitled to the expected profit from the lost sale even though the same product was resold at the original price. Therefore, the boater will only be able to recover his down payment of $4,000 minus the profit lost by the retailer from having the original sale fall through.

A is incorrect. It would be an unjust enrichment for the retailer to retain an amount greater than its losses under the contract.

B is incorrect. The conclusion is incorrect, however, it has the correct reasoning. The retailer is entitled to the expected profit from the lost sale but he is not automatically entitled to the full $4,000 advance payment.

D is incorrect. As the party who breached the contract, the boater is not entitled to damages. The boater is only entitled to the restitution of the down payment which exceeds the damages caused by his breach.",Remedies
"A lawn service company agreed in writing to purchase from a supplier all of its requirements for lawn care products during the next calendar year. In the writing, the supplier agreed to fulfill those requirements and to give the company a 10% discount off its published prices, but it reserved the right to increase the published prices during the year. After the parties had performed under the agreement for three months, the supplier notified the company that it would no longer give the company the 10% discount off the published prices.

Does the company have a viable claim against the supplier for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because part performance of the agreement by both parties made it enforceable for the full year.","Yes, because the company's agreement to buy all of its lawn care products from the supplier made the agreement enforceable.","No, because the supplier could, and did, revoke its offer with respect to future deliveries.","No, because the absence of a minimum quantity term rendered the company's promise illusory.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The parties entered into an enforceable requirements contract under UCC § 2-306. Although the terms of the parties' agreement granted the supplier the discretion to increase the published prices during the year, the contract did not grant the supplier the right to discontinue the promised 10% discount off the published prices. The supplier's refusal to give the company the 10% discount was a breach of the contract's agreed-upon terms. Thus, Answer B is correct.

Answer A is incorrect. The contract is enforceable because the parties entered into an enforceable requirements contract under UCC § 2-306. Pursuant to the terms of their contract, the parties agreed to a one-year term. Therefore, part performance is not required in order for the contract to be enforceable for a full year.

Answer C is incorrect. Revocation relates to the contract formation process. Given that mutual assent has occurred, revocation is not a relevant issue. The parties entered into an enforceable requirements contract under UCC § 2-306.

Answer D is incorrect. UCC § 2-306(1) validates the enforceability of requirements contracts even if the parties do not include a minimum quantity term in their agreement. Therefore, the absence of a minimum quantity term in the parties' requirements contract did not render it illusory, and the contract is enforceable under UCC § 2-306.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On January 2, a landowner and a builder entered into a written contract in which the builder agreed to build on the landowner's lot a new house for the landowner, according to plans and specifications furnished by the landowner's architect at a contract price of $200,000. The contract provided for specified progress payments and a final payment of $40,000 upon the landowner's acceptance of the house and issuance of a certificate of final approval by the architect. Further, under a ""liquidated damages"" clause in the agreement, the builder promised to pay the homeowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1. The homeowner, however, told the builder on January 2, before the contract was signed, that he would be on an around-the-world vacation trip most of the summer and fall and would not return to occupy the house until November 1.

Because she was overextended on other construction jobs, the builder did not complete the house until October 15. The landowner returned on November 1 as planned and occupied the house. Ten days later, after making the $40,000 final payment to the builder, the landowner learned for the first time that the house had not been completed until October 15.

If the landowner sues the builder for breach of contract on account of the fifteen-day delay in completion, which of the following will the court probably decide?",multiple-choice,"The homeowner will recover damages as specified in the contract, i.e., $500 multiplied by fifteen.","The homeowner will recover his actual damages, if any, caused by the delay in completion.","Having waived the delay by occupying the house and making the final payment, the landowner will recover nothing.","The landowner will recover nothing because the contractual completion date was impliedly modified to November 1 when the landowner on January 2 advised the builder about the landowner's prospective trip and return date.",,,2,"B is correct. Both parties knew that the landowner would not be available to take possession on October 1. The liquidated damages provision thus operates as a penalty and will not be enforced because it does not fix damages in light of anticipated or actual harm. Damages will thus be limited to any harm the landowner suffered in taking possession two weeks after the stated completion date.

A is incorrect. For the reasons stated above. C is incorrect. Occupation and payment without knowledge of the delay cannot constitute a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a right. D is incorrect. This statement, standing alone, is insufficient to indicate the landowner's intent to modify the completion date.",Remedies
"A contractor painted an owner's house under a contract which called for payment of $2,000. The owner, contending in good faith that the porch had not been painted properly, refused to pay anything.

Thereafter the owner mailed a check for $1,800 marked ""Payment in full on the painting contract as per letter dated June 18."" The contractor received the check on June 30. Because he was badly in need of money, the contractor cashed the check without objection and spent the proceeds but has refused to repaint the porch.

The owner's refusal to pay anything to the contractor when he finished painting was a",multiple-choice,"partial breach of contract only if the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.","partial breach of contract whether or not the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.","total breach of contract only if the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.","total breach of contract whether or not the contractor had properly or substantially painted the porch.",,,3,"C is correct. Sometimes it is implied that the duty to render performance under a contract is conditional upon the occurrence of some event, even though the contract does not explicitly state so. In such a case, there is said to be a constructive condition where the duty of each party to render performance is conditioned on the other party rendering his performance. Therefore, under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a contractor's material breach of contract may justify the owner from withholding performance. However, if the contractor has substantially performed on the contract, the owner is still obligated to perform. Therefore, the owner's refusal to pay any of the amount due under the contract would be a total breach.

A and B are incorrect. A partial breach occurs when there is a failure to meet a term of a contract that does not cause the contract to fail or justify a breach by the other contracting party. As stated above, the owner's refusal to pay would not be a partial breach, it would be a total breach of contract. D is incorrect. If the contractor had not substantially performed, the owner would be justified in withholding performance.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"On March 1, a mechanic agreed to repair an owner's machine for $5,000, to be paid on completion of the work. On March 15, before the work was completed, the mechanic sent a letter to the owner with a copy to the mechanic's creditor, telling the owner to pay $5,000 to the creditor. The mechanic then completed the work.

Which of the following, if true, would best serve the owner as a defense in an action brought against him by the creditor for $5,000?",multiple-choice,"The creditor was incapable of performing the mechanic's work.","The mechanic had not performed his work in a workmanlike manner.","On March 1, the mechanic had promised the owner that he would not assign the contract.","The creditor was not the intended beneficiary of the mechanic-owner contract.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The mechanic was not entitled to payment unless he satisfied his contractual duties. Every contract for work or services contains an implied duty to perform in good faith or in a workmanlike manner. The mechanic would still have to perform his obligations in good faith and in a workmanlike manner for owner to be obligated to pay. Payment then may be made to the creditor because the mechanic had assigned his rights under the contract to the creditor.

Answer A is incorrect because the mechanic was not delegating his duties to the creditor under the contract; he was assigning his right to payment. The mechanic was still obligated to perform the work. Answer C is incorrect. Generally, all contractual rights may be assigned with some exceptions. Even a clause in the contract prohibiting the assignment of contractual rights does not in fact bar assignment. The assignor still has the power to assign, but not the right. Although, the consequence of such a clause does give the obligator the right to sue for breach if an assignment is made, the assignment is still effective.

Answer D is incorrect. Even though the creditor is not an intended beneficiary, he still has contract rights against the owner. This is an assignment, which is different than a third party beneficiary situation. The difference is, in a third party beneficiary situation, the original contract will confer the rights and duties on the third party. However, in an assignment the original contract does not confer any rights or obligations on the third party, but subsequently one of the parties has transferred his rights under the contract to the third party (assignment). If there was a valid assignment of payment to the creditor from the mechanic, and the mechanic performed, then the creditor can sue the owner for payment.","Third-Party Rights"
"A woman entered into a contract with a painter, by the terms of which the painter was to paint the woman's office for $1,000 and was required to do all of the work over the following weekend so as to avoid disruption of the woman's business.

Assume the following facts. If the painter had started to paint on the following Saturday morning, he could have finished before Sunday evening. However, he stayed home that Saturday morning to watch the final game of the World Series on TV and did not start to paint until Saturday afternoon. By late Saturday afternoon, the painter realized that he had underestimated the time it would take to finish the work over the weekend unless he hired a helper. He also stated that to do so would require an additional charge of $200 for the work. The woman told the painter that she apparently had no choice but to pay ""whatever it takes"" to get the work done as scheduled.

The painter hired a friend to help finish the painting and paid the friend $200. The woman has offered to pay the painter $1,000. The painter is demanding $1,200.

How much is the painter likely to recover?",multiple-choice,"$1,000 only, because the woman received no consideration for her promise to pay the additional sum.","$1,000 only, because the woman's promise to pay ""whatever it takes"" is too uncertain to be enforceable.","$1,200, in order to prevent the woman's unjust enrichment.","$1,200, because the impossibility of the painter's completing the work alone discharged the original contract and a new contract was formed.",,,1,"A is correct. A unilateral modification of a contract (such as the woman's promise to pay an additional $200 for the same work) lacks consideration because of the preexisting duty rule. However, some unilateral modifications may be enforceable notwithstanding the lack of additional consideration if the modification was done in good faith in light of circumstances that the parties did not anticipate at the time the contract was formed. Because the painter should have anticipated the circumstances that required his hiring an extra worker, the modification is not enforceable and the woman is not bound by her promise to pay the extra $200. B is incorrect. The promise viewed in the context of the painter's demand was sufficiently definite. C is incorrect. Unjust enrichment is not applicable where the benefit has been conferred pursuant to a binding contract. D is incorrect.

"On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of programs for the department store's computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety:

The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store's Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing.


On June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After the department store denied liability, the parties orally agreed that the department store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the department store computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs. Tests then showed that the computer programs cut processing time by only 47 percent.

The department store's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.

Was the escrow agreement a valid modification?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because it was the compromise of an honest dispute.","Yes, because the Statute of Frauds does not apply to subsequent oral modifications.","No, because it was oral.","No, because it was not supported by consideration.",,,1,"A is correct. The escrow agreement is valid as a subsequent oral modification. The agreement is not governed by the UCC because the contract is predominantly a services contract for developing software. Therefore, section 2-209(2) of the UCC, which expressly makes a ""no oral modification"" clause enforceable, does not apply. Instead, under common law, a contract provision stating that all future modifications must be made in writing is not an effective bar to subsequent oral modification. Furthermore, since this is a services contract that can be completed within a year, the Statute of Frauds does not apply. The other issue is a lack of consideration for the creation of the escrow account. Generally, the performance of a preexisting legal duty is not valid consideration. However, since there was an honest dispute about the legal duty owed, the escrow agreement would be exempt from the consideration requirement. Therefore, the escrow account is a valid modification.

B is incorrect. This is a misstatement of the law. The Statute of Frauds will apply to a subsequent oral modification if the modified contract falls under the Statute of Frauds.

C is incorrect. The fact that the escrow agreement was oral does not automatically invalidate it. Under common law, a provision that all future modifications must be made in writing is not an effective bar to subsequent oral modification.

D is incorrect. The escrow account was a compromise of an honest dispute about the duty owed, so no additional consideration was necessary.","Formation of Contracts"
"While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: ""I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident."" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries.

The father said: ""If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you.""

If the physician discontinued treating the woman before she had fully recovered and the woman brought an action against the physician for breach of contract, which of the following would be the best defense for the physician?",multiple-choice,"The woman furnished no consideration, either express or implied.","The physician's contract was with the father and not with the woman.","Whatever contract the physician may have had with the woman was discharged by novation on account of the agreement with the father.","The father has not paid any of the medical bills sent to him by the physician.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. This question involves the rights and duties of third parties to a contract. A third-party beneficiary is a person who is not a party to a contract, but has the legal right to enforce the contract or share in the proceeds because the contract was made for the third party's benefit. Only intended third-party beneficiaries have contract rights. Whether a person is an intended beneficiary depends on the intent of the parties. Here, the woman is an intended third-party beneficiary because the father agreed to pay the physician for her treatment. Therefore, she can bring an action against the physician for breach of contract. The physician, the promisor, is allowed the same defenses against the woman, the third party. as he would be against the father, the promisee.

The physician may assert that the father materially breached the contract by failing to pay any of the woman's medical bills up to that point. A material breach occurs when the obligee does not receive the substantial benefit of the bargain as a result of the failure to perform or a defective performance. In this case, the father failed to perform by not paying any of the woman's medical bills and so materially breached the contract. The nonbreaching party (i) may treat the contract as being discharged, and (ii) will have an immediate right to all remedies for breach of the entire contract. Therefore, the physician would be allowed to discontinue treatment of the woman.

Answer A is not an effective defense because there was bargained-for consideration provided by another party. It is immaterial that the consideration was provided by the father instead of the beneficiary (the woman). Thus, answer A is incorrect. 

Answer B is not an effective defense. Although the woman was not a party to the contract between the father and the physician, she is an intended third-party beneficiary. The woman can enforce the contract because her rights as an intended third-party beneficiary vested when she assented to the promise by seeking treatment from the physician. Thus, answer B is incorrect.

Answer C is not an effective defense because a novation is an express agreement by all parties to substitute a new party for an original party to a contract. Here, the woman is not being substituted for the father, she is merely an intended third-party beneficiary. Thus, answer C is incorrect.","Third-Party Rights"
"A buyer contracted in writing with a shareholder, who owned all of XYZ Corporation's outstanding stock, to purchase all of her stock at a specified price per share. At the time this contract was executed, the buyer's contracting officer said to the shareholder, ""Of course, our commitment to buy is conditioned on our obtaining approval of the contract from our parent company."" The shareholder replied, ""Fine. No problem.""

Assume that the parent company orally approved the contract, but that the shareholder changed her mind and refused to consummate the sale on two grounds: (1) when the agreement was made there was no consideration for her promise to sell, and (2) the parent company's approval of the contract was invalid.

If the buyer sues the shareholder for breach of contract, is the buyer likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the buyer's promise to buy, bargained for and made in exchange for the shareholder's promise to sell, was good consideration even though it was expressly conditioned on an event that was not certain to occur.","Yes, because any possible lack of consideration for the shareholder's promise to sell was expressly waived by the shareholder when the agreement was made.","No, because mutuality of obligation between parties was lacking when the agreement was made.","No, because the condition of the parent company's approval of the contract was an essential part of the agreed exchange and was not in a signed writing.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms the promisor unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances, such as reserving the right to cancel the contract. Such a promise is an illusory promise. However, where a promisor's obligation is conditioned upon the occurrence of an event that is outside of the promisor's control, the mere fact that the obligation is subject to a condition does not render the promise illusory. Because the buyer presumably does not control the actions of its parent company, the fact that the buyer's obligation is conditioned upon the parent company's approval does not render it illusory, since the buyer will be bound once the condition is satisfied, and the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the condition is for the most part outside of the buyer's control.

B is incorrect because the shareholder agreed to the condition; it is not a waiver. C is incorrect because there is mutuality of obligation in that each party made a binding promise. D is incorrect because the fact that the parent company's approval was not in writing does not render it invalid.","Formation of Contracts"
"On January 15, a carpenter agreed to repair a homeowner's house according to certain specifications and to have the work completed by April 1. On March 1, the homeowner's property was inundated by flood waters which did not abate until March 15. The homeowner could not get the house in a condition which would permit the carpenter to begin the repairs until March 31. On that date the carpenter notified the homeowner that he would not repair the house.

Which one of the following facts, if it was the only one true and known to both parties on January 15, would best serve the carpenter as the basis for a defense in an action brought against him by the homeowner for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"The carpenter's busy schedule permitted him to work on the homeowner's house only during the month of March.","Any delay in making the repairs would not seriously affect the homeowner's use of the property.","The cost of making repairs was increasing at the rate of 3 percent a month.","The area around the homeowner's property was frequently flooded during the month of March.",,,1,"A is correct. A party's performance under a contract may be excused on grounds of supervening impracticability where the performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the flood was an act of God that related to a basic assumption of the agreement to repair the homeowner's house, it operated to excuse any resulting delay in completing the requested work. Whether or not the delay was sufficiently severe to discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract depends on whether circumstances have so changed that performance will become materially more burdensome than the agreed-upon performance. The carpenter's busy schedule after March suggests that continued performance after the delay would be materially burdensome and thus his obligation should be completely discharged.

B and D are incorrect. Neither fact is relevant to whether the carpenter is justified in refusing to continue performance as of March 31. C is incorrect. This factor alone would not make a continued performance by the carpenter materially more burdensome.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A homeowner and a contractor entered into a contract for the construction of a home for $300,000. The contractor was to earn a profit of $10,000 for the job. After the contractor had spent $45,000 on labor and materials, including $5,000 on oak flooring not yet installed, the homeowner informed the contractor that the homeowner had lost his job and could not pay for any services. The homeowner told the contractor to stop working immediately. The reasonable market value of the labor and materials provided by the contractor at that point, including the oak flooring, was $40,000. The contractor used the oak flooring on another job. 

In an action by the contractor against the homeowner for damages, which of the following would be the largest amount of damages recoverable by the contractor?",multiple-choice,"$40,000, the reasonable value of the services the contractor had provided.","$40,000, the contractor's construction costs.","$50,000, the contractor's construction costs of $45,000 plus the $10,000 profit minus the $5,000 saved by reusing the oak flooring on another job.","$55,000, the contractor's construction costs of $45,000 plus the $10,000 profit.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. $50,000 represents the contractor's expectation measure of recovery and gives the contractor the benefit of the bargain-this amount would place the contractor in the position he would have been in but for the breach. It is also the greatest amount the contractor is able to recover. The general expectation formula permits the contractor to recover $50,000 and can be computed as follows:

General expectation formula = loss in value + other loss - cost avoided - loss avoided: 

LIV = the difference between the performance the nonbreaching party should have received under the contract and what was actually received, if anything, in this case, $300,000 less $0 


OL = consequential and incidental damages, if any, in this case, $0 


CA = the additional costs the nonbreaching party can avoid by rightfully discontinuing performance under the contract as a result of the other party's breach, in this case, $290,000 less $45,000


LA = the beneficial effects of the breach due to the nonbreaching party's ability to salvage or reallocate resources that otherwise would have been devoted to performing under the contract, in this case, $5,000


So $300,000 + $0 - $245,000 - $5,000 = $50,000. 

Answer A is incorrect. The $40,000 figure is an attempt to calculate the contractor's restitution recovery, measured by the benefit conferred on the owner, which will yield the smallest amount of recovery. The restitutionary measure would not allow the contractor to recover damages related to the benefit of the bargain. Circumstances are not present that would cause the contractor to seek damages based on the restitution principle and forgo his expectation measure of recovery. In addition, the $40,000 amount is incorrect as a restitution amount since it fails to deduct the $5,000 worth of oak flooring the contractor used on another job. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 371, 347.

Answer B is incorrect. $40,000 represents the contractor's reliance measure of recovery and fails to take into account the contractor's benefit of the bargain, the profit the contractor anticipated making on the project. Reliance damages are measured based on the contractor's unreimbursed expenses for labor and materials, $45,000, less the salvage value of the oak flooring, $5,000, which equals $40,000. Circumstances are not present that would cause the contractor to seek damages based on the reliance principle and forgo his expectation measure of recovery. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 349, 347.

Answer D is incorrect. A $55,000 damages recovery will place the contractor in a better position than he would have been in but for the breach because it fails to take into account the loss avoided--the beneficial effects of the breach due to the contractor's ability to salvage or reallocate resources that otherwise would have been devoted to performing under the contract. Here the loss avoided is the $5,000 worth of oak flooring that the contractor used on another job. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 347.",Remedies
"An insurance company issued an insurance policy to a homeowner. The policy failed to contain certain coverage terms required by a state insurance statute. When the homeowner suffered a loss due to a theft that was within the policy's terms, the insurance company refused to pay, claiming that the policy was unenforceable because it violated the statute. 

Will the homeowner likely succeed in an action against the insurance company to recover for the loss?",multiple-choice,"No, because the insurance policy is not a divisible contract.","No, because the insurance policy violated the statute.","Yes, because the homeowner belongs to the class of persons intended to be protected by the statute.","Yes, because the insurance policy would be strictly construed against the insurance company as the drafter.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A contract that violates a state statute may be declared unenforceable on grounds of public policy. Where, however, the contract violates a policy that was intended for the benefit of a contracting party seeking relief, the contract may be enforceable in order to avoid frustrating the policy behind the statute. Accordingly, public policy would not prevent the enforcement of the contract by those within the class of persons, including the homeowner, that the statute was intended to protect. Thus, Answer C is correct. 

Answer A is incorrect. The statement accurately states that the insurance policy is not a divisible contract. The doctrine of divisibility is typically employed to permit a breaching party who is to receive money under the contract to recover a portion of the contract price for having completed a portion of the work. The doctrine of divisibility is not relevant here, because the focus of this question is the enforceability of a contract entered into in violation of a statute. 

Answer B is incorrect. Generally, a contract that violates a regulatory statute may be unenforceable as against public policy if the policy against enforcement outweighs the interest of enforcement. This general rule is subject, however, to an exception when those intended to be protected by the statute would be harmed by a finding of unenforceability. In this case, public policy would not prevent enforcement of the contract by those within the class of persons, including the homeowner, that the statute was intended to protect. 

Answer D is incorrect. While as a general rule an insurance policy is interpreted against the drafter, this rule is primarily applicable in disputes involving the interpretation of contract language, which is not at issue in this question.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"Under the terms of a written contract, a builder agreed to construct for a homeowner a garage for $10,000. Nothing was said in the parties' negotiations or in the contract about progress payments during the course of the work.

After completing 25% of the garage strictly according to the homeowner's specifications, the builder assigned his rights under the contract to a bank as security for an $8,000 loan. The bank immediately notified the homeowner of the assignment. The builder thereafter, without legal excuse, abandoned the job before it was half-complete. The builder subsequently defaulted on the loan from the bank. The builder has no assets. It will cost the homeowner at least $8,000 to get the garage finished by another builder.

If the bank sues the homeowner for $8,000, which of the following will the court decide?",multiple-choice,"The bank wins, because the builder-homeowner contract was in existence and the builder was not in breach when the bank gave the homeowner notice of the assignment.","The bank wins, because the bank as a secured creditor over the builder is entitled to priority over the homeowner's unsecured claim against the builder.","The homeowner wins, because his right to recoupment on account of the builder's breach is available against the bank as the builder's assignee.","The homeowner wins, because his claim against the builder arose prior to the builder's default on his loan from the bank.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. When contract rights are assigned, the assignee acquires a right against the obligor only to the extent that the obligor is under a duty to the assignor. In other words, the assignee acquires no greater rights against the obligor than the assignor had. When the builder (assignor) assigned his contract right to the bank (assignee), the bank's right to payment remained subject to any defense that the homeowner (obligor) could raise against the builder. Therefore, the builder's material breach of the construction contract is a defense that the homeowner can raise against the bank.

Answer A is incorrect because the bank's rights remain vulnerable to any defense that the homeowner can raise, regardless of whether the facts giving rise to the defense occur after the assignment or after the bank gives notice of the assignment. Answer B is incorrect because the rights the bank acquired are subject to the same defenses that the builder's were. Answer D is incorrect because the bank's status as the builder's creditor is irrelevant to whether the homeowner can raise the defense of the builder's breach against the bank.","Third-Party Rights"
"A written contract was entered into between a financier-investor and a winery. The contract provided that the financier-investor would invest $1,000,000 in the winery for its capital expansion and, in return, that the winery, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it.

The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility.

A bank lent the financier-investor $200,000 and the financier-investor executed a written instrument providing that the bank ""is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the winery-investor contract."" The bank gave prompt notice of this transaction to the winery.

If the winery thereafter refused to account for any profits to the bank, and the bank sues the winery for the financier-investor's share of profits then realized, the winery's strongest argument in defense is that",multiple-choice,"the investor-winery contract did not expressly authorize an assignment of rights.","the financier-investor and the winery are partners, not simply debtor and creditor.","the bank is not an assignee of the financier-investor's rights under the investor-winery contract.","the bank is not an intended third-party beneficiary of the investor-winery contract.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The language of the financier-investor's promise may not be sufficient to assign its rights of payment from its contract with the winery. The language simply says the bank can collect to satisfy the financier-investor's debt to the bank ""from my share of the profits."" A is incorrect because contract rights are freely assignable. B is incorrect because if the agreement between the financier-investor and the winery were found to be a partnership agreement, partnership interests are assignable. D is incorrect because the bank need not qualify as a beneficiary under the first contract to acquire the financier-investor's right to profits under that agreement.","Third-Party Rights"

Builder, Inc., became insolvent and defaulted. Land, Inc., sued Boss individually for the breach, and at the trial Boss proffered evidence from the pre-contract negotiations that only Builder, Inc., was to be legally responsible for performing the contract.

If the court finds the contract to be completely integrated, is Boss's proffered evidence admissible?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the writing is ambiguous as to whether or not Boss was intended individually to be a contracting party.","Yes, because the evidence would contradict neither the recital nor the form of Boss's signature.","No, because the legal effect of Boss's signature cannot be altered by evidence of prior understandings.","No, because the application of the ""four corners"" rule, under which the meaning of a completely integrated contract must be ascertained solely from its own terms.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The parol evidence rule bars extrinsic evidence of statements made prior to the execution of a final written agreement where the statements contradict the terms of the final written agreement or where the statements purport to add to the agreement where the agreement is completely integrated (i.e., one that is intended by the parties to be both the final and exclusive manifestation of the parties' understanding). However, an exception to the parol evidence rule applies where the extrinsic evidence is offered to interpret an ambiguity in the final written agreement. Because the writing is ambiguous as to whether Boss signed the construction contract on her own behalf or only as representative of Builder, extrinsic evidence of the negotiations between Builder and Land is admissible to interpret the writing.

B is incorrect because, if the agreement were completely integrated, the evidence would be barred under the parol evidence rule regardless of whether there was a contradiction between the statement and the final writing. C and D are incorrect because the parol evidence rule will not bar the introduction of extrinsic evidence to interpret an ambiguity in the writing.","Contract Content and Meaning"
"A painter, who has been in the painting business for ten years and has a fine reputation, contracts to paint a farmer's barn. The farmer's barn is a standard red barn with a loft. The contract has no provision regarding assignment.

If the painter assigns the contract to a contractor, who has comparable experience and reputation, which of the following statements is correct?",multiple-choice,"The painter is in breach of contract.","The farmer may refuse to accept performance by the contractor.","The farmer is required to accept performance by the contractor.","There is a novation.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. An assignment is a transfer of rights under a contract. Generally, all contractual rights may be assigned unless the contract provides otherwise. A contractual right may be assigned to another unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Typically the other party will have a substantial interest if the contract is a personal services contract involving aesthetic taste and judgment. Although the painter-farmer contract is one for personal services (painting), the item to be painted is a standard barn and the work will be done by a painter of comparable experience and reputation. A delegation, on the other hand, is the transfer of duties under a contract. In this case, because the painter assigned the entire contract, there was both an assignment and delegation of duties. There are no special formalities for an effective delegation. The delegator must only manifest a present intention to make the delegation. Therefore, the painter's delegation of the duty was not a breach, even if it was done without the consent of the farmer. If the farmer refuses performance by the contractor, he will be in breach of contract.

A and B are thus incorrect. D is incorrect because the mere delegation of a duty, does not create a novation; a novation would require an express agreement by all parties to substitute the contractor for the painter.","Third-Party Rights"
"In a telephone call on March 1, an unemployed retired man said to a purchaser, ""I will sell my automobile for $3,000 cash. I will hold this offer open through March 14."" On March 12, the man called the purchaser and told her that he had sold the automobile to a friend. The man in fact had not sold the automobile to anyone. On March 14, the purchaser learned that the man still owned the automobile and on that date called the man and said, ""I'm coming over to your place with $3,000."" The man replied, ""Don't bother, I won't deliver the automobile to you under any circumstances."" The purchaser protested, but made no further attempt to pay for or take delivery of the automobile.

In an action by the purchaser against the man for breach of contract, the purchaser probably will",multiple-choice,"succeed, because the man had assured her that the offer would remain open through March 14.","succeed, because the man had not in fact sold the automobile to the friend.","not succeed, because the purchaser had not tendered the $3,000 to the man on or before March 14.","not succeed, because on March 12 the man had told the purchaser that he had sold the automobile to the friend.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Unless an option contract is created, the offeror retains the power to revoke an offer at any time prior to acceptance. In order to create an option, the offeror must manifest an intent not to revoke the offer during the time stated, and the option promise must be supported by consideration. The promise that the man made to the purchaser on March 1 was not an option promise because it was not supported by consideration. Furthermore, the offer is not preserved by the UCC's firm offer rule because the man was not a merchant and the offer was not a signed writing. Therefore, the man's March 12 statement that the car had been sold was effective as a revocation, even though untrue, because it manifested the man's intention not to enter into the contract, and the revocation was made prior to the purchaser's attempted acceptance.

A is incorrect because the man's assurance that the offer would remain open is not sufficient to limit his right to revoke. B is incorrect because what matters for the revocation to be effective is that it must manifest an intent not to enter into the contract. C is incorrect because this offer was for a bilateral contract, which could have been accepted by the purchaser's promise to pay. Actual payment by March 14th was not a condition of the contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"A lumber supplier agreed to sell to a furniture manufacturer all the lumber that the manufacturer required over a two-year period. The sales contract provided that payment was due 60 days after delivery, but that a 3% discount would be allowed if the manufacturer paid within 10 days of delivery. During the first year of the contract, the manufacturer regularly paid within the 10-day period and received the 3% discount. Fifteen days after the supplier had made its most recent lumber delivery to the manufacturer, the supplier had received no payment from the manufacturer. At this time, the supplier became aware of rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was precarious. The supplier called the manufacturer, demanding assurances regarding the manufacturer's financial status. The manufacturer immediately mailed to the supplier its latest audited financial statements as well as a satisfactory credit report prepared by the manufacturer's banker. The rumors proved to be false. Nevertheless, the supplier refused to resume deliveries. The manufacturer has sued the supplier for breach of contract. 

Will the manufacturer likely prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because the contract was unenforceable, since the manufacturer had not committed to purchase a definite quantity of lumber.","No, because the supplier had reasonable grounds for insecurity and was therefore entitled to cancel the contract and refuse to make any future deliveries.","Yes, because the credit report and audited financial statements provided adequate assurance of due performance under the contract.","Yes, because the supplier was not entitled to condition resumption of deliveries on the receipt of financial status information.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A party to a contract with reasonable grounds to worry that the other party might not perform can request adequate assurances of performance, pursuant to Uniform Commercial Code § 2-609. The supplier in this case did so, but the information provided by the manufacturer would be regarded as satisfying the request for an assurance of performance. Therefore the supplier's refusal to continue performance constituted a breach of contract for which the manufacturer is entitled to compensation.

Answer A is incorrect. A quantity term expressed in terms of a manufacturer's requirements is enforceable. Uniform Commercial Code § 2-306 provides that ""a term which measures the quantity by the . . . requirements of the buyer means such actual . . . requirements as may occur in good faith . . . ."" Essentially, the definiteness of quantity requirement is satisfied if there is an available objective method for determining the quantity, and the requirements of a manufacturer would generally satisfy that need. In this case, once the manufacturer provided the supplier with adequate assurance in the form of audited financial statements and a credit report, the supplier was bound to perform under the contract. 

Answer B is incorrect. Under Uniform Commercial Code § 2-609, a party to a contract who has reasonable grounds for insecurity is entitled to request assurances, and is also entitled to suspend performance pending receipt of that assurance. A failure to provide an adequate assurance within a reasonable time (not to exceed 30 days) can be treated as a repudiation, which may give rise to a right to terminate the contract. In this case, the supplier was entitled to seek assurance, but once the manufacturer provided the supplier with adequate assurance in the form of audited financial statements and a credit report, the supplier was bound to perform under the contract. 

Answer D is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the manufacturer will prevail, but it misstates the reason why this is so. Uniform Commercial Code § 2-609 provides that a party to a contract with reasonable grounds to worry that the other party might not perform can request adequate assurance of performance. In this case, the supplier heard rumors from a credible source that the manufacturer's financial condition was insecure. This would be enough to trigger the right to request assurance, and so it is incorrect to assert that the supplier was not entitled to request assurance. Nevertheless, the manufacturer will prevail because it in fact provided adequate assurance in the form of audited financial statements and a credit report. Therefore the supplier's refusal to continue performance constituted a breach of contract for which the manufacturer is entitled to compensation.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A burglar stole a collector's impressionist painting valued at $400,000. The collector, who had insured the painting for $300,000 with an insurance company, promised to pay $25,000 to a full-time investigator for the insurance company if he effected the return of the painting to her in good condition. By company rules, the insurance company permits its investigators to accept and retain rewards from policyholders for the recovery of insured property. The investigator, by long and skillful detective work, recovered the picture and returned it undamaged to the collector.

If the collector refuses to pay the investigator anything, and he sues her for $25,000, what is the probable result under the prevailing modern rule?",multiple-choice,"The collector wins, because the investigator owed the insurance company a preexisting duty to recover the picture if possible.","The collector wins, because the insurance company, the investigator's employer, had a preexisting duty to return the recovered painting to the collector.","The investigator wins, because the collector will benefit more from return of the $400,000 painting than from receiving the $300,000 policy proceeds.","The investigator wins, because the preexisting duty rule does not apply if the promisee's (the investigator's) duty was owed to a third person.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Traditionally, when a preexisting duty was owed to a third party, a new promise to perform the same duty would not constitute consideration. However, under the prevailing modern rule, the new promise will constitute consideration when the original promise was owed to a third party. Therefore the investigator's performance of effecting the return of the painting to the collector was sufficient consideration to support her promise to pay the investigator $25,000 because the preexisting duty was owed to the insurance company and not to the collector.

A is incorrect because the rule does not apply when the duty is owed to a third person. B is incorrect because the fact that the insurance company is also obligated is not relevant to whether the investigator furnished sufficient consideration. C is incorrect because the extent to which the collector will benefit is not relevant to whether the investigator furnished sufficient consideration.","Formation of Contracts"
"An accountant and a bookkeeper, as part of a contract dissolving their accounting business, agreed that each would contribute $100,000 to fund an annuity for a clerk who was a longtime employee of the business. The clerk's position would be terminated at the dissolution, and he did not have a retirement plan. The accountant and the bookkeeper informed the clerk of their plan to fund an annuity for him. The clerk, confident about his financial future because of the promised annuity, purchased a retirement home. The accountant later contributed his $100,000 to fund the annuity, but the bookkeeper stated that he could afford to contribute only $50,000. The accountant agreed in writing that the bookkeeper should contribute only $50,000. 

Does the clerk have a valid basis for an action against the bookkeeper for the unpaid $50,000?",multiple-choice,"No, because the clerk was bound by the modification of the contract made by the accountant and the bookkeeper.","No, because the clerk was only a donee beneficiary of the contract between the accountant and the bookkeeper and had no vested rights.","Yes, because the clerk's reliance on the promised annuity prevented the parties from changing the terms of the contract.","Yes, because the promise to establish the annuity was made binding by consideration from the clerk's many years of employment.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Generally, parties who contract to confer a benefit on an intended beneficiary retain the right to modify their duties by subsequent agreement. The power to modify is terminated, however, when the intended beneficiary materially changes his position in reliance on the promise. The clerk was an intended beneficiary of the contract between the accountant and the bookkeeper, because their promise to fund the annuity was clearly intended to benefit the clerk. The clerk materially changed his position in reliance on the promise when he purchased a retirement home. The clerk's material reliance terminated the ability of the accountant and the bookkeeper to modify their respective duties. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 302, 311. Thus, Answer C is correct, and Answers A and B are incorrect. 

Answer D is incorrect. Under the bargained-for-exchange test for consideration, acts performed in the past constitute past consideration, which does not amount to the consideration required to enforce a contract. The clerk's many years of employment constituted past consideration and would be insufficient to prevent the accountant and the bookkeeper from modifying their duties regarding the promise to fund the annuity except for the clerk's subsequent reliance on their promise.

Which of the following statements is most accurate with respect to the breach of contract claim against the janitorial service?",multiple-choice,"The janitorial service is liable to the patient as a matter of public policy, because it violated the city's health code.","The patient is an intended third-party beneficiary under the contract, because the janitorial service's promise was intended to benefit all hospital patients.","The patient has no claim for breach of contract against the janitorial service, because she is an incidental beneficiary.","The patient cannot sue on the contract, because she was not named in the contract.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The patient cannot recover because she is an incidental beneficiary rather than an intended third-party beneficiary. Here, the circumstances fail to indicate that the hospital intended to give the patient the benefit of the promised performance. Thus, Answer C is correct and Answer B is incorrect.

Answer A is incorrect. A violation of public policy may render a contract unenforceable. Here, however, the patient's ability to recover against the janitorial service will be governed by a third-party beneficiary theory, under which she would be an incidental beneficiary and therefore not eligible to recover damages.

Answer D is incorrect. An intended third-party beneficiary acquires rights under a contract whether or not the party is identified as an intended beneficiary at the time the contract is made. In this case, however, the patient is an incidental beneficiary rather than an intended third-party beneficiary, and therefore she cannot recover on a breach of contract claim.","Third-Party Rights"
"A father had made a legally binding promise to furnish his son and his son's fiancé a house on their wedding day, planned for June 10, 2002. Pursuant to that promise, the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on May 1, 2001, and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof:

The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by the father, and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $18,000. The father agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1, 2001, upon monthly presentation of a certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met.

The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001, when he also began building the house. The father made three $2,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September 2001, without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 2001, to the end of February 2002, because of bad weather, and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1, 2002, the contractor demanded payment of $2,000; but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate. The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.

Assuming that the contractor committed a total breach on March 1, 2002, and assuming further that he was aware when the agreement was made of the purpose for which the father wanted the completed house, which of the following, if true, would best support the father's claim for consequential damages on account of delay beyond June 10, 2002, in getting the house finished?",multiple-choice,"The son and his bride, married on June 10, 2002, would have to pay storage charges on their wedding gifts and new furniture until the house could be completed.","The son's fiancé jilted the son on June 10, 2002, and ran off with another man who had a new house.","The father was put to additional expense in providing his son and the son's bride, married on June 10, 2002, with temporary housing.","On June 10, 2002, the father paid a $5,000 judgment obtained against him in a suit filed March 15, 2002, by an adjoining landowner on account of the father's negligent excavation, including blasting, in an attempt to finish the house himself after the contractor's repudiation.",,,3,"C is correct. In addition to direct expectation recovery, the father would be entitled to damages for consequential loss because the contractor knew of the special circumstances for which the house was being built and the deadline giving rise to these damages for delay.

A is incorrect. The father's promise was to furnish the son and the son's wife a home on their wedding day. His consequential damages would be limited to further losses to him, which were dependent upon the contract. His legally binding agreement with the son and the son's fiancé would give rise to direct liability for their damages, but not his agreement with the contractor.

B is incorrect. This incident is not a consequence of or caused by the contractor's breach or reasonably foreseeable as a result of the contractor's breach.

D is incorrect. The father's negligent attempt at mitigation to prevent consequential loss is not compensable because the father did not act reasonably in choosing self-help as substitute performance.",Remedies
"A seller entered into an agreement to sell a machine to a buyer for $5,000. At the time of the order, the buyer gave the seller a down payment of $1,000. The buyer then built a foundation for the machine at a cost of $250. The seller failed to deliver the machine. The buyer made reasonable efforts to find a similar machine and bought one for $5,500 that did not fit on the foundation. The buyer sued the seller for breach of contract.

The protection of the restitutionary interest restores to a party any benefit conferred to the other party. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 344(c). Under UCC § 2-711(3), on a rightful rejection, a buyer is entitled to a return of any payments made on the goods. Thus Answer C is correct, and Answer D is incorrect.

The $250 cost of the foundation conferred no benefit on the seller and would constitute a component of the buyer's expectation measure rather than a restitutionary measure of recovery. In this case, however, the buyer would be entitled to return of the down payment as restitution. Thus, Answer A is incorrect.

If the seller sues the buyer for breach of contract, is the court likely to find the buyer in breach?",multiple-choice,"No, because the buyer's performance was subject to a condition that did not occur.","No, because the promise was illusory since the buyer was not obligated to do anything.","Yes, because a promise was implied that the buyer had to make reasonable efforts to obtain mortgage financing.","Yes, because a reasonable interpretation of the agreement is that the buyer had an obligation to purchase the house for $250,000 in 30 days.",,,3,"A is incorrect. A performance that is subject to an express condition cannot become due unless the condition occurs or its non-occurrence is excused.

"On November 1, the following notice was posted in a privately-operated law school:

The faculty, seeking to encourage legal research, offers to any student at this school who wins the current National Obscenity Law Competition the additional prize of $500. All competing papers must be submitted to the Dean's office before May 1.
A student read this notice on November 2, and thereupon intensified his effort to make his paper on obscenity law, which he started in October, a winner. The student also left on a counter in the Dean's office a signed note saying, ""I accept the faculty's $500 Obscenity Competition offer."" This note was inadvertently placed in a student's file and never reached the Dean or any faculty member personally. On the following April 1, the above notice was removed and the following substituted therefore:

The faculty regrets that our offer regarding the National Obscenity Law Competition must be withdrawn.
The student's paper was submitted through the Dean's office on April 15. On May 1, it was announced that the student had won the National Obscenity Law Competition and the prize of $1,000. The law faculty refused to pay anything.

An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter a bargain, which is made in such a way that the offeree is justified in thinking that her assent will conclude a bargain. Advertisements or announcements directed to the public at large typically are construed as invitations to deal and not as offers, in part out of concern that an open-ended offer to the public would expose the offeror to excessive liability. This rationale will not apply, however, if the language in the announcement is qualified with limiting language such as ""first come first served."" Because the faculty's $500 offer was limited to the winner of the competition, the public posting of the faculty's notice may reasonably be construed to be an offer.

A and C are incorrect because, as explained above, an advertisement or announcement may be construed as an offer where the language of the offer is sufficiently definite.

The daughter's uncle, who was present on this occasion, read the memorandum and thereupon said to the daughter, ""and if she doesn't pay your expenses, I will.""

The executor of the woman's estate has refused to pay her anything for the two ""A's"" and has told her that the estate will no longer pay her tuition, room, and board in law school.

Under the Statute of Frauds, promises made to answer for the debt of another generally fall within the suretyship clause of the statute and therefore must meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute. The uncle's promise to the daughter falls within the suretyship provision of the statute, since it is a promise by the uncle to the daughter to answer for the debt of the woman. Because the promise was oral, it did not meet the writing and signing requirements of the statute and therefore is not enforceable.

A is incorrect because the parties' statements do manifest an intent to contract. B is incorrect because, although the woman's death cut off the daughter's power to accept the woman's offer, it does not affect the enforceability of the uncle's promise.

Where one party's performance is to take place over a period of time, that party must complete its performance before the other party is required to perform, unless the language or circumstances indicate otherwise.

Answer A is incorrect. The homeowner is not in breach. As stated above, his duty to perform has not become due since the builder has not completed its performance.

"A builder borrowed $10,000 from a lender to finance a small construction job under a contract with a homeowner. The builder gave the lender a writing that stated, ""Any money I receive from the homeowner will be paid immediately to the lender, regardless of any demands from other creditors."" The builder died after completing the job but before the homeowner paid. The lender demanded that the homeowner pay the $10,000 due to the builder directly to the lender. The homeowner refused, saying that he would pay directly to the builder's estate everything that he owed the builder.

C is incorrect. It may have been the builder's subjective intent to have the homeowner pay the $10,000 directly to the lender if the builder died, but more was required in order for the lender to have the right to receive that direct payment.

"On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of programs for the department store's computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety:

The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store's Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing.
On June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After the department store denied liability, the parties orally agreed that the department store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by the computer programming company and the department store's computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the department store's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would, however, save the department store $12,000 a year. Further, if the department store would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by the computer programming company, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent, saving the department store another $8,000 a year.

The department store's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.

Assume that the computer programming company was in breach of contract because of its four-day delay in completion and that an express condition precedent to the department store's duty to pay the contract price has failed. Can the computer programming company nevertheless recover the reasonable value of its service?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because continued use of the programs by the department store would save at least $12,000 a year.","Yes, because the department store was continuing to use programs created by the computer programming company for which, as the department store knew, the computer programming company expected to be paid.","No, because failure of an express condition precedent excused the department store from any duty to compensate the computer programming company.","No, because such a recovery by the computer programming company would be inconsistent with a claim by the department store against the computer programming company for breach of contract.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The fact pattern stipulates that the computer programming company did not fulfill an express condition to the contract due to its four-day delay, so the department store's contractual duties were discharged. However, a breaching party can recover the reasonable value of a benefit conferred onto the non-breaching party via a quasi-contract action if: (1) the plaintiff has conferred a benefit on the defendant, (2) the plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of being paid, (3) the benefits were conferred at the request of the defendant, and (4) the defendant would be unjustly enriched if it retained the benefits without compensation. Here, the department store continued using the program, which saved the store $12,000 a year due to shortened processing time. This is a benefit which was conferred at the request of the department store and for which the computer programming company expected to be paid. Furthermore, the department store would be unjustly enriched ($12,000 a year) if allowed to use the program without compensating the computer programming company. Therefore, the computer programming company will be able to recover the reasonable value of its service.

A is incorrect because simply conferring a benefit is not sufficient to allow for a recovery by the programming company. C is incorrect because even though the contract has been held unenforceable, an equitable quasi-contract remedy will allow for recovery. D is incorrect because the recovery by the computer programming company is provided under a quasi-contract action which does not require a contractual relationship between the parties.

The foregoing was telecast by the city's sole television station once daily for one week. Subsequently, the store, by a written memorandum to a private detective, proposed to pay the detective $200 ""for each day's work you actually perform in investigating our fire."" Thereafter in August, 2007, the City Council by resolution repealed its reward offer and caused this resolution to be broadcast once daily for a week over two local radio stations, the local television station having meanwhile ceased operations. In September, 2007, an employee of the store voluntarily confessed to the detective to having committed all of the 2006 arsons. The store's president thereupon paid the detective at the proposed daily rate for his investigation and suggested that the detective also claim the city's reward, of which the detective had been previously unaware. The detective immediately made the claim. In December, 2007, as a result of the detective's investigation, the store's employee was convicted of burning the store.

Therefore, the phrase will be given its ordinary meaning, that the payment will be received within one month after completion of the project. 

A and B are incorrect. Both improperly rely on a technical reading of the contract language. C is incorrect. Courts will read a constructive condition precedent regarding timing into the contract when one performance will take a period of time to complete while the other can be completed in an instant. In such a case, the court will make the completion of the longer performance a constructive condition precedent to the execution of the shorter performance.

Further, under a ""liquidated damages"" clause in the agreement, the builder promised to pay the landowner $500 for each day's delay in completing the house after the following October 1.

The landowner, however, refused to pay any part of the final installment after the architect told him that the builder ""did a great job and I find no defects worth mentioning; but the builder's contract price was at least $40,000 too high, especially in view of the big drop in housing values within the past ten months.

It was not withheld because the house did not meet specifications, but rather to induce the builder to lower her fee because the housing market had fallen during the ten-month period during which the builder was performing under the contract.

B is incorrect. The condition is excused; the builder is entitled to her expectation recovery under the contract, the final $40,000 payment, and not an equitable theory of recovery.

C is incorrect. The present fair market value is not relevant to the certificate of approval, which is based upon compliance with the architect's specifications and completion of the construction in a workmanlike manner.

D is incorrect. The parties' agreement is enforceable as to the price to be paid for the house.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"In a writing signed by both parties on December 1, a man agreed to buy from a distributor a gasoline engine for $1,000, delivery to be made on the following February 1. Through a secretarial error, the writing called for delivery on March 1, but neither party noticed the error until February 1. Before signing the agreement, the man and the distributor orally agreed that the contract of sale would be effective only if the man notified the distributor in writing no later than January 2 that the man had arranged to resell the engine to a third person. Otherwise, they agreed orally, ""There is no deal."" On December 15, the man entered into a contract with a mechanic to resell the engine to the mechanic at a profit.

The man did not give the distributor notice of the resale until January 25, and the distributor received it by mail on January 26. In the meantime, the value of the engine had unexpectedly increased about 75% since December 1, and the distributor renounced the agreement.

If the man sues distributor on February 2 for breach of contract, which of the following is the distributor's best defense?",multiple-choice,"The secretarial error in the written delivery-term was a mutual mistake concerning a basic fact, and the agreement is voidable by either party.","The man's not giving written notice by January 2 of his resale was a failure of a condition precedent to the existence of a contract.","In view of the unexpected 75% increase in value of the engine after December 1, the distributor's performance is excused by the doctrine of commercial frustration.","The agreement, if any, is unenforceable because a material term was not included in the writing.",,,2,"B is correct. A condition is an event that is not certain to occur, which must occur, unless excused, before performance under a contract becomes due. The man and the distributor agreed that each party's obligation under the contract of sale was expressly conditioned upon the man giving written notice of resale to the distributor on or before January 2. Since such notice was not given until January 26, any obligation that the distributor undertook under the contract of sale was excused due to the nonoccurrence of the condition.

A is incorrect. The facts do not suggest that the delivery date relates to a basic assumption of the contract, and therefore the contract does not appear to be voidable on grounds of mistake. C is incorrect. Even a dramatic increase in the value of the gasoline engine would not provide a basis for excuse on grounds of frustration (in any event, frustration of purpose is a defense available to buyers rather than sellers). D is incorrect. A writing may be enforceable even if it omits a material term.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"The manager of a state fair contracted with a renowned hog breeder to exhibit the breeder's world champion animal for the three weeks of the annual fair, at the conclusion of which the breeder would receive an honorarium of $300. Two days before the opening of the fair, the champion animal took sick with boarsitis, a communicable disease among swine, and, under the applicable state quarantine law, very probably could not be exhibited for at least a month.

Upon learning this, the manager can legally pursue which of the following courses of action with respect to his contract with the breeder?",multiple-choice,"Suspend his own performance, demand assurances from the breeder, and treat a failure by the breeder to give them as an actionable repudiation.","Suspend his own performance and recover damages from the breeder for breach of contract unless the breeder at once supplies an undiseased hog of exhibition quality as a substitute for the champion animal.","Terminate his own performance and treat the animal's illness as discharging all remaining duties under the contract.","Terminate the contract, but only if he (the manager) seeks promptly to obtain for the exhibit a suitable substitute for the champion animal from another hog owner.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. A contract may be rescinded on grounds of supervening impracticability where a party's performance is made impracticable without his fault due to the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. Such event may include the destruction or deterioration of a specific thing necessary for the performance of a duty or the necessity to comply with a governmental order. Because the breeder undertook to exhibit his world champion animal(and not any other hog), the animal's availability for exhibition is a basic assumption of the contract. The animal's illness, which requires him to be quarantined for a month under state law, renders the breeder's performance impracticable. Therefore the manager should treat both parties' obligations under the contract as discharged.

A, B and D are incorrect because the animal's illness provides a basis for excuse of the breeder's obligation. Specifically, as explained above, the breeder is not obligated to provide a substitute hog because the contract only contemplated exhibiting the champion animal.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"An experienced rancher contracted to harvest his neighbor's wheat crop for $1,000 ""when the crop [was] ripe."" In early September, the neighbor told the rancher that the crop was ripe. The rancher delayed because he had other customers to attend to. The neighbor was concerned that the delay might cause the crop to be lost, for hailstorms were common in that part of the country in the fall. In fact, in early October, before the crop was harvested, it was destroyed by a hailstorm.

Is the rancher liable for the loss?",multiple-choice,"No, because no time for performance was established in the contract.","No, because the neighbor failed to tell the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm.","Yes, because at the time the contract was made, the rancher had reason to foresee the loss as a probable result of his breach.","Yes, because a party who undertakes a contractual obligation is liable for all the consequences that flow from his breach.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The rules of contract law limit the recoverability of damages for a breach of contract. According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 351, a non-breaching party is entitled to recover damages that the party in breach ""had reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach"" when the parties entered into the contract. Reason to foresee can arise from circumstances that result in the breaching party having had actual or constructive knowledge of the loss that might result from the breach. Therefore, the neighbor's failure to specifically inform the rancher that the crop might be destroyed by a hailstorm does not determine whether the loss was foreseeable. Thus, Answer B is incorrect. In this case, the rancher's experience and the frequency of hailstorms in the fall combined to make the loss resulting from the rancher's breach foreseeable. Thus, Answer C is correct.

Answer D is incorrect because, even though it states the correct result, it provides the wrong rationale. A party that breaches a contract is liable only for damages that were foreseeable as the probable result of the breach when the parties entered into the contract.

Answer A is incorrect. The language in the contract tying the rancher's performance to when the crop was ripe was sufficient to establish the time of the rancher's performance. The rancher will be liable for the loss because such a loss was foreseeable, given the rancher's experience and the frequency of hailstorms in the fall.",Remedies
"On October 1, a toy store entered into a written contract with a toy factory for the purchase at $20 per unit of 1,000 mechanical dogs, to be specially manufactured by the factory according to the store's specifications. The factory promised to deliver all of the dogs ""not later than November 15, for the Yule shopping season,"" and the store promised to pay the full $20,000 price upon delivery. In order to obtain operating funds, the factory as borrower entered into a written loan agreement on October 5 with a finance company. In relevant part, this agreement recited, ""[the factory] hereby transfers and assigns to [the finance company] its [the factory's] October 1 mechanical dog contract with [the store], as security for a 50-day loan of $15,000, the advance and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged by [the factory]. . ."" No copy of this agreement, or statement relating to it, was filed in an office of public record.

On October 15, the factory notified the store, ""We regret to advise that our master shaft burned out last night because our night supervisor let the lubricant level get too low. We have just fired the supervisor, but the shaft cannot be repaired or replaced until about January 1. We can guarantee delivery of your order, however, not later than January 20."" The store rejected this proposal as unacceptable and immediately contracted with the only other available manufacturer to obtain the 1,000 dogs at $30 per unit by November 15.

By November 16, the factory, without legal excuse, has delivered no dogs, and the store has brought an action against the factory. In an action brought on November 16 by the store against the finance company on account of the factory's default, the store can recover",multiple-choice,"nothing, because the October 5 assignment by the factory to the finance company of the factory's contract was only an assignment for security.","nothing, because no record of the October 5 transaction between the factory and the finance company was publicly filed.","$10,000 damages, because the store was a third-party intended beneficiary of the October 5 transaction between the factory and the finance company.","$10,000 in damages, because the October 5 transaction between the factory and the finance company effected, with respect to the store as creditor, a novation of debtors.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The factory's assignment to the finance company was made to secure a loan and, as such, was an assignment of payment rights, not a delegation of duties. The assignment was also made conditional upon the factory not paying its $15,000 loan with the finance company within 50 days. The 50-day time for repayment had not passed on November 16 when the lawsuit was filed, the factory was not in default, and the finance company had not yet assumed any rights under this agreement.

B is incorrect because a public filing is not required for a valid assignment. Notice to the obligor (the store) is required. Pursuant to Article 9 of the UCC, a security interest may be perfected by filing. The failure to file would potentially affect the security agreement between the factory and the finance company. C is incorrect because the store was not intended to benefit from the agreement between the factory and the finance company. The agreement was for the benefit of the factory. D is incorrect because a novation is a contract under which an existing duty is discharged and a completely new duty is substituted. The finance company was not substituted for the factory as the debtor. The finance company was instead given a contingent right to collect payment from the store.","Third-Party Rights"
"A debtor's $1,000 contractual obligation to a creditor was due on July 1. On the preceding June 15, the creditor called her niece and said, ""As my birthday gift to you, you may collect on July 1 the $1,000 the debtor owes me."" The creditor also called the debtor and told him to pay the $1,000 to the niece on July 1. On July 1, the debtor, saying that he did not like the niece and wouldn't pay anything to her, paid the $1,000 to the creditor, who accepted it without objection.

Will the niece succeed in an action for $1,000 against the debtor?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the creditor had effectively assigned the $1,000 debt to her.","Yes, because the creditor's calls to the niece and the debtor effected a novation.","No, because the creditor's acceptance of the $1,000, without objection, was in effect the revocation of a gratuitous assignment.","No, because the debtor cannot be compelled to render performance to an assignee whom he finds personally objectionable.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Although contract rights generally are freely assignable, when a contract right is assigned to a party gratuitously (i.e., without receiving anything in exchange), the assignor retains the power to revoke the assignment unless and until the assignee obtains performance from the obligor. On June 15, the creditor made a gratuitous assignment to the niece of her right to collect $1,000 from the debtor. Because the assignment was a gift, the creditor retained the power to revoke the assignment, which she did when she accepted without objection the $1,000 payment from the debtor.

A is incorrect because the assignment was revocable. B is incorrect because a novation did not occur on these facts. D is incorrect because contract rights are freely assignable except in very limited circumstances, such as where assignment would materially change the duty of the obligor.","Third-Party Rights"
"A written contract was entered into between a financier-investor and a winery. The contract provided that the financier-investor would invest $1,000,000 in the winery for its capital expansion and, in return, that the winery, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it.

The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility.

If the winery refuses to distribute the wine through the wholesale distributor and the wholesale distributor then sues the winery for breach of contract, is it likely that the wholesale distributor will prevail?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the winery's performance was to run to the wholesale distributor rather than to the financier-investor.","Yes, because the financier-investor and the winery could reasonably foresee that the wholesale distributor would change his position in reliance on the contract.","No, because the financier-investor and the winery did not expressly agree that the wholesale distributor would have enforceable rights under their contract.","No, because the financier-investor and the winery, having no apparent motive to benefit the wholesale distributor, appeared in making the contract to have been protecting or serving only their own interests.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Although the wholesale distributor is specifically named in the contract, the language of the contract indicates performance is to be given to the financier-investor. Therefore, the wholesale distributor is not an intended beneficiary of the contract. Since the wholesale distributor is only an incidental beneficiary, it cannot sue to enforce the contract. The language of the contract also expresses no intent to vest an independent right of enforcement in the wholesale distributor: ""if feasible, the wine would be distributed ... only through the wholesale distributor.""

A is incorrect because the winery's performance runs to the financier-investor as the winery agreed to produce and market 500,000 bottles of wine annually. B is incorrect because the wholesale distributor is only an incidental beneficiary so materially changing its position based on the contract will not vest a right of enforcement. C is incorrect because a third party beneficiary may obtain vested rights without express language regarding enforcement if that third party is an intended third-party beneficiary.","Third-Party Rights"
"The aged mother of a sister and brother, both adults, wished to employ a live-in companion so that she might continue to live in her own home. The mother, however, had only enough income to pay one-half of the companion's $2,000 monthly salary. Learning of their mother's plight, the sister and brother agreed with each other in a signed writing that on the last day of January and each succeeding month during their mother's lifetime, each would give their mother $500. Their mother then hired the companion.

The siblings made the agreed payments in January, February, and March. In April, however, the brother refused to make any payment and notified his sister and their mother that he would make no further payments.

There is a valid contract between the siblings, but their mother has declined to sue the brother.

Will the sister succeed in an action against the brother in which she asks the court to order the brother to continue to make his payments to their mother under the terms of the the sibling's contract?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the sister's remedy at law is inadequate.","Yes, because the sister's burden of supporting her mother will be increased if her brother does not contribute his share.","No, because a court will not grant specific performance of a promise to pay money.","No, because the brother's breach of contract has caused no economic harm to the sister.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. A court may grant specific performance of a contractual obligation where an award of monetary damages is inadequate - in other words, where damages would not be a just or reasonable substitute for performance of the promise, or where calculation of adequate damages would be impracticable. Here the calculation of adequate damages would be impracticable because it is impossible to know how many months the mother will live. Therefore, the sister should be entitled to specific performance. 

B is incorrect because the brother's breach does not impose a legal duty on the sister to pay the difference. C is incorrect as a misstatement of the law; the court will not grant specific performance of service contracts, but the promise to pay money is not a service contract. D is incorrect because the absence of economic harm to the sister does not preclude recovery for breach of contract.",Remedies
"A new business enterprise about to commence the manufacture of clothing, entered into a written agreement to purchase all of its monthly requirements of a certain elasticized fabric for a period of three years from a fabric company at a specified unit price, and agreed upon delivery and payment terms. The agreement also provided:
1. The parties covenant not to assign this contract.

2. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company.
The fabric company promptly made an ""assignment of the contract"" to a finance company as security for a $100,000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered, took delivery of, and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5,000) for the new enterprise's requirement of the fabric for the first month of its operation.

Assume that the assignment from the fabric company to the finance company was effective, and that the creditor did not become aware of the original agreement between the new business enterprise and the fabric company until after the fabric company's acceptance of the $5,000 payment from the new business enterprise.

The creditor was not an incidental beneficiary of the new business enterprise-fabric company agreement because an incidental beneficiary is one who fortuitously and incidentally anticipates a benefit resulting from a transaction between others. Pursuant to the express language of the agreement, payments were to be made directly to the creditor for two months, rendering payment not fortuitous, but deliberately contemplated by the agreement. The creditor does not have a prior right to the new business enterprise's $5,000 payment as against either the fabric company or the finance company because although the creditor is an intended creditor beneficiary of the fabric company, it had no knowledge of its rights under the contract. Without knowledge, there could be no justifiable reliance or assent, so the right to payment under the contract had not vested.

The UCC rejects the common-law mirror image rule. Under the UCC, a written acceptance of a contract for the sale of goods generally will operate as such even if it states additional or different terms. The additional or different terms, however, will not become part of the contract if they materially alter the contract, unless the offeror expressly agrees to such term. The potential buyer's June 5th letter operated as an acceptance of the vendor's offer, but proposed a later payment date. Because the vendor expressly rejected this proposed term, it did not form part of the contract. Therefore, the potential buyer's June 9th communication operated as a repudiation of an existing agreement to buy 100 QT's.

A is incorrect because the vendor's June 2nd communication manifests an intent to make an offer. B is incorrect because the UCC rejects the common-law mirror image rule (which finds communications that vary the terms of an offer to be a counteroffer and not an acceptance). C is incorrect because in this case the mail box rule is irrelevant to whether a contract was formed, because the potential buyer's acceptance was received before any attempted revocation.","Formation of Contracts"
"A written contract was entered into between a financier-investor and a winery. The contract provided that the financier-investor would invest $1,000,000 in the winery for its capital expansion and, in return, that the winery, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under a label with the financier's name on it. The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by the winery only through a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither the financier-investor nor the winery had previously dealt with this wholesale distributor. The wholesale distributor learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. Soon after making its contract with the financier-investor, the winery, without the financier-investor's knowledge or assent, sold its vineyards but not its winery to a large agricultural corporation. Under the terms of this sale, the agricultural corporation agreed to sell to the winery all grapes grown on the land for five years. The agricultural corporation's employees have no experience in winegrape production, and the agricultural corporation has no reputation in the wine industry as a grape producer or otherwise. The investor-winery contract was silent on the matter of the winery selling any or all of its business assets. If the<b> financier-investor seeks an appropriate judicial remedy against the winery </b>for entering into the winery-agricultural corporation transaction, is the financier-investor likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the winery-agricultural corporation transaction created a significant risk of diminishing the profits in which the financier-investor would share under his contract with the winery.","Yes, because the investor-winery contract did not contain a provision authorizing a delegation of the winery's duties.","No, because the winery remains in a position to perform under the investor-winery contract.","No, because the winery, as a corporation, must necessarily perform its contracts by delegating duties to individuals.",,,1,"A is correct. The financier-investor relied upon the fact that the winery was famous for its vineyards when the financier-investor entered into the five-year agreement with the winery. The winery was thus not free to delegate its duty of grape production to an inexperienced buyer, because this act of delegation would impair the financier-investor's reasonable expectations under the agreement.

B is incorrect. Delegation is permitted unless a contract specifically prohibits delegation, or the nature of the contract is such that the transfer would impair the other party's reasonable expectations. C is incorrect. The winery's performance will now be directly based upon the agricultural corporation's output, and given the agricultural corporation's lack of experience with wine grape production, the winery has created a significant risk regarding performance. D is incorrect. Although corporations require individuals to perform duties, when they do so, they are not delegating contractual duties. The individual is acting on behalf of the corporation. The winery was experienced in the field, as were its employees.

On the above facts, when would the<b> risk of loss of the bracelets pass to the buyer</b>?",multiple-choice,"When the contract was made.","When the bracelets were identified to the contract by the seller, assuming the goods conformed to the contract.","When the bracelets were delivered to a carrier and a proper contract for their carriage was made.","When the bracelets were unloaded on the buyer's premises by the carrier.",,,3,"Under UCC § 2-509(1), a contract that requires the seller to ship goods to the buyer by a third-party carrier is either a shipment or a destination contract. Comment 5 to UCC § 2-503 provides that where the contract is otherwise silent, a shipment contract is presumed where the contract requires shipment by a third-party carrier. Since this is a shipment contract, the risk of loss would pass from the seller to the buyer when the seller duly delivered the goods to the third-party carrier. Thus, Answer C is correct. 

Answer D is incorrect. As stated in UCC § 2-509(1)(b), under a destination contract, the risk of loss shifts from the seller to the buyer when the goods are duly tendered to the buyer rather than when the goods are unloaded. More importantly, however, this is not a destination contract. Comment 5 to UCC § 2-503 provides that where the contract is otherwise silent, a shipment contract is presumed where the contract requires shipment by a third-party carrier. Because this is a shipment contract, the risk of loss would pass from the seller to the buyer when the seller duly delivered the goods to the third-party carrier. 

Answer A is incorrect. UCC § 2-509(1)(a) and (b) together refute the notion that the risk of loss passes from the seller to the buyer at the time of contract formation. UCC §§ 2-509(1) and 2-503, comment 5 govern the passing of the risk of loss under these circumstances, and, because this would be considered a shipment contract, the risk of loss would pass from the seller to the buyer when the seller duly delivered the goods to the third-party carrier. 

Answer B is incorrect. UCC § 2-501 defines the concept of identification but does not articulate the standard for determining when the risk of loss passes under the circumstances present here. UCC §§ 2-509(1) and 2-503, comment 5 govern the passing of the risk of loss under these circumstances, and, because this would be considered a shipment contract, the risk of loss would pass from the seller to the buyer when the seller duly delivered the goods to the third-party carrier.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim ""to pay from any settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries."" The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were ""non-assignable."" The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from the doctor, but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise.

After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote the doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney.

The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor. The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor. The victim remains insolvent.

In an <b>action by the doctor against the attorney</b> upon the attorney's employment contract with the victim, if the attorney attempted to use the victim's release as a defense, the doctor is likely to argue that",multiple-choice,"the release was ineffective, because the doctor had impliedly assented to the victim-attorney contract.","the release was ineffective, because the victim would thereby be unjustly enriched.","there was no consideration for the victim's release of the attorney.","the attorney's contract duties were too personal to be effectively delegated to the colleague.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary until the beneficiary's rights vest. Rights vest when the beneficiary: (1) manifests assent to the promise, (2) sues to enforce the promise, or (3) materially changes position in reliance on the promise. Here, the doctor was an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the victim and the attorney. Although the doctor received notice of the promise before the victim and the attorney executed the release, he never expressly assented to the promise. However, the doctor can argue that by not pursuing the victim and waiting to collect from the attorney, the doctor impliedly assented to the contract and that assent made the release ineffective.

B is incorrect because unjust enrichment is not relevant to the question of whether the attorney was released, and would only be relevant in a quasi-contract action against the victim. C is incorrect because the colleague's promise to represent the victim supplied sufficient consideration to support the promise to release the attorney. D is incorrect because the question of whether the attorney's duties may be freely delegated is irrelevant since the victim assented to the delegation.","Third-Party Rights"

On June 2, the seller mailed to the buyer a letter accepting the order and assuring the buyer that the computer would be shipped on June 3. On June 3, the seller realized that he was out of that computer model, shipped a different computer model to the buyer, and mailed a separate notice of accommodation.

UCC § 2-206(1)(b) provides that a seller's shipment of nonconforming goods with a notice of accommodation does not constitute an acceptance and breach, but rather a counteroffer, which the buyer is free to either accept or reject. Section 2-206(1)(b) also provides, however, that a contract calling for prompt shipment can be accepted by either a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt shipment of goods. The seller accepted the buyer's offer by a promise to ship when he mailed his June 2 letter. UCC § 2-601 allows a buyer to accept or reject nonconforming goods and in either event recover damages. The buyer has an action for breach since the computer shipped on June 3 failed to conform to the contract formed on June 2 when the seller mailed his letter of acceptance. 

Answer B is incorrect. Because the seller's June 2 letter constituted an acceptance, the seller tendered nonconforming goods that the buyer can either accept or reject. UCC § 2-711 states that upon a buyer's rightful rejection, certain remedies are also available to the buyer. The buyer can accept or reject the nonconforming computer and can recover damages, if any, for breach. 

Answer C is incorrect. The seller's shipment of the different computer model did not constitute an acceptance since the seller accepted the buyer's original offer when he mailed his June 2 letter. The buyer can accept or reject the nonconforming computer and can recover damages, if any, for breach. UCC § 2-206(1). 

Answer D is incorrect. The mailing of the notice of accommodation was irrelevant since the seller accepted the buyer's offer by promising, in his June 2 letter, to ship the computer. The buyer can accept or reject the nonconforming computer and can recover damages, if any, for breach. UCC § 2-206.","Formation of Contracts"
"Under a written agreement, a pastry company promised to sell its entire output of baked buns at a specified unit price to a baked goods retailer for one year. The baked goods retailer promised not to sell any other supplier's baked buns.

The parties' contract included a provision for termination by either party at any time upon reasonable notice. After six months of performance on both sides, the pastry company, claiming that its old bun-baker had become uneconomical and that it could not afford a new one, dismantled the bun-baker and began using the space for making dog biscuits. The pastry company's output of baked buns having ceased, the baked goods retailer sued for breach of contract. The baked goods retailer moves for summary <b>judgment on liability,</b> and the pastry company moves for summary <b>judgment of dismissal.</b>

Which of the following should the court rule?",multiple-choice,"Summary judgment for the baked goods retailer, because as a matter of law the pastry company could not discontinue production of baked buns merely because it was losing money on that product.","Summary judgment for the pastry company, because its cessation of baked-bun production and the baked goods retailer's awareness thereof amounted as a matter of law to valid notice of termination as permitted by the contract.","Both motions denied, because there are triable issues of fact as to whether the the pastry company gave reasonable notice of termination or whether its losses from continued production of baked buns were sufficiently substantial to justify cessation of production.","Both motions denied because the pastry company may legally cease production of baked buns, but under the circumstances it must share with the baked goods retailer its profits from the manufacture of dog biscuits until the end of the first year.",,,3,"C is correct. Under the UCC, a quantity term in a contract that is measured by the output of the seller means such actual output as may occur in good faith. The pastry company is permitted under the contract to reduce its output of buns, even to discontinue bun-making entirely, but only if the reason for doing so was made in good faith rather than to avoid its obligation under the contract. Therefore there is a question of fact as to whether the pastry company's decision to discontinue bun-making was made in good faith. A, B and D are incorrect. The question of whether the pastry company has breached the output contract involves an issue of material fact.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A buyer agreed in writing to purchase a car from a seller for $15,000, with the price to be paid on a specified date at the seller's showroom. The contract provided, and both parties intended, that time was of the essence. Before the specified date, however, the seller sold the car to a third party for $20,000. On the specified date, the buyer arrived at the showroom but brought only $10,000. When the seller did not appear at the showroom, the buyer called the seller and asked whether the seller would accept $10,000 for the car immediately and the remaining $5,000 in six weeks. The seller told the buyer that he had sold the car to the third party. 

If the buyer sues the seller for <b>breach </b>of contract, will the buyer be likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because the contractual obligations were discharged on the ground of impossibility.","No, because the buyer was not prepared to tender her performance on the specified date.","Yes, because the buyer's breach was not material.","Yes, because the seller anticipatorily repudiated the contract when he sold the car to the third party.",,,2,"A is incorrect. While the seller's sale of the car to a third party rendered it impossible for the seller to sell the car to the buyer, such conduct does not meet the standard to establish impossibility as a legal defense for nonperformance. Similarly, the buyer's tender of less than the full payment does not, without more, establish a legal basis for impossibility. The dispositive issue here relates to the effect of neither party tendering performance on the date specified in the contract. Under UCC Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of contract. 

B is correct. Even though the facts demonstrate that the seller repudiated the contract by selling the car to a third party, the seller did not end up breaching the contract. Under UCC Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of contract. 

C is incorrect. UCC Article 2 adopts the perfect tender rule, rather than the material breach rule, as the generally applicable standard. The dispositive issue here relates to the effect of neither party tendering performance on the date specified in the contract. Under Article 2, a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of contract. 

D is incorrect. While the seller's sale of the car to a third party would seem to constitute an anticipatory repudiation, as it turned out, neither party was prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner specified in the contract. UCC Article 2 provides that a seller's tender of delivery of goods and a buyer's tender of payment are concurrent conditions of exchange. Therefore, the buyer and the seller were obligated to simultaneously tender their respective performances. Because neither party was prepared to tender performance at the time or in the manner stipulated in the contract, each party's performance obligation was discharged. Accordingly, neither the buyer nor the seller has a claim for breach of contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A carpenter contracted with a homeowner to <b>remodel the homeowner's home for $10,000</b>, the contract price to be paid on completion of the work. On May 29, <b>relying </b>on his expectation that he would finish the work and have the homeowner's payment on June 1, the carpenter contracted to buy a car under the following terms: ""$10,000 in cash, if payment is made on June 1; if payment is made thereafter, the price is $12,000."" The <b>carpenter completed </b>the work according to specifications on June 1 and demanded payment from the homeowner on that date. The homeowner, without any excuse, refused to pay. As a result, the carpenter became very excited, <b>suffered a minor heart attack</b>, and incurred related medical expenses of $4,000. The reasonable value of the carpenter's services in remodeling the homeowner's home was $13,000.

In an action by the carpenter against the homeowner, which of the following should be the carpenter's measure of recovery?",multiple-choice,"$10,000, the contract price.","$14,000, the contract price plus $4,000 for the medical expenses incurred because the homeowner refused to pay.","$12,000, the contract price plus $2,000, the bargain that was lost because the carpenter could not pay cash for the car on June 1.","$13,000, the amount the homeowner was enriched by the carpenter's services.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The carpenter is entitled to the contract price for the work done--$10,000. The other items of damage are unrecoverable either because they were unforeseeable at the time the contract was made or because they were not caused by the breach. No unjust enrichment claim is viable on these facts, because an unjust enrichment claim cannot exceed the contract price when all of the work giving rise to the claim has been done and the only remaining obligation is the payment of the price. This limitation on unjust enrichment claims was recapitulated in the well known case of Oliver v. Campbell, 273 P.2d 15 (Cal. 1954), and represents the current rule in such cases.

Answer B is incorrect. The carpenter is entitled only to the contract price for the work done. The medical expenses are unrecoverable because even if the heart attack was caused by the breach, which would be difficult to establish, the medical expenses were unforeseeable at the time the contract was made.

Answer C is incorrect. The carpenter is entitled only to the contract price for the work done. The $2,000 for the loss of the bargain on the car was unforeseeable at the time the contract to do the work was made. That car contract was a special circumstance, of which the homeowner had no notice.

Answer D is incorrect. The carpenter is entitled only to the contract price for the work done. No unjust enrichment claim is viable on these facts, because an unjust enrichment claim cannot exceed the contract price when all of the work giving rise to the claim has been done and the only remaining obligation of the homeowner is the payment of the price. The claim has been ""liquidated"" and the work substantially performed. This limitation on unjust enrichment claims was recapitulated in the well known case of Oliver v. Campbell, 273 P.2d 15 (Cal. 1954), and represents the current rule in such cases.",Remedies
"A patient owed a physician $25,000 for professional services. The physician orally assigned this claim to her adult daughter as a wedding gift. Shortly thereafter, on suffering sudden, severe losses in the stock market, the physician assigned by a signed writing the same claim to her stockbroker in partial satisfaction of advances legally made by the stockbroker in the physician's previous stock-market transactions. Subsequently, the patient, without knowledge of either assignment, paid the physician the $25,000 then due, which the physician promptly lost at a horse track, although she remains solvent.

Assuming that Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code does NOT apply to either of the assignments in this situation, which of the following is a correct statement of the parties' rights and liabilities?",multiple-choice,"As the assignee prior in time, the daughter can recover $25,000 from the patient, who acted at her peril in paying the physician.","As the sole assignee for value, the stockbroker can recover $25,000 from the patient, who acted at her peril in paying the physician.","Neither the daughter nor the stockbroker can recover from the patient, but the daughter, though not the stockbroker, can recover $25,000 from the physician.","Neither the daughter nor the stockbroker can recover from the patient, but the stockbroker, though not the daughter, can recover $25,000 from the physician.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. When a contract right is assigned to a party gratuitously (i.e., without receiving anything in exchange), the assignor retains the power to revoke the assignment if done prior to receiving payment from the obligor, or before the assignee has relied on the assignment or brought suit to enforce it. Revocation may be effected by giving notice of revocation, obtaining performance from the obligor or assigning the same contract right to a different assignee. Until the obligor receives notice of an assignment, the obligor may discharge its contractual duty by rendering performance to the assignor.

The physician made a gratuitous assignment of the $25,000 right to payment to her daughter, which the physician revoked when she assigned the same contract right to the stockbroker. Because the stockbroker did not give the obligor (the patient) notice of the assignment, the patient could (and did) discharge her obligation under the contract by paying the physician directly. Because the stockbroker never received payment, however, the physician's debt to the stockbroker is still enforceable.

A is incorrect because the assignment to the daughter was revoked when the physician assigned the right to the stockbroker. B is incorrect because the patient did not receive notice of the assignment, and therefore effectively discharged her obligation by paying the physician directly. C is incorrect because the daughter cannot recover the $25,000 from the physician because the assignment was revoked.","Third-Party Rights"
"On March 1, a computer programming company orally agreed with a department store to write a set of programs for the department store's computer and to coordinate the programs with the department store's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety:

The department store will pay the computer programming company $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if the computer programming company is successful in shortening by one-half the processing time for the financial transactions now handled on the department store's Zenon 747 computer; the computer programming company to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing.
On June 6, the computer programming company demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After the department store denied liability, the parties orally agreed that the department store should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of the department store's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, the computer programming company completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by the computer programming company and the department store computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with the department store's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would, however, save the department store $12,000 a year. Further, if the department store would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by the computer programming company, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent, saving the department store another $8,000 a year.

The department store's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. The department store requested the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to the computer programming company even though the department store continued to use the programs.

Assume that the programs completed on July 5 had cut processing time by one-half for all of the department store's financial transactions. Is the department store entitled to renounce the contract because of the computer programming company's delay in completion?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because ""the computer programming company to complete by July 1"" is an express condition.","Yes, because the doctrine of substantial performance does not apply to commercial contracts.","No, because both parties manifested an understanding that time was not of the essence.","No, because the contract did not contain a liquidated damages clause dealing with delay in completion.",,,3,"C is correct. On a services contract, a party is generally not required to perform by the exact date stated in the contract unless time is made of the essence. If time is not of the essence, a reasonable delay is not a material breach. The computer programming company completed performance within four days of the completion date specified in the contract, which is a reasonable delay.

A is incorrect. The completion date is an express condition that was excused by substantial performance on July 5. Generally, the common law rule is that time is not of the essence unless the contract specifically has a provision stating otherwise. Thus, a four-day delay is not a material breach.

B is incorrect. This is an overstatement of the law because although the doctrine of substantial performance does not apply to contracts governed by the UCC, it can apply to commercial contracts governed by common law.

D is incorrect. A provision regarding liquidated damages would not bar recovery if there had been a material breach.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A buyer purchased a new car from a dealer under a written contract that provided that the price of the car was $20,000 and that the buyer would receive a ""trade-in allowance of $7,000 for the buyer's old car."" The old car had recently been damaged in an accident. The contract contained a merger clause stating: ""This writing constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and there are no other understandings or agreements not set forth herein."" When the buyer took possession of the new car, she delivered the old car to the dealer. At that time, the dealer claimed that the trade-in allowance included an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company for damage to the old car. The buyer refused to provide the assignment. 

The dealer sued the buyer to recover the insurance payment. The dealer has offered evidence that the parties agreed during their negotiations for the new car that the dealer was entitled to the insurance payment. 

Should the court admit this evidence?",multiple-choice,"No, because the dealer's acceptance of the old car bars any additional claim by the dealer.","No, because the merger clause bars any evidence of the parties' prior discussions concerning the trade-in allowance.","Yes, because a merger clause does not bar evidence of fraud.","Yes, because the merger clause does not bar evidence to explain what the parties meant by ""trade-in allowance.""",,,4,"A is incorrect. A buyer's mere acceptance of goods does not waive its potential claims against a seller. The dispositive issue here is whether the parol evidence rule will allow the proffered evidence. Under that rule, a merger clause does not conclusively determine that an agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not necessarily bar the admission of extrinsic evidence. Although extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to supplement or contradict the express terms of a completely integrated agreement, such evidence is admissible to explain the terms of an agreement. In this case, evidence of the parties' discussions during their negotiations is admissible to aid in explaining whether they intended ""trade-in allowance"" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company.

B is incorrect. Under the UCC's parol evidence rule, a merger clause does not conclusively determine that an agreement is completely integrated. Moreover, a finding that an agreement is completely integrated does not necessarily bar the admission of extrinsic evidence.

In this case, evidence of the parties' discussions during their negotiations is admissible to aid in explaining whether they intended ""trade-in allowance"" to include an assignment of the buyer's claim against her insurance company.

C is incorrect. The UCC's parol evidence rule allows the introduction of extrinsic evidence to establish fraud even if an agreement is completely integrated. Because there is no indication of fraud in this case, however, the fraud exception is irrelevant. The dispositive issue here is whether the parol evidence rule will allow the proffered evidence.

"On March 1, an excavator entered into a contract with a contractor to perform excavation work on a large project. The contract expressly required that the excavator begin work on June 1 to enable other subcontractors to install utilities. On May 15, the excavator requested a 30-day delay in the start date for the excavation work because he was seriously behind schedule on another project. When the contractor refused to grant the delay, the excavator stated that he would try to begin the work for the contractor on June 1.

Does the contractor have valid legal grounds to cancel the contract with the excavator and hire a replacement?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the excavator committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract by causing the contractor to feel insecure about the performance.","Yes, because the excavator breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.","No, because the excavator would be entitled to specific performance of the contract if he could begin by June 1.","No, because the excavator did not state unequivocally that he would delay the beginning of his work.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. An anticipatory repudiation occurs when a party unequivocally manifests an intention not to perform or an inability to perform. Expressions of doubt as to a party's ability to perform or a mere request by a party (in this case, the excavator) that the other party (the contractor) consider modifying their agreement would not constitute an anticipatory repudiation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 250 cmt. b. 

Answer A is incorrect. Expressions of doubt by a party as to its willingness or ability to perform do not amount to the affirmative manifestation of intent required to constitute an anticipatory repudiation. Expressions of doubt on one party's part may, however, give the other party the right to demand adequate assurance. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 250 cmt. b, 251. 

Answer B is incorrect. A mere request to delay beginning the work by the excavator, who had reasonable grounds for making the request, is not a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 250, 251. 

Answer C is incorrect. The contractor's cancellation of the contract would be wrongful and would entitle the excavator to monetary damages (anticipated profit), but not specific performance, which is available only where monetary damages are inadequate.

"A man saved the life of his friend's wife who thereafter changed her will to leave the man $1,000. However, upon the wife's death she had no property except an undivided interest in real estate held in tenancy by the entirety of the husband. The property had been purchased by the husband from an inheritance.

After the wife died, the husband signed and delivered to the man the following instrument: ""In consideration of [the man]'s saving my wife's life and his agreement to bring no claims against my estate based on her will, I hereby promise to pay [the man] $1,000.""

Upon the husband's death, the man filed a claim for $1,000. The husband's executor contested the claim on the ground that the instrument was not supported by sufficient consideration.

On which of the following theories would it be most likely that the man could recover?",multiple-choice,"The husband and the man have made a compromise.","The husband must give restitution for benefits it would be unjust to retain.","The husband is bound by promissory estoppel.","The husband executed a binding unilateral contract.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. The man supplied consideration for the husband's promise to pay the man $1,000 because his forbearance to assert a claim against the husband's qualifies as consideration so long as the man had a good faith belief in his right to make such a claim.

B is incorrect because the man conferred no direct benefit on the husband with a reasonable expectation of payment by saving the wife's life or by forbearing to make an invalid claim against the husband's estate. C is incorrect because the man cannot show that he detrimentally relied upon the husband's promise to pay. D is incorrect because the performance had already occurred and would render the agreement unenforceable based upon the past consideration doctrine if it were the only consideration. The husband, however, made an offer for a bilateral agreement when he requested the man's ""agreement to bring no claims against my estate.""","Formation of Contracts"
"Under the terms of a written contract, a builder agreed to construct for a homeowner a garage for $10,000. Nothing was said in the parties' negotiations or in the contract about progress payments during the course of the work.

After completing 25% of the garage strictly according to the homeowner's specifications, the builder demanded payment of $2,000 as a ""reasonable progress payment."" The homeowner refused, and the builder abandoned the job.

If each party sues the other for breach of contract, which of the following will the court decide?",multiple-choice,"Both parties are in breach, and each is entitled to damages, if any, from the other.","Only the builder is in breach and liable for the homeowner's damages, if any.","Only the homeowner is in breach and liable for the builder's damages, if any.","Both parties took reasonable positions, and neither is in breach.",,,2,"B is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, a party's contractual obligation is conditioned upon the other party's substantial performance. However, where one party's performance requires a period of time (such as the builder's obligation to construct the garage), that performance is due before the other party is obligated to perform, unless the contract specifies otherwise. Because the contract was silent with respect to progress payments, the homeowner was not obligated to pay any portion of the contract price until the builder had substantially performed his promise to build the garage. The builder, therefore, was not justified in abandoning the job, and his doing so after completing only 25% of the requested work was itself a material breach of the contract.

A and C are incorrect. The homeowner's refusal to pay when asked was not a breach (although the builder may be able to recover in restitution). D is incorrect. The builder's abandonment of the job without justification amounted to a breach.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"Two salesmen, who lived in different suburbs twenty miles apart, were golfing acquaintances at the Interurban Country Club. Both were traveling salesmen--one for a pharmaceutical company and the other for a widget manufacturer. The pharmaceutical salesman wrote the widget salesman by United States mail on Friday, October 8:

I need a motorcycle for transportation to the country club and will buy your Sujocki for $1,200 upon your bringing it to my home address above [stated in the letterhead] on or before noon, November 12 next. This offer is not subject to countermand.

Sincerely,

[signed] the pharmaceutical salesman

The widget salesman replied by mail the following day:

I accept your offer, and promise to deliver the bike as you specified.

Sincerely,

[signed] the widget salesman

This letter, although properly addressed, was misdirected by the postal service and not received by the pharmaceutical salesman until November 10. The pharmaceutical salesman had bought another Sujocki bike from a different friend for $1,050 a few hours before.

The friend saw the widget salesman at the Interurban Country Club on November 11 and said: ""I sold my Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman yesterday for $1,050. Would you consider selling me yours for $950?"" The widget salesman replied: ""I'll let you know in a few days.""

On November 12, the widget salesman took his Sujocki to the pharmaceutical salesman's residence; he arrived at 11:15 a.m. The pharmaceutical salesman was asleep and did not answer the ringing doorbell until 12:15 p.m. The pharmaceutical salesman then rejected the widget salesman's bike on the ground that he had already bought someone else's bike.

In the pharmaceutical salesman's letter of October 8, what was the legal effect of the language: ""This offer is not subject to countermand""?",multiple-choice,"Under the Uniform Commercial Code the offer was irrevocable until noon, November 12.","Such language prevented an effective acceptance by the widget salesman prior to noon, November 12.","At common law, such language created a binding option in the widget salesman's favor.","Such language did not affect the offeror's power of revocation of the offer.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. No consideration was paid for the option, and the pharmaceutical salesman is not a merchant, so the UCC's firm offer rule does not apply. Therefore, the language has no effect and the offer remained freely revocable.

A is incorrect because UCC 2-205 limits the firm offer rule to merchants. Because the pharmaceutical salesman does not deal in motorcycles or otherwise hold himself out by occupation as having knowledge or skill specific to the goods involved in the transaction, he will not be considered a merchant under the UCC. (See UCC 2-104)

B is incorrect because the language, ""This offer is not subject to countermand,"" relates to the pharmaceutical salesman's power as the offeror to revoke, not to the widget salesman's power of acceptance. C is incorrect because for an option promise to be enforceable at common law it must be supported by consideration.","Formation of Contracts"
"A landowner and a contractor entered into a written contract under which the contractor agreed to build a building and pave an adjacent sidewalk for the landowner at a price of $200,000. Later, while construction was proceeding, the landowner and the contractor entered into an oral modification under which the contractor was not obligated to pave the sidewalk but still would be entitled to $200,000 upon completion. The contractor completed the building. The landowner, after discussions with his landscaper, demanded that the contractor pave the adjacent sidewalk. The contractor refused. 

Has the contractor breached the contract?",multiple-choice,"No, because the oral modification was in good faith and therefore enforceable.","Yes, because a discharge of a contractual obligation must be in writing.","Yes, because the parol evidence rule bars proof of the oral modification.","Yes, because there was no consideration for the discharge of the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Because it is a contract for services, this contract is governed by the common law of contracts, and not the Uniform Commercial Code. The prevailing common law view is that a modification to a contract requires consideration to be valid. Here, there was no consideration for the elimination of the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk. The contractor actually promised to do less than he was under a preexisting duty to do, and so there was no enforceable modification of the contract. 

Answer A is incorrect. This contract is governed by the common law of contracts, and not the Uniform Commercial Code. Unlike the UCC, the prevailing common law view is that a modification to a contract requires consideration to be valid. Here, there was no consideration for the elimination of the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk. The contractor actually promised to do less than he was under a preexisting duty to do, and so there was no enforceable modification of the contract. 

Answer B is incorrect. It is true that the contractor breached the contract, but there is no rule requiring the discharge of a contractual obligation to be in writing. There are many ways in which a discharge might arise, in addition to discharges by mutual agreement. But even in the case of discharge by mutual agreement, there is no general rule requiring a writing. The issue is whether the parties' oral exchange regarding the sidewalk resulted in an enforceable modification of the contract. As explained above, the contract modification is unenforceable for lack of consideration. 

Answer C is incorrect. It is true that the contractor breached the contract, but the parol evidence rule is not applicable. The parol evidence rule applies to exclude some kinds of evidence with respect to discussions held, or correspondence exchanged, either prior to or contemporaneous with the making of a contract. In this case, the crucial exchange occurred after the contract was made, and so the issue is whether that exchange resulted in an enforceable modification of the contract. Because this contract is governed by the common law of contracts and not the Uniform Commercial Code, the modification required consideration to be enforceable. There was no consideration in this case for the elimination of the contractor's duty to pave the sidewalk. The contractor actually promised to do less than it was under a preexisting duty to do, and so there was no enforceable modification of the contract.","Formation of Contracts"
"An assistant professor was hired by a college to teach mathematics and he is now in his third consecutive one-year contract. Under state law he cannot acquire tenure until after five consecutive annual contracts. In his third year, the assistant professor was notified that he was not being rehired for the following year. Applicable state law and college rules did not require either a statement of reasons or a hearing, and in fact neither was offered to the assistant professor.

Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest argument the assistant professor could make to compel the college to furnish him a statement of reasons for the failure to rehire him and an opportunity for a hearing?",multiple-choice,"There is no evidence that tenured teachers are any more qualified than he is.","He leased a home in reliance on an oral promise of reemployment by the college president.","He was the only teacher at the college whose contract was not renewed that year.","In the expectation of remaining at the college, he had just moved his elderly parents to the town in which college is located.",,,2,"B is correct. If the assistant professor leased a home in response to an oral promise of reemployment by the college president, this establishes detrimental reliance on the part of the assistant professor and would provide a substitute for consideration. Since the president should have expected to induce action with his promise, a statement of reasons and a hearing may be necessary to determine a just remedy.

A is incorrect. The experience of a tenured professor is irrelevant. C is incorrect. He had no contractual rights to renewal and no contractual rights to a hearing or statement of reasons. D is incorrect. The assistant professor's subjective expectation of renewal would not be sufficient to compel the college to furnish him a statement of reasons or a hearing.","Formation of Contracts"
"After several days of negotiations, an office building owner wrote to a plumber: ""Will pay you $3,000 if you will install new plumbing in my office building according to the specifications I have sent you. I must have your reply by March 30."" The plumber replied by a letter that the owner received on March 15: ""Will not do it for less than $3,500."" On March 20, the plumber wrote to the owner: ""Have changed my mind. I will do the work for $3,000. Unless I hear from you to the contrary, I will begin work on April 5."" The owner received this letter on March 22 but did not reply to it. The plumber, without the owner's knowledge, began the work on April 5.

Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the owner and the plumber as of April 5?",multiple-choice,"A contract was formed on March 20 when the plumber posted his letter.","A contract was formed on March 22 when the owner received the plumber's letter.","A contract was formed on April 5 when the plumber began work.","There was no contract between the parties as of April 5.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. The plumber's rejection of the owner's offer on the 15th ended that negotiation, and the letter sent on the 20th was a new, separate, and distinct offer. There was no contract because silence could only operate as an acceptance in this case if the owner wished or intended to be bound by his silence. The plumber bears the risk of uncertainty in phrasing his offer in this manner; the purpose underlying this rule of law is to protect the offeree from imposition. Thus, the owner's silence will operate as acceptance only if he intends for his silence to manifest acceptance. Because he is unaware of the plumber's performance, there are no facts to support his intent to accept the offer made by the plumber on March 20.

A and B are incorrect because the plumber's March 20 letter containing a different price term operated as a counter offer, which required acceptance by the owner to create an enforceable contract. C is incorrect because the plumber made a counter offer which only the owner could accept.","Formation of Contracts"
"A seller and a buyer, standing on Greenacre, orally agreed to its sale and purchase for $5,000 and orally marked its bounds as ""that line of trees down there, the ditch that intersects them, the fence on the other side, and that street on the fourth side.""

In which of the following is the remedy of reformation most appropriate?",multiple-choice,"As later reduced to writing, the agreement by clerical mistake included two acres that are actually beyond the fence.","The buyer reasonably thought that two acres beyond the fence were included in the oral agreement but the seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement included the two acres.","The buyer reasonably thought that the price orally agreed upon was $4,500, but the seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement said $5,000.","The buyer reasonably thought that a dilapidated shed backed up against the fence was to be torn down and removed as part of the agreement, but the seller did not. As later reduced to writing, the agreement said nothing about the shed.",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Where a clerical error has been made in reducing an agreement to writing, a party may bring an action in equitable reformation to have the writing reformed to correct the writing or include an omitted provision. The parol evidence rule does not bar the introduction of evidence to show the mistake that forms the basis for reformation. Because the seller and the buyer verbally agreed that the boundary of Greenacre was the fence, the writing may be reformed if it mistakenly includes a reference to the two acres beyond the fence. B, C and D are incorrect because reformation is not available to correct a mistake unless the parties actually reached an agreement prior to reducing the agreement to writing.",Remedies
"A famous chef entered into a written agreement with his friend, a well-known interior decorator respected for his unique designs, in which the decorator agreed, for a fixed fee, to design the interior of the chef's new restaurant, and, upon the chef's approval of the design plan, to decorate and furnish the restaurant accordingly. The agreement was silent as to assignment or delegation by either party. Before beginning the work, the decorator sold his decorating business to Newman under an agreement in which the decorator assigned to Newman, and Newman agreed to complete, the chef-decorator contract. Newman, also an experienced decorator of excellent repute, advised the chef of the assignment, and supplied him with information confirming both Newman's financial responsibility and past commercial success.

Is the chef obligated to permit Newman to perform the chef-decorator agreement?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the agreement contained no prohibition against assignment or delegation.","Yes, because the chef received adequate assurances of Newman's ability to complete the job.","No, because the decorator's duties were of a personal nature, involving his reputation, taste, and skill.","No, because the decorator's purported delegation to Newman of his obligations to the chef effected a novation.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. Unless the contract provides otherwise, a contractual duty may be delegated to another unless the other party to the contract has a substantial interest in having the original obligor perform. Typically the other party will have such an interest where the contract is a personal services contract involving fancy, taste and judgment. Although the the chef-decorator contract was silent on the issue of assignability, the facts suggest that the chef would have a substantial interest in having the decorator and no other person design the interior of his new restaurant. Therefore, the decorator's delegation of the duty to Newman without the chef's consent amounts to a breach of contract.

A is incorrect because delegation is restricted in this case even though the contract is silent on the issue. B is incorrect because the chef need not accept the delegation regardless of assurances of performance from Newman. D is incorrect because a novation would require express agreement from the chef to substitute Newman for the decorator.","Third-Party Rights"
"A landowner entered into a single contract with a builder to have three different structures built on separate pieces of property owned by the landowner. Each structure was distinct from the other two, and the parties agreed on a specific price for each. After completing the first structure in accordance with the terms of the contract, the builder demanded payment of the specified price for that structure. At the same time, the builder told the landowner that the builder was ""tired of the construction business"" and would not even begin the other two structures. The landowner refused to pay anything to the builder.

Is the <b>builder likely to prevail </b>in a suit for the agreed price of the first structure?",multiple-choice,"No, because substantial performance is a constructive condition to the landowner's duty to pay at the contract rate.","No, because the builder's cessation of performance without legal excuse is a willful breach of the contract.","Yes, because the contract is divisible, and the landowner will be required to bring a separate claim for the builder's failure to complete the other two structures.","Yes, because the contract is divisible, but the landowner will be able to deduct any recoverable damages caused by the builder's failure to complete the contract.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Contract law acknowledges the fact that parties sometimes embody obligations which are in most respects separable into a single document or agreement. The rules for damages permit the separable components to be treated separately, which is appropriate here, since the structures were to be built on separate pieces of land, and there were prices related to each distinct property. Another rationale for the divisibility of obligations is to avoid a forfeiture.

Answer A is incorrect. The substantial performance rule doesn't apply here, because the obligations were separable, and the builder DID substantially complete the first structure. The builder is likely to recover the agreed price of the first structure, less any recoverable damages caused to the landowner as a result of the builder's breach.

Answer B is incorrect. Though willfulness might, in some cases, be a factor to be considered in a breach of contract case, it doesn't affect recovery in this case. The builder is likely to recover the agreed price of the first structure, less any recoverable damages caused to the landowner as a result of the builder's breach. The obligations of the builder were severable for purposes of calculating damages; the structures were to be built on separate pieces of land and there were distinct prices related to each distinct property.

Answer C is incorrect. The first part of the statement is correct-—the contract is divisible. But this does not mean that the victim of the breach is required to bring separate claims. Though the contract has separable components, for damages purposes, it is still a single contract. In addition, requiring separate claims would be inconsistent with the law's goal of providing for the disposition, in a single action, of closely-related claims. The builder is likely to recover the agreed price of the first structure, less any recoverable damages caused to the landowner as a result of the builder's breach.",Remedies
"A computer company contracted in writing with a bank to sell and deliver to the bank a mainframe computer using a new type of magnetic memory, then under development but not perfected by the computer company, at a price substantially lower than that of a similar computer using current technology. The contract's delivery term was ""F.O.B. the bank, on or before July 31.""

After making the contract with the bank, the computer company discovered that the new technology it intended to use was unreliable and that no computer manufacturer could yet build a reliable computer using that technology. The computer company thereupon notified the bank that it was impossible for the computer company or anyone else to build the contracted-for computer ""in the present state of the art.""

If the bank sues the computer company for<b> failure to perform </b>its computer contract, the court will probably decide the case in favor of",multiple-choice,"the computer company, because its performance of the contract was objectively impossible.","the computer company, because a contract to build a machine using technology under development imposes only a duty on the builder to use its best efforts to achieve the result contracted for.","the bank, because the law of impossibility does not apply to merchants under the applicable law.","the bank, because the computer company assumed the risk, in the given circumstances, that the projected new technology would not work reliably.",,,4,"Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, delay or non-delivery by a seller is not a breach of a contract of sale where performance has been made impracticable by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption of the contract. Excuse on grounds of impracticability will not be available, however, if the event in question was sufficiently foreshadowed so as to fairly be viewed as part of the risks that the seller assumed when entering into the contract. At the time that it undertook to sell the mainframe computer, the computer company was aware that the new technology it was planning to utilize was not yet perfected. Therefore, the fact that this technology turned out to be unreliable is a risk that the computer company should bear, and therefore the computer company's failure to perform the contract should not be excused.

A is incorrect because the UCC test for excuse on grounds of impracticability focuses not on whether performance is impossible but on whether the party seeking excuse should be found to bear the risk of the event that renders performance impracticable. B is incorrect because it is not true; if the computer company wanted to undertake only a ""best efforts"" obligation, it should have expressly so stated in the contract. C is incorrect because the UCC doctrine of impracticability applies to merchants as well as non-merchants.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"While negligently driving his father's uninsured automobile, the 25-year-old son crashed into an automobile driven by a woman. Both the son and the woman were injured. The father, erroneously believing that he was liable because he owned the automobile, said to the woman: ""I will see to it that you are reimbursed for any losses you incur as a result of the accident."" The father also called a physician and told him to take care of the woman and that he would pay the bill.

The son, having no assets, died as a result of his injuries. One of the son's creditors wrote to the father stating that his son owed him a clothing bill of $200 and that he was going to file a claim against the son's estate. The father replied: ""If you don't file a claim against my son's estate, I will pay what he owed you.""

In an action by the woman against the father for wages lost while she was incapacitated as a result of the accident, which of the following would be the father's best defense?",multiple-choice,"Lack of consideration","Mistake of fact as to basic assumption","Statute of Frauds","Indefiniteness of the father's promise",,,1,"Answer A is correct. Generally, valuable consideration on both sides of the bargain is required for an enforceable contract. Here, the woman has given no consideration for the father's promise that the woman will be reimbursed. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the woman detrimentally relied on the promise so the man will not be estopped from not performing. Since there was no consideration, and promissory estoppel is not applicable, the father's promise will not be enforceable due to lack of consideration.

B is incorrect because if the father's mistake of fact was unilateral, then the mistake will not prevent the formation of a contract. If the mistake of fact was mutual, the contract will still be enforceable as the father bore the risk that his assumption about his liability was incorrect. C is incorrect because the father's promise does not fall under the Statute of Frauds; it is not a suretyship agreement because the father believed he was vicariously liable. D is incorrect because a promise is sufficiently definite if it provides a basis for determining breach and for giving a remedy. Thus, the father's promise to pay for ""any losses…as a result of the accident"" is sufficiently definite.","Formation of Contracts"
"A collector bought from a gallery a painting correctly described in the parties' signed contract as a ""one-of-a-kind self-portrait"" by a famous artist who had recently died. The contract price was $500,000 in cash, payable one month after a truck carrier delivered the painting to the collector. 

The painting was damaged in transit. The collector timely rejected it after inspection, immediately notified the gallery of the rejection, and told the gallery that the painting would be available for pickup. The gallery then sold the painting to a third party. It informed the collector that it would pick up the painting within a couple of weeks. Two weeks later, before the gallery picked up the painting, the collector sold and delivered the painting to an art admirer for $550,000 cash, after notifying the admirer about the damage. The collector sent no money to the gallery.

The collector rightfully rejected the goods. However, the collector's exercise of ownership by selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful against the gallery and constituted conversion. The remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the goods at the time of the conversion. The collector's sale of the painting for $550,000 provides credible evidence of the painting's fair market value at the time of the conversion. UCC §§ 2-601 cmt. 2, 1-103(b) 

Answer B is incorrect. The collector's exercise of ownership by selling the painting, after his rejection, was wrongful against the gallery and constituted conversion. The gallery should not be limited to the contract price for determining the value of the painting, because the remedy for conversion is the fair market value of the goods at the time of the conversion, which occurred when the collector sold the painting for $550,000.

"By the terms of a written contract signed by both parties on January 15, a computer store agreed to sell a specific ICB personal computer to a customer for $3,000, and the customer agreed to pick up and pay for the computer at the store on February 1. The customer unjustifiably repudiated on February 1. Without notifying the customer, the store subsequently sold at private sale the same specific computer to a different buyer, who paid the same price ($3,000) in cash. The ICB is a popular product. The computer store can buy from the manufacturer more units than it can sell at retail.

Under the UCC, where the buyer has repudiated a contract the seller may, if resale is done in accordance with UCC rules (which among other things requires giving notice to buyer of any private resale), recover the difference between the contract price and the resale price, plus any incidental damages. In the alternative, the seller may recover the difference between the contract price and the market price at the time for tender. Where the market formula of damages is inadequate, the seller may recover its lost profit on the sale (plus incidental damages), if the seller can demonstrate that it could have profitably made the extra sale had the contract gone forward (i.e., that it is a ""lost volume"" seller). When the customer repudiated the contract to buy the computer from the store, the store resold the computer to a different buyer for the same contract price. Because the store did not give notice of resale to the customer, it may not rely on the resale formula in calculating damages, but this will have no effect on damages because the resale and the contract price are the same. But because the store can obtain more units than it can sell at retail, this suggests that the store is a ""lost volume"" seller and therefore can recover the profit it expected to earn on the contract, plus incidental damages.

A is incorrect because the UCC allows recovery of lost profit, as explained above. B is incorrect because failure to give notice of resale does not completely cut off the seller's right to recover damages. D is incorrect because the UCC formula requires subtracting from the contract price the value of the good to be sold (regardless of the nature of the repudiation).",Remedies
"On July 18, a shovel manufacturer received an order for the purchase of 500 snow shovels from a wholesaler. The wholesaler had mailed the purchase order on July 15.

A promise is not consideration to support a return promise if by its terms the promisor unconditionally reserves the right of alternative performances, such as reserving the right to cancel an order. Such a promise is an illusory promise. When the wholesaler reserved the right to cancel the order at any time before September 1, this meant that as of July 22, the wholesaler gave only an illusory promise to purchase the shovels. Therefore, as of that time the contract was not enforceable against either party.

B is incorrect because, in general, offers are revocable and a contract may be formed as long as an offer is not actually revoked. Because there is no indication in the fact pattern that the offer was revoked, a valid contract may have been formed. C is incorrect because a contract was not formed as of July 22 and because only the wholesaler reserved the right to terminate. D is incorrect because a contract was not formed as of July 22 and because the facts do not suggest that the manufacturer gave the wholesaler an option.","Formation of Contracts"

Neither party tendered performance on the dates stated. On May 3, 2007, the buyer notified the landowner in writing of the buyer's election to cancel the contract because of the landowner's failure to deliver title by May 1. On May 12, the landowner notified the buyer that some unanticipated construction difficulties had been encountered but that the landowner was entitled to a reasonable time to complete. The notification also included a promise that the landowner would be ready to perform by May 29, and he was setting that date as an adjourned closing date. The landowner obtained a certificate of occupancy and appropriate documents of title, and he tendered performance on May 29. The buyer refused. The landowner brought an action to <b>recover damages for breach of contract</b>. Which of the following would most affect the outcome?",multiple-choice,"The landowner acted with due diligence in completing the house.","The buyer can prove actual ""undue hardship"" caused by the delay.","The expressions ""inside date"" and ""outside date"" are construed to make time of the essence.","The buyer makes a showing of good faith in his effort to terminate the contract.",,,3,"C is correct. If this language is construed as making time of the essence, it becomes an express condition to the buyer's obligation to pay. The landowner's failure to meet this condition would discharge the buyer's duty to perform.

A is incorrect. Acting with due diligence will not excuse the failure to perform on time if the nature of the contract makes timely performance essential. B is incorrect. Proving the delay created an undue hardship on the buyer would not be a factor in determining if the failure of the landowner to provide timely performance was a material breach of the contract. D is incorrect. The buyer's right to terminate is dependent upon whether the breach was material. The existence of good faith in the builder's efforts to terminate is irrelevant as there is no evidence that the buyer attempted to frustrate timely completion.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"
"A victim, injured by a driver in an auto accident, employed an attorney to represent him in the matter. The victim was chronically insolvent and expressed doubt whether he could promptly get necessary medical treatment. Accordingly, the attorney wrote into their contract his promise to the victim ""to pay from any settlement with the driver compensation to any physician who provides professional services for the victim's injuries."" The contract also provided that the attorney's duties were ""non-assignable."" The attorney immediately filed suit against the driver. The victim then sought and received medical treatment, reasonably valued at $1,000, from a doctor, but failed to inform the doctor of the attorney's promise.

After receiving a bill from the doctor for $1,000, the victim immediately wrote doctor explaining that he was unable to pay and enclosing a copy of his contract with the attorney.

The victim then asked the attorney about payment of this bill, but the attorney requested a release from their employment contract, stating that he would like to refer the victim's claim to a colleague and that the colleague was willing to represent the victim in the pending lawsuit. The victim wrote a letter to the attorney releasing him from their contract and agreeing to the colleague's representation. A copy of this letter was sent to the doctor. The colleague subsequently promised the attorney to represent the victim and soon negotiated a settlement of the victim's claim against the driver which netted $1,000, all of which was paid by the victim to creditors other than the doctor.

An implied-in-fact contract is a type of enforceable contract, but one that is based on a tacit rather than an express promise. An implied-in-fact promise may be inferred from parties' conduct, such as where services are rendered by one person to another under circumstances where it may fairly be presumed that the parties understood that compensation would be paid. The doctor is entitled to recover payment from the victim on an implied-in-fact contract theory, since the victim implicitly agreed to pay for services rendered when the victim sought and received medical treatment from the doctor.

A and B are incorrect because the promise to pay in that agreement was made by the attorney and not by the victim. C is incorrect because this fact alone would not give rise to an obligation to pay for the services.","Formation of Contracts"

The form concluded, ""This proposal will not become a contract until signed by you [the developer] and then returned to and signed by me [the well driller].""

The developer signed the form and returned it to the well driller, who neglected to sign it but promptly began drilling the well at the proposed site on the developer's project. After drilling for two days, the well driller told the developer during one of the developer's daily visits that he would not finish unless the developer would agree to pay twice the price recited in the written proposal. The developer refused, the well driller quit, and the developer hired substitute to drill the well to completion for a price of $7,500.

An offer is a manifestation of a willingness to bargain that creates a capacity in the offeree to form a contract by consent. Since the form that the well driller sent to the developer stated that the proposal would not be a contract until signed by both parties, it is not an offer because it does not manifest an intent to conclude a contract upon mere signing by the developer. However, after the developer signed the form, the form became an offer that the well driller could accept either by signing the form or by manifesting assent in some other way (such as by commencing performance).

A is incorrect because the developer's signing of the form amounted to an offer and not an acceptance. C is incorrect because the well driller manifested assent by commencing performance.

"A seller and a buyer entered into a written agreement providing that the seller was to deliver 1,000 cases of candy bars to the buyer during the months of May and June. Under the agreement, the buyer was obligated to make a selection by March 1 of the quantities of the various candy bars to be delivered under the contract. The buyer did not make the selection by March 1, and on March 2 the seller notified the buyer that because of the buyer's failure to select, the seller would not deliver the candy bars. The seller had all of the necessary candy bars on hand on March 1 and made no additional sales or purchases on March 1 or March 2. On March 2, after receiving the seller's notice that it would not perform, the buyer notified the seller of its selection and insisted that the seller perform. The seller refused.

If the buyer sues the seller for breach of contract, is the buyer likely to prevail?",multiple-choice,"No, because a contract did not exist until the buyer selected the specific candy bars, and the seller withdrew its offer before selection.","No, because the buyer's selection of the candy bars by March 1 was an express condition to the seller's duty to perform.","Yes, because a delay of one day in making the selection did not have a material effect on the seller.","Yes, because upon the buyer's failure to make a selection by March 1, the seller had a duty to make a reasonable selection.",,,3,"Answer A is incorrect. UCC § 2-311(1) specifically rejects the notion that a contract that is otherwise sufficiently definite is invalid because the agreement fails to specify the assortment of goods to be delivered to the buyer. 

Answer B is incorrect. The buyer's selection of candy bars was a constructive condition to the seller's performance obligation. However, the buyer's delay of one day in making the selection did not invalidate the contract because it did not have a material impact on the seller's performance. UCC § 2-311 

Answer C is correct. UCC § 2-311 imposes a duty on a buyer to cooperate by specifying the assortment of goods where the contract fails to so provide. A seller can treat a buyer's failure to specify as a breach only if the buyer's failure to specify materially impacts the seller's performance. The seller had an available supply of candy bars and had entered into no new contracts. These facts support the conclusion that the buyer's failure to select did not materially impact the seller's performance. Therefore the seller unjustifiably refused to accept the buyer's selection of goods. UCC § 2-311. 

Answer D is incorrect. The right of the seller to select is merely one of the options available to the seller when the buyer's failure to select has a material impact on the seller's performance. In this case, however, the buyer's failure to select did not have a material impact on the seller's performance, and the buyer should still have had the opportunity to select an assortment of candy bars on March 2.

On March 10, the buyer dictated the agreement to his secretary but omitted all reference to the payment of the $25,000 to the creditor. In typing the agreement, the secretary mistakenly typed $45,000 rather than $46,000 as the purchase price. Neither the buyer nor the seller carefully read the writing before signing it on March 15. Neither noticed the error in price and neither raised any question concerning omission of the payment to the creditor.

A third party acquires standing to enforce a promise only if that party is an intended beneficiary of the promise. The promisor and promisee retain the power to modify or discharge a duty owed to an intended beneficiary until the beneficiary's rights vest. The beneficiary's rights will vest if he manifests assent to or materially changes his position in justifiable reliance on the promise before receiving notice of the discharge. Since the promise at issue is the buyer's promise to pay $25,000 ""to the creditor,"" the creditor is an intended beneficiary because the performance flows directly to him. However, if the buyer and seller later agree not to pay any of the purchase price to the creditor before the creditor was aware of the contract, that agreement would be effective in discharging the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary because those rights would not have vested.

A is incorrect. What matters is whether the buyer's promise is supported by consideration (which it was); it is irrelevant whether the seller's promise to the creditor was so supported. C is incorrect. The creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary is based on an agreement that was only effective on March 1. The statute of limitations does not run on a third-party claim simply because the contract is completed. D is incorrect. Bringing suit to enforce the promise causes the rights to vest; no other notification is necessary.","Third-Party Rights"
"A new business enterprise about to commence the manufacture of clothing, entered into a written agreement to purchase all of its monthly requirements of a certain elasticized fabric for a period of three years from a fabric company at a specified unit price, and agreed upon delivery and payment terms. The agreement also provided:
1. The parties covenant not to assign this contract.

2. Payments coming due hereunder for the first two months shall be made directly by the new business enterprise to the creditor of the fabric company.
The fabric company promptly made an ""assignment of the contract"" to a finance company as security for a $100,000 loan. The new enterprise subsequently ordered, took delivery of, and paid the fabric company the agreed price ($5,000) for the new enterprise's requirement of the fabric for the first month of its operation.

Assume that the assignment from the fabric company to the finance company was effective, and that the new enterprise was unaware of the assignment when it paid the fabric company the $5,000. Which of the following is correct?",multiple-choice,"The new business enterprise is liable to the finance company for $5,000.","The fabric company is liable to the finance company for $5,000.","The new business enterprise and the fabric company are each liable to the finance company for $2,500.","Neither the new business enterprise nor the fabric company is liable to the finance company for any amount.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The fabric company was required to provide clear and adequate notice to the business enterprise of the assignment to the finance company before the business enterprise made payment. A and C are incorrect because when the business enterprise paid the fabric company before receiving notice of the assignment, the business enterprise's obligation was discharged. D is incorrect because an effective assignment by the fabric company to the finance company resulted in the finance company's standing in the place of the fabric company for receipt of payment. The anti-assignability clause in the contract between the business enterprise and the fabric company took away the fabric company's right to assign, but not its ability to assign.","Third-Party Rights"
"A testator, whose nephew was his only heir, died leaving a will that gave his entire estate to charity. The nephew, knowing full well that the testator was of sound mind all of his life, and having no evidence to the contrary, nevertheless filed a suit contesting the testator's will on the ground that the testator was incompetent when the will was signed. The testator's executor, offered the nephew $5,000 to settle the suit, and the nephew agreed.

If the executor then repudiates the agreement and the foregoing facts are proved or admitted in the nephew's suit against the executor for breach of contract, is the nephew entitled to recover under the prevailing view?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because the nephew-executor agreement was a bargained for exchange.","Yes, because the law encourages the settlement of disputed claims.","No, because the nephew did not bring the will contest in good faith.","No, because an agreement to oust the court of its jurisdiction to decide a will contest is contrary to public policy.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The nephew did not provide consideration when he agreed to settle his claim against the testator's estate because he knew that he was surrendering an invalid claim. Answer A is incorrect because although the nephew bargained for the settlement, he knew he was not agreeing to surrender any right at the time he entered into the agreement. Answer B is incorrect because although the law encourages settlement, it does so when the settlement is undertaken based upon the good faith belief that the party is relinquishing a valid claim. Answer D is incorrect because parties can modify legal rights and settle disputes so long as they do so in good faith.","Formation of Contracts"
"The owner of a fleet of taxis contracted with a dealer in petroleum products for the purchase and sale of the taxi fleet owner's total requirements of gasoline and oil for one year. As part of that agreement, the petroleum dealer also agreed with the taxi fleet owner that for one year the petroleum dealer would place all his advertising with the taxi fleet owner's wife who owned her own small advertising agency. When the wife was informed of the owner-dealer contract, she declined to accept an advertising account from the soap company because she could not handle both the petroleum dealer and the soap company accounts during the same year.

During the first month of the contract, the taxi fleet owner purchased substantial amounts of his gasoline from a supplier other than the petroleum dealer, and the petroleum dealer thereupon notified the wife that he would no longer place his advertising with her agency.

In an action against the petroleum dealer for breach of contract, the wife probably will",multiple-choice,"succeed, because she is a third-party beneficiary of the owner-dealer contract.","succeed, because the taxi fleet owner was acting as the wife's agent when he contracted with the petroleum dealer.","not succeed, because the failure of a constructive condition precedent excused the petroleum dealer's duty to place his advertising with the wife.","not succeed, because the wife did not provide any consideration to support the petroleum dealer's promise to place his advertising with her.",,,3,"C is correct. Under the doctrine of constructive conditions, where one performance will take a period of time to complete while the other can be completed in an instant, completion of the longer performance is a condition precedent to the shorter performance. A party's obligation to perform a contractual duty is excused if the other party fails to satisfy a condition precedent. Implicit in a requirements contract for the purchase and sale of a good is the buyer's obligation to purchase all of its requirements for the good exclusively from the seller for the duration of the contract. Because the taxi fleet owner agreed to purchase its total requirements for gasoline and oil from the petroleum dealer for one year, its purchase of substantial amounts of gasoline from a competitor amounted to a material breach, thereby justifying the petroleum dealer's repudiation of its obligation to place advertising with the wife.

A is incorrect. Even if the wife was an intended beneficiary, the petroleum dealer can raise any defense against her that he can raise against the taxi fleet owner (i.e., that the taxi fleet owner committed a material breach). B is incorrect. The facts show that only the taxi fleet owner was party to the contract with the petroleum dealer; the wife was, if anything, only an incidental beneficiary. D is incorrect. The consideration supporting the petroleum dealer's obligation to the wife was the taxi fleet owner's promise pursuant to the requirements contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"

Which of the following accurately states the legal effect of the covenant not to assign the contract?",multiple-choice,"The covenant made the assignment to the finance company ineffective.","The covenant had no legal effect.","The fabric company's assignment was a breach of its contract with the new enterprise but was nevertheless effective to transfer the fabric company's rights against the new enterprise to the finance company.","By normal interpretation, a covenant against assignment in a sale-of-goods agreement applies only to the buyer, not the seller.",,,3,"Answer C is correct. The fabric company breached the contract because it contained an express prohibition of assignment of rights. A prohibition against the assignment of a contract takes away the assignor's right to assign, not the assignor's power to assign. If an assignment is made in breach of an express contractual provision, the obligor (the business enterprise) has a right to damages for the breach, but this right does not render the assignment ineffective unless the assignee (the finance company) knew of the prohibition. For this reason, A is incorrect. Note: a prohibition against assignment is not the same as an invalidation of an assignment. In the latter situation, if a contractual provision renders an assignment void, the assignor has neither the right nor the power to assign the contract.

B is incorrect because the covenant does allow the business enterprise to sue for damages for breach of the covenant. D is incorrect because covenants against assignment can apply to either the buyer or seller, and the express terms of the agreement preclude both parties from assigning the contract.","Third-Party Rights"

In response to the customer's letter, the supplier called the customer and stated that the<b> offer was no longer open</b>. The supplier promptly sold the freezer to another buyer for $11,000.

It is true that a purported acceptance that is conditioned on an offeror's assent to a term additional to or different from the terms contained in an offer is a counteroffer. In this case, however, the customer's letter constituted an acceptance rather than a counteroffer. Under UCC § 2-314, a warranty of merchantability is implied in every contract for the sale of a good by a seller who is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Therefore, the condition contained in the customer's letter merely stated a term that was already implied in the sale. A contract arose when the customer mailed its letter accepting the offer. Accordingly, the supplier's attempted revocation of its offer was ineffective, and its sale of the freezer to the third party breached its contract with the customer. 

B is Incorrect. Under some circumstances, the sale of goods to a bona fide purchaser may cut off the claims of other parties. In this case, however, the dispositive issue is whether the customer's letter in response to the supplier's offer constituted an acceptance or a counteroffer. Under UCC § 2-314, a warranty of merchantability is implied in every contract for the sale of a good by a seller who is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.

D is Incorrect. The supplier's letter did not create a firm offer because it failed to give assurance that the offer would be held open, a principal requirement of a firm offer under UCC § 2-205.

"In financial straits and needing $4,000 immediately, a nephew asked his uncle for a $4,000 loan. The uncle said that he would lend the money to the nephew only if the nephew's mother would <b>""guarantee"" the loan</b>. At the nephew's suggestion, the uncle then telephoned the nephew's mother, told her about the loan, and asked if she would guarantee it. She replied, ""Yes. Lend my son the $4,000, and I'll repay it if he doesn't."" The uncle then lent $4,000 to the nephew, and the nephew orally agreed to repay that amount in six weeks. The next day, the nephew's mother wrote to him and concluded her letter with the words, ""Son, I was happy to do you a favor by <b>promising your uncle</b> I would repay your six-week $4,000 loan if you don't. /s/ Mother."" Neither the nephew nor his mother repaid the loan when it came due, and the uncle sued the mother for breach of contract. In that action, the mother raised the statute of frauds as her only defense.

Will the mother's statute-of-frauds defense likely be successful?",multiple-choice,"No, because the amount of the loan was less than $5,000.","No, because the mother's letter satisfies the statute-of-frauds requirement.","Yes, because the mother's promise to the uncle was oral.","Yes, because the nephew's promise to the uncle was oral.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. The statute of frauds requires that promises to answer for the debt of another be made in writing. But the memorandum sufficient to satisfy the statute needn't be written at the time of the making of the promise, nor need it be a writing addressed to the promisee. In this case, the mother's letter to her son, the nephew, satisfies the requirement of the statute of frauds. Thus, Answer B is correct, and Answer C is incorrect.

Answer A is incorrect. The amount of the loan is irrelevant here. The writing requirement arises under the suretyship provision of the statute of frauds. A person selecting this answer might be thinking of the $500 limit which may trigger a writing requirement in cases involving sales of goods under the UCC. The UCC does not apply here, since this is not a sale of goods. As to the enforceability of the mother's promise, the statute of frauds requires a writing in cases of promises to answer for the debt of another. As explained above, the letter written by the mother to her son, the nephew, is sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.

Answer D is incorrect. The issue in this case is not the enforceability of the nephew's promise, but the enforceability of the mother's promise. And even if the issue did involve the nephew's promise, there is no statute of frauds requirement that a promise to repay a debt be in writing. As to the enforceability of the mother's promise, the statute of frauds requires a writing in cases of promises to answer for the debt of another. As explained above, the letter written by the mother to her son, the nephew, is sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.","Defenses to Enforceability"
"On July 15, in a writing signed by both parties, a fixture company agreed to deliver to a druggist on August 15 five storage cabinets from inventory for a total price of $5,000 to be paid on delivery.

On August 20, the fixture company tendered the cabinets to the druggist, who refused to accept or pay for them on the ground that they were not tendered on August 15, even though they otherwise met the contract specifications.

Assuming that all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will the fixture company succeed in an action against the druggist for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because neither the July 15 agreement nor the August 1 agreement was required to be in writing.","Yes, because the August 1 agreement operated as a waiver of the August 15 delivery term.","No, because there was no consideration to support the August 1 agreement.","No, because the parol evidence rule will prevent proof of the August 1 agreement.",,,2,"Answer B is correct. A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to fulfill a duty. Under the UCC, consideration is not required for a valid waiver. When the fixture company and the druggist agreed to postpone their delivery date under the contract from August 15 to August 20, in effect the druggist waived a non-material term of the agreement and the waiver was enforceable even without consideration. The druggist, therefore, was not justified in refusing to accept or to pay for the cabinets.

A is incorrect because the July 15 agreement falls within the UCC Statute of Frauds, which requires a signed writing in order to enforce a contract for the sale of goods of $500 or more. C is incorrect because the waiver did not require consideration to be effective. D is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not apply to promises made after the adoption of a final written contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"

Pursuant to that promise, the father telephoned his old contractor-friend on May 1, 2001, and made the following oral agreement--each making full and accurate written notes thereof: The contractor was to cut 30 trees into fireplace logs from a specified portion of a certain one-acre plot owned by the father, and the father was to pay therefore $20 per tree. The contractor agreed further to build a house on the plot conforming to the specifications of Plan OP5 published by Builders, Inc. for a construction price of $18,000. The father agreed to make payments of $2,000 on the first of every month for nine months beginning August 1, 2001, upon monthly presentation of certificate by Builders, Inc. that the specifications of Plan OP5 were being met. The contractor delivered the cut logs to the father in July 2001, when he also began building the house. The father made three $2,000 payments for the work done in July, August, and September 2001, without requiring a certificate. The contractor worked through October, but no work was done from November 1, 2001, to the end of February 2002, because of bad weather, and the father made no payments during that period. The contractor did not object. On March 1, 2002, the contractor demanded payment of $2,000, but the father refused on the grounds that no construction work had been done for four months and Builders had issued no certificate.<b> The contractor thereupon abandoned work and repudiated the agreement.</b> Assuming that the <b>contractor committed a total breach on March 1, 2002</b>, what would be the probable <b>measure of the father's damages</b> in an action against the contractor for breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Restitution of the three monthly installments paid in August, September, and October.","What it would cost to get the house completed by another contractor, minus installments not yet paid to the contractor.","The difference between the market value of the partly built house, as of the time of the contractor's breach, and the market value of the house if completed according to specifications.","In addition to other legally allowable damages, an allowance for the father's mental distress if the house cannot be completed in time for his son's wedding on June 10, 2002.",,,2,"B is correct.

A is incorrect. When a party is in total breach of contract, the injured party has a right to damages based upon his expectation interest.

C is incorrect. If the father were to elect a damage recovery based upon the loss in value to him, the damages would be calculated by measuring the diminution in the market price of the property and not by measuring the expected market value if the contract had been properly completed.

"On June 1, a seller and a buyer contracted in writing for the sale and purchase of the seller's cattle ranch (a large single tract) and to close the transaction on December 1.

Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, an unequivocal statement of unwillingness or inability to perform a future contractual obligation, if material, may be treated as a total breach of that obligation and give rise to a right to immediately recover damages for that breach. In order to amount to a repudiation, however, the statement must be unequivocal; a statement that merely expresses doubt over a party's ability or willingness to perform is not sufficient. The buyer's October 1 statement to the seller that he did not intend to buy the ranch unless legally obligated to do so may have given rise to insecurity over his willingness to perform the contract, but it was not a repudiation. Nor was it a breach, since performance was not due until December 1.

A is incorrect because the buyer's statement was not a clear manifestation of a prospective unwillingness to close the contract on December 1. B is incorrect because grounds for insecurity are not alone sufficient to entitle the seller to treat the contract as breached. Although C is partially correct in that the buyer's obligation is not due until the closing date, the seller could have brought suit on October 15 if the buyer's statement had been sufficiently unequivocal to amount to a repudiation of the contract.","Performance, Breach, and Discharge"

Generally, a promise to perform a preexisting legal duty is not sufficient consideration to support a return promise. Since the man was already obligated to pay the friend $1000 at 8% interest, normally a promise to do the same would not be sufficient consideration to support the friend's promise to refrain from suit. However, the man offered to extend interest payments until December 31 in consideration for the friend's promise not to sue during the remaining time under the statute of limitations. Therefore, there was adequate consideration for the April 1 agreement, and it will provide an effective defense against the friend's claim.

B is incorrect because the man does not need to rely on detrimental reliance because there was adequate consideration for the April 1 agreement. C is incorrect because the payment of interest for six additional months is adequate consideration. D is incorrect because the April 1 agreement would provide an adequate defense against the friend's claim.","Formation of Contracts"
"An innkeeper, who had no previous experience in the motel or commercial laundry business and who knew nothing about the trade usages of either business, bought a motel and signed an agreement with a laundry company for the motel's laundry services. The agreement was for a term of one year and provided for ""daily service at $500 a week."" From their conversations during negotiation, <b>the laundry company owner knew that the innkeeper expected laundry services seven days a week</b>. When the laundry company refused to pick up the motel's laundry on two successive Sundays and indicated that it would never do so, the innkeeper canceled the agreement. The laundry company sued the innkeeper for breach of contract. At trial, clear evidence was introduced to show that in the commercial laundry business ""daily service"" did not include service on Sundays.

Is the laundry company likely to succeed in its action?",multiple-choice,"No, because the laundry company knew the meaning the innkeeper attached to ""daily service,"" and, therefore the innkeeper's meaning will control.","No, because the parties attached materially different meanings to ""daily service,"" and therefore no contract was formed.","Yes, because the parol evidence rule will not permit the innkeeper to prove the meaning she attached to ""daily service.""","Yes, because the trade usage will control the interpretation of ""daily service.""",,,1,"Answer A is correct. When parties attach significantly different meanings to the same material term, the meaning that controls is that ""attached by one of them if at the time the agreement was made . . . that party did not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knew the meaning attached by the first party."" Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 201. In this case, the innkeeper did not know, at the time of contract formation, that the laundry company attached a different meaning to the term ""daily service"" than its apparent meaning of ""every day."" Conversely, the laundry company knew the innkeeper thought he was contracting for ""every day"" service. Accordingly, the innkeeper's understanding of the term will control.

Answer B is incorrect. While it is sometimes the case that no agreement arises when parties attach significantly different meanings to the same material term, that principle is not applicable when, as here, one of the parties is aware of the meaning intended by the other. Thus, a contract was formed despite the fact that the parties attached different meanings to ""daily service."" As explained above, the laundry service knowingly attached a different meaning to ""daily service,"" and the innkeeper's understanding of the term will control.

Answer C is incorrect. The parol evidence rule is not applicable here. The apparent meaning of ""daily service"" is ""every day."" This is the meaning asserted by the innkeeper, and so it is not the innkeeper that is seeking to alter the apparent meaning of the term, but rather the laundry company. That is, to the extent that there is extrinsic evidence here, it is not being offered by the innkeeper, but rather by the laundry company. As explained above, the innkeeper's understanding of the term ""daily service"" will control.

Answer D is incorrect. While it is often the case that trade usages control the interpretation of terms in a contract, that is not true here. As explained above, the innkeeper's understanding of the term ""daily service"" will control because the laundry company knew that the innkeeper was not aware of the trade usage.","Formation of Contracts"

You may sue for the full amount because you did not receive any security from Frank under the new agreement.","D.   You may sue only for the 60 percent in the settlement agreement because Frank is insolvent and can file for bankruptcy.",,,1,"A  Creditors are often confronted with the need to renegotiate the terms of payment in response to the financial improvidence of their debtors. They are asked to reduce the obligation, to extend the period of payment, or both. The traditional view has been that even if a creditor agrees to these modifications, he is not bound by them for lack of consideration. Without an exception — a promise to change the duty (e.g., pay sooner), a dispute over the validity of the debt, reliance on the promise to forgo part of the debt, or changed circumstances that make reduction fair and equitable — this agreement is not enforceable. Even if the agreement was enforceable as an accord, Frank's failure to perform the new agreement may permit Paul to insist on full payment. Rest. 2d §281.
            Choice Ais the best answer. Choice Bis incorrect for the loan described here, but would be correct if the contract arose under article 2 of the UCC, where §2-209 permits good faith modifications without consideration. Choice Cwould be correct in some jurisdictions that are still trying to hold onto the old rule (Foaks v. Beer), but are permitting some inroads so long as the creditor gets something new to support his agreement. But choice Cis not the best answer. Choice Dis also not the best answer. It relies on a consideration — Frank's abstention from a filing in bankruptcy — that Frank did not agree to give. Nothing in the facts suggests Frank promised not to file for bankruptcy.","Formation of Contracts"
"33.  Bob sells radios. His friend and neighbor of more than ten years, Arthur, is a C.P.A. Bob puts a note in Arthur's mailbox. It reads, “You've asked me if I'll sell my '87 Volvo. I'll sell it to you for $2,000. I'll keep this offer open for two weeks.” A week later, Bob has not heard from Arthur, so he puts another note in Arthur's box. It reads, “I have to cancel my offer on the Volvo. My Toyota's transmission is gone, so I need the Volvo.” Arthur immediately knocks on Bob's door and says, “You can't go back on your offer. You said it was good for two weeks, and I want the Volvo. Here's your $2,000.” Arthur tenders a check for $2,000 to Bob and demands the car.
On these facts, if Arthur commences an action for specific performance of the transaction, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"A.   Bob will prevail because he revoked his offer for good reasons.","B.   Bob will prevail because there was no consideration for his promise to keep the offer open for two weeks.","C.   Arthur will prevail because Bob's offer was binding as an option contract.","D.   Arthur will prevail because Bob's offer was a firm offer not subject to revocation.",,,2,"B  Ordinarily, an offer is revocable by the offeror at any time. This is true even under these facts, which state that Bob's offer was “open for two weeks.” Unless the offer created an option, it remains revocable. Choice Cis wrong. Only the recitation of a purported consideration is required by the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §87(1)(a). Bob's offer, however, does not state any consideration at all for the promise to keep the offer open, but merely states the price of the car. Thus, it is not an option. Choice Dis wrong because Bob is not a merchant of cars. A written offer signed by a merchant to buy or sell goods is irrevocable without consideration for the time stated. UCC §2-205. Choice Ais wrong because Bob's reasons do not matter. If the offer created an option, it would be irrevocable despite good reasons; if not, it would be revocable even for bad reasons.","Formation of Contracts"

Coins on sale at 10 percent over their face value.” In response to this ad, Tom visited Jim's shop and saw in a display case a 50-cent coin that Tom recognized as having a value of $100. Tom tendered 55 cents to Jim, but Jim refused to sell the coin. Jim said that the coin had already been sold to Zeke for $100 prior to the start of the special sale, but that Jim had forgotten to remove it from the display case. Tom sued Jim for damages. What result is likely?</p>",multiple-choice,"A.   Jim wins because the ad was not an offer.","B.   Jim wins because 55 cents was not sufficient consideration for a coin worth $100.","C.   Tom wins because he relied on the ad in traveling to Jim's shop.","D.   Tom wins because Jim's ad was an offer that Tom accepted when he tendered the 55 cents to purchase the coin.",,,1,"A  Most mass-media advertisements are not offers to sell. Instead, they are an “invitation to the public to come and purchase.” Craft v. Elder & Johnson Co.; Rest. 2d §26, cmt. b. The rationale is that the ads rarely contain precise information on price, availability, and so on. The ad in this case was especially sketchy. It did not state what coins were being sold, the quantity of each kind of coin, or even that the special sales price applied to all the coins. Choice Ais the best answer. Choice Bis not a good answer because the law does not require adequacy of consideration. Rest. 2d §79(b). In any event, because there had never been an offer to sell the coin at any price, the parties were free to negotiate a price and Jim was free to reject Tom's offer. Choice Cis incorrect because even if Tom's reliance satisfied the requirement of consideration, it would not overcome the absence of an offer. Choice Dis wrong because, as we have seen, Jim's ad was not an offer but an invitation to Tom to come and examine Jim's merchandise.","Formation of Contracts"
"35. Questions 34-36 are based on the following fact situation:
Tom is a teacher of numismatics. He is an acknowledged expert in coins and their value. His collection is worth thousands of dollars. Tom regularly buys and sells coins. Jim, who had no prior experience with coins, inherited a sizable coin collection. Jim opened “Coin Shop” in a local shopping center.

35.  Assume that Tom telephoned Jim and learned that Jim owned 50 silver dollars minted in 1937. Jim agreed to sell them to Tom for $1,000, which sum Tom agreed to pay in advance of shipment. Following the conversation, Jim sent Tom this letter: “This confirms your purchase of 50 silver dollars. On receipt of your check for $1,000, the coins will be shipped to you as agreed. /s/ Jim.” Tom received the letter, but did not respond to it and did not pay the $1,000. A month later, Jim sued Tom, who asserted the Statute of Frauds as a defense. Will this defense succeed?",multiple-choice,"A.   No, because the letter signed by Jim satisfies the writing requirement against Tom.","B.   No, because the face value of the coins is less than $5,000.","C.   Yes, because there is no writing signed by Tom.","D.   Yes, because a memorandum signed after the contract is made does not satisfy the Statute of Frauds.",,,1,"A  The facts of this question establish that both Jim and Tom were merchants (Jim operates a coin store and Tom deals in coins). The sale of goods between merchants is covered by several special provisions of the UCC. Between merchants, if a written confirmation of the contract is sent by the seller within a reasonable time after the sale, the Statute of Frauds is satisfied unless the purchaser objects in writing within ten days after receiving the confirmation. UCC §2-201(2). Choice Ais therefore the correct answer. Choice Bis incorrect because in the absence of a transaction between merchants and in other special circumstances, the UCC requires that all sales contracts for goods at a price greater than $500 be in writing. UCC §2-201(1). Even under the 2003 revisions of article 2, which increased the threshold value to $5,000, choice Bwould be wrong. The question will not turn on the face value of the coins, but on the price of the goods. The statute would not apply because the price is less than $5,000, but the reasoning offered in this choice is incorrect. Choice Cis incorrect because the purchaser does not have to sign the memorandum. The seller's memorandum is sufficient if it is received by the purchaser and the purchaser does not object within ten days. Choice Dincorrectly states the law. The seller's memorandum covered by the UCC always follows the sale.","Formation of Contracts"

36.  Assume the same facts as in question 35. Tom defends on the ground that there was no legally sufficient consideration for his promise to pay $1,000. Will this defense succeed?",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, because a court will not enforce a promise to pay $1,000 for coins with a face value of $50.","B.   Yes, because Jim did not change his position in reliance on the promise of Tom to pay $1,000.","C.   No, because Jim's promise to sell the coins was sufficient consideration.","D.   No, because both Tom and Jim are merchants, and contracts between merchants do not require consideration.",,,3,"C  The facts of this question raise the issue of fairness in dealing between two parties to a contract. Can a party be forced to pay $1,000 for $50 in coins? The answer is yes. So long as the parties have freely agreed to the price, there is consideration. Consideration exists when the promisee gives up something of value and the promisor makes his promise in exchange. There is no requirement that the items exchanged be of equal value. The contrary view is obviously inapplicable in the kind of exchange between Jim and Tom. Who is to say that the 50 silver dollars are not worth $1,000? We leave the parties to their bargain. Choice Cis the correct answer. Choice Dis legally incorrect (contracts between merchants do require consideration). Choice Ais incorrect because it is contrary to the facts: the courts will not ordinarily question the value of consideration in a bargain between two parties.

There is a contract for Corbin to paint Farnsworth's house in exchange for $20,000, and the job must be completed within two months.","D.

The counteroffer is for $20,000 with Corbin having 2 months in which to finish the job. When Farnsworth then says he will consider the offer and inquires about different payment and completion terms, this does not serve as a rejection of the prior offer. Corbin's offer remains active. When Corbin will not agree to the new proposal from Farnsworth, the offer from Corbin can be accepted until it is rejected. The acceptance occurs prior to the rejection, so there is a contract. Choice Ais incorrect because while the last offer was rejected, the prior offer remained valid.

"38.  Joe and Bill live on the same street. One day, Joe notices a deep dent in his car door. Checking around, he notices that Carl, Bill's teenage son, has a dent in his car as well. Joe concludes that Carl struck Joe's car when he drove out of his driveway. Joe confronts Bill with his suspicions. Bill tells Joe that he will pay to have Joe's car repaired at a body shop. Joe agrees. Later that night, Bill questions Carl about the dents. Carl insists that the dent in his car occurred when he hit a pole in his employer's parking lot. He shows Bill the accident report he submitted to his employer and establishes that the dent was caused by a car with a different paint color. In the meantime, Joe takes his car to the body shop and has the dent repaired. Bill now refuses to pay for Joe's repairs.
If Joe sues Bill for the cost of the repairs, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"A.   Joe will prevail because Bill's promise is enforceable.","B.   Bill will prevail because both parties mistakenly believed Carl caused the dent.","C.   Bill will prevail for lack of consideration because Carl did not cause the dent.","D.   Bill will prevail because his agreement with Joe was oral.",,,1,"A  This question requires analysis of an agreement based on a mutual mistake concerning a basic assumption of the parties. Joe and Bill made their agreement on the mistaken assumption that Carl was responsible for the dent in Joe's door. Can Bill avoid his promises after he realizes that it was induced by a mistake? Many courts have held that in cases of mutual mistake, there is no contract at all and that either party may avoid it. The more modern view, however, is reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which will impose the obligation of performance under three circumstances: (1) the mistake must relate to a basic assumption, (2) the mistake must have a material effect on the agreement, and (3) the party seeking avoidance must not bear the risk of the mistake. Rest. 2d §152. These facts clearly revolve around a material mistake that was the underlying assumption of the agreement. The remaining issue is whether Bill bears the risk of the mistake. The answer under the Restatement would be yes. First of all, Joe relied to his detriment on Bill's promises. Second, and perhaps more important, Bill was “aware, at the time the contract was made that he had only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which his mistake related but treated his limited knowledge as sufficient.” This doctrine is called the doctrine of “conscious ignorance,” Rest. 2d §154(b), illus. 1. Thus, choice Bis wrong. Choice Cis wrong because Joe waived his claim against Carl in exchange for Bill's promise. Even if Joe's claim was invalid, waiving it will be consideration as long as Joe honestly believed it was valid at the time the contract was made. Choice Dis wrong because the agreement did not have to be in writing.",Defenses
"39.  Builder and Owner verbally agreed that Builder would install a driveway leading to Owner's garage for $5,000. The job was to be completed in one month, at which point Owner would pay Builder in full. Builder asked Jonathan to supply him with the cement he needed for $1,000. Jonathan agreed, and Builder wrote a memo to Owner, instructing him to pay $1,000 of the sum due him directly to Jonathan. Builder completed the job on schedule, but the work was defective and unacceptable to Owner. Owner refuses to pay either Builder or Jonathan.
If Jonathan sues Owner, the likely result is that",multiple-choice," A.   Jonathan will prevail even if Builder did not perform his work in a reasonably competent manner, as long as Jonathan supplied concrete in a competent manner.","B.   Owner will prevail if Builder did not perform his work in a reasonably competent way.","C.   Owner will prevail because Builder could not assign his right to payment before the work was finished.","D.   Owner will prevail because the contract involves land and there was no writing.",,,2,"B  A party to a contract may freely assign his rights under the contract. This principle makes an assignment of rights somewhat different from a delegation of duties. No consideration is required for the assignment, which operates as a present transfer. In this case, however, the delivery of cement by Jonathan constituted consideration. The assignment does not have to be in writing, but, here, Builder gave notice of the assignment to Owner. The assignment from Builder to Jonathan is a partial assignment of payment because Builder retained his rights to the balance. At common law, partial assignments were not permitted. These days, however, the courts generally allow partial assignments. The right to make a partial assignment is recognized in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. Rest. 2d §326(1). Generally, the partial assignee cannot sue the obligor without naming the assignor as co-plaintiff. In any event, the assignee “stands in the shoes of the assignor” and is subject to all the defenses, set-offs, and counterclaims that the obligor can assert against the assignor. The best answer is choice B. Because Builder did not perform his work in a reasonably competent manner, he cannot recover and Jonathan cannot recover. Choice Ais wrong because any defense Owner has against Builder will also apply to Jonathan. Builder cannot assign greater rights than it has. Choice Cis wrong because Builder could assign the right to payment at any stage in the work; however, the Owner was not required to make payment until the work was completed. Choice Dis incorrect. Although the contract relates to land, it does not involve the transfer of an interest in land. Only agreements to transfer or buy an interest in land are within the Statute of Frauds; contracts to build on or improve land are not.","Third Party Beneficiary"
"40. Questions 40-42 are based on the following fact situation:
Youth is a 17-year-old boy who has been buying and selling bicycles since he was 11. Teller is a 25-year-old bank teller who has never bought a bicycle before. Teller asked Youth if he had a bicycle to sell. Youth showed Teller a bicycle with a slight crack in the frame. Teller asked if the slight crack would impair the bicycle's utility, and Youth said, “Not a bit.” In fact, the crack would probably cause the frame to collapse after very little use. Youth knew this, but Teller did not. Teller said, “Very well, I'll pay you $100 for the bicycle and pick it up tomorrow.” They both signed a writing, prepared by Youth, which purported to memorialize the terms of their agreement. Later that day, Teller learned that the crack would probably cause the frame to collapse after little use.

40.  If Teller tells Youth he will not accept the bicycle and Youth asserts a claim against Teller for damages for breach of contract, who will prevail?",multiple-choice,"A.   Teller, because Youth is a minor and lacks capacity to contract.","B.   Teller, because he relied on a material misrepresentation.","C.   Youth, because the contract is voidable only at Youth's election.","D.   Youth, because Teller's reliance on Youth's statement was not reasonable.",,,2,"B  A party to a contract has the same defenses against the minor as against any other party. If a minor misrepresents a material fact on which the other party justifiably relies to his detriment, the latter has the option of rescinding the agreement or of asserting the defense of breach. Rest. 2d §164. Youth's misrepresentation of the condition of the bike entitles Teller to defend against Youth's claim. Choice Ais incorrect. Although persons under 18 are classified as infants in most states, an agreement by an infant is voidable by the infant but enforceable by the infant against the other party to the agreement. Rest. 2d §14. Choice Cwould be correct if Teller asserted incapacity, but this has no bearing on the defense of misrepresentation. Because Teller will raise misrepresentation, this response is not the best answer. Choice Dis incorrect because the facts indicate that Teller's reliance was reasonable. Many courts will not even inquire into the reasonableness of defendant's reliance if the plaintiff intended the misrepresentation, as is the case here.",Misrepresentation

If Youth voids the agreement, there's nothing Teller can do. Choice Bis a valid statement of the law, but it is immaterial to the issue: Youth's right to avoid the contract.

42.  Assume the writing prepared by Youth purports to describe the bicycle by serial number, but Youth mistakenly inserts serial number 100B, the number of another bicycle in his possession, instead of number 100A, the number of the bicycle at issue. At the time the writing was signed, Teller knew that the wrong serial number was contained in the writing.

The rationale is that the mistake vitiates the entire agreement. Teller will show that the bicycle described in the contract was not the one the parties intended to describe. Choice Cis the correct answer. Choice Dis incorrect because the transaction did not come within the Statute of Frauds (under UCC §2-201, only contracts for the sale of goods with an aggregate price of $500 or more are within the Statute of Frauds; the amount will increase to $5,000 or more if the 2003 revisions to article 2 are adopted). Choice Ais incorrect because mistakes that are material to the agreement can always be proved. Finally, choice Bis incorrect because the fairness of a deal is no basis to require a party to accept goods she never agreed to buy. (Note: Youth could prevail by suing for the failure to accept bicycle 100A. The parol evidence rule will not preclude evidence that the writing incorrectly recorded the parties' agreement. If clear and convincing evidence shows that the parties agreed to the bicycle with the crack in the frame, the writing can be reformed to reflect the correct serial number and enforced accordingly — subject to other defenses, such as misrepresentation.)","Contract Terms"
"43.  Seller entered into a written agreement with Buyer. Seller agreed to provide 5,000 widgets to Buyer at a price of $7,500. A few days later, Seller assigned in writing to Bradley “all of my rights under my contract with Buyer for the sale of widgets.” Bradley was another widget distributor with an excellent business reputation. The assignment did not contain an assumption by Bradley of Seller's obligations under the contract. Bradley failed to deliver the widgets to Buyer on time, and Buyer was unable to complete a job requiring the widgets.
If Buyer sues Bradley, the result will be",multiple-choice,"A.   Bradley will prevail because he never expressly agreed to assume Seller's duties under the Buyer/Seller agreement.","B.   Bradley will prevail because he was not in privity of contract with Buyer.","C.   Buyer will prevail because Buyer is a third-party beneficiary under the agreement between Seller and Bradley.","D.   Buyer will prevail because Bradley indemnified Seller.",,,1,"A  The best answer is choice A.Atransfer of one's rights under a contract is an assignment.Atransfer of one's duties under a contract is a delegation.A“general assignment” of the entire contract operates both as an assignment and a delegation. UCC §2-210(4); Rest. 2d §328(1). These facts tell us that Seller “assigned all my rights under my contract” to Bradley. This language ordinarily means both an assignment of rights and a delegation of duties. UCC §2-210(5) (UCC §2-210(3) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). But the facts also state that “the assignment did not contain an assumption by Bradley of Seller's obligations.” This negates a delegation of duties. Thus, when Bradley did not perform, he was not liable either to Seller or to Buyer. Choice Bis not as good an answer as choice A. The concept of privity is a complicated one that applies generally when there is a succession of interests between one party and another (e.g., assignor and assignee, or testator and beneficiary), or when there is a mutuality of interest in a contract or property right. If Bradley had agreed to the delegation, he would have been liable to Buyer regardless of privity, so choice Ais the better answer. Choice Cis wrong.Adelegation to Bradley would make Buyer a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Because Bradley did not promise to perform Seller's duties, there could be no third-party beneficiary of a promise. Choice Dis wrong because it is contrary to the facts.

Although Buyer is not committed to order any office furniture if he needs none, Buyer must determine his needs in good faith and cannot simply back out of the deal on a whim.

Choice Bis the best answer. Although the Buyer could have enforced the Seller's agreement even without reliance, his reliance under these facts is another reason to bind the Seller. Choice Cis wrong. Even though Buyer had no purchase or sales history, the court would impose a standard of good faith in the absence of a minimum or estimated quantity. There is nothing in the facts to indicate that Seller was unable to meet Buyer's needs, especially prior to his very first order.

Under these facts, however, the contract is sufficiently definite to satisfy the UCC requirements: it fixes the term by which the quantity is to be measured (i.e., one year), the price to be paid by Buyer (i.e., 10 percent below listed wholesale), and the commodity to be sold (i.e., office desks and chairs). Choice Bis wrong; in the absence of a “best efforts” clause, Buyer would be expected to use only reasonable efforts to sell the desks and chairs. Choice Cis wrong because it is not necessary to know Buyer's needs in advance of his orders. McMichael v. Price. Choice Dis wrong on the facts. The price was fixed at 10 percent below the Seller's quoted wholesale price. (Note: If Buyer placed no orders because it changed its mind, in good faith, about entering this new product line, no breach would occur because Buyer's needs would be zero. The cancellation would be ineffective, however, where Buyer does have orders from customers, as stated in the facts to the previous problem.)","Contract Terms"
"46.  Joe was a highly successful tire manufacturer. He sold most of his production to Rubberco. When Rubberco's requirements increased, it suggested to Joe that he expand his facilities. Joe asked ABC for a loan to finance the expansion. ABC reviewed Joe's earning records and decided it could not make the loan without a supporting guarantee. Joe asked Rubberco to act as guarantor. Rubberco called ABC, where it had a substantial account, and told the bank officer, “Don't worry, we'll be responsible for Joe's loan.” Without asking for a written guarantee, ABC made a loan to Joe of $100,000.

If Joe is unable to repay the loan, can ABC recover the loan from Rubberco?",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, if it can show that it would not have made the loan but for Rubberco's statement.","B.   Yes, because Rubberco guaranteed payment of the loan.","C.   No, because Rubberco did not guarantee the loan in writing.","D.   No, because Rubberco's words were not the language of guarantee.",,,2,"B  In the case of a guaranty given simultaneously with the creation of the debt, as in this case, there is consideration to support the guaranty — the detriment incurred by the creditor in making a loan to a debtor it would not otherwise accept. The correct answer is therefore choice B. Choice Ais incorrect because ABC does not have to prove reliance. The mere fact that Rubberco gave the guaranty will be sufficient to support its claim. Choice Cis incorrect. Ordinarily, a guaranty needs to be in writing. Rest. 2d §110(b). Because Rubberco's guaranty seems to be motivated by its own advantage (obtaining more tires from Joe), the promise falls outside the Statute of Frauds. Rest. 2d §116. Choice Dis wrong. The words “we'll be responsible for” will be given their conventional meaning of assurance or commitment, making them equivalent to the word “guaranty.”","Formation of Contracts"
"47.  Shalanda knew that Kevin was having financial trouble and that his rent was due in two days, so when she saw him buying bags of beans and rice in the store, she told him, “I will buy your entire collection of first edition Superdude comic books for $250.” Kevin responded, “You know those comics are worth ten times that much to a collector.” Shalanada said she knew “but you can't find a collector before your rent is due. Think about it and let me know. You have my cell number.” Two hours later Kevin called Shalanda and said, “Okay, I accept, although I think what you're doing is wrong. I'm insulted and I think you should be in jail for even suggesting it.” Shalanda responded, “Well if you feel that way about it, forget about it,” and hung up. Which of the following statements most likely describes the relationship between the parties?",multiple-choice,"A.   There is a bilateral contract between Kevin and Shalanda with Shalanda having an obligation to buy the comics and Kevin having an obligation to sell them.","B.   There is no contract between the parties because Shalanda revoked the offer within a reasonable time.","C.   There is no contract between the parties because promise for promise is illusory and does not constitute consideration.","D.

She permitted acceptance to take place by telephone within a reasonable time. Within a reasonable time Kevin accepted. Although Kevin's acceptance was grudging, it was sufficient to form a bilateral contract. At that point, Shalanda cannot revoke her offer. Choice Bis incorrect because after Kevin accepts the offer, a contract is formed and it is too late for Shalanda to revoke the offer. Choice Cis incorrect because a promise given in exchange for a promise is not illusory; it is the basis of a bilateral contract. Both sides have an obligation to perform. Choice Dis incorrect because Shalanda made an offer and specified the means of acceptance. Kevin complied exactly, albeit grudgingly.","Formation of Contracts"
"48. Questions 48-49 are based on the following fact situation:
Daniel and Paul were involved in an automobile accident. Paul sued Daniel for $10,000, alleging that Daniel was negligent. Each party claims to have had the green light. Of the two other witnesses, one was prepared to testify that Paul had the green light. Before trial, Daniel offered Paul $5,000 to settle all claims arising from the accident. Paul accepted the offer.

48.  After Daniel promised to pay the $5,000, Paul dismissed the negligence suit. When Daniel suffered a large business reversal and was unable to pay the $5,000, Paul threatened to sue Daniel. On learning these facts, Ted told Paul, “Daniel is an old friend of mine. If you will not sue him, I will pay you the $5,000.” Paul said, “Okay,” and did not file suit against Daniel. A week later, Ted repudiated his promise to Paul. Paul sued Ted for $5,000. What result?",multiple-choice,"A.   Ted wins because there was no consideration for his promise.","B.   Ted wins because Paul must recover against Daniel before he can sue Ted.","C.   Paul wins because his agreement not to sue Daniel is sufficient consideration for Ted's promise.","D.   Paul wins because Ted's friendship with Daniel is sufficient consideration for Ted's promise.",,,3,"C  If a party agrees not to enforce a valid claim, her promise is sufficient “detriment” to qualify as consideration. Here, when Paul agreed not to sue Daniel, he gave up his right to recover $5,000. In exchange, he received Ted's promise of payment. The fact that Paul's promise was made to Ted does not alter the result. Rest. 2d §73, illus. 11. The correct answer is choice C. Choice Dis incorrect because Ted's friendship would not be sufficient consideration in the absence of Paul's reliance. Choice Ais incorrect because, as we have seen, there was consideration for Ted's promise to Paul. Finally, choice Bis incorrect because there is no requirement that Paul sue and recover against Daniel before suing Ted. The contrary result would be economically wasteful and unreasonable.","Formation of Contracts"

Daniel and Paul were involved in an automobile accident. Paul sued Daniel for $10,000, alleging that Daniel was negligent. Each party claims to have had the green light. Of the two other witnesses, one was prepared to testify that Paul had the green light. Before trial, Daniel offered Paul $5,000 to settle all claims arising from the accident. Paul accepted the offer.

49.  Assume the same facts as in question 48, except that Ted defended on the ground of the Statute of Frauds. What result on this defense?",multiple-choice,"A.   Ted wins because his promise was to pay an amount in excess of $500 and was not evidenced by a writing signed by Ted.","B.   Ted wins because his promise was to pay the debt of another and was not evidenced by a writing signed by Ted.","C.   Paul wins because Ted's promise was not one required to be evidenced by a writing signed by Ted.","D.   Paul wins because his forbearance to sue Daniel constituted part performance.",,,3,"C  The Statute of Frauds covers suretyship agreements, promises to pay another's debt if they default. Rest. 2d §110. The agreement in question is not a suretyship agreement. Ted did not promise to perform in Daniel's place, but rather created an independent obligation: a promise to pay Paul if Paul would perform a service for Ted. The service was not to sue Daniel on the prior default. This is an independent service to Ted, despite the fact that it has the effect of erasing Daniel's debt. Thus, it does not fall within the Statute of Frauds. Thus, choice Bis incorrect. Choice Aalso is incorrect because the provision requiring a writing in contracts involving more than $500 applies only to the sale of goods. Rest. 2d §110(2)(a); UCC §2-201. Choice Dis incorrect because forbearance does not constitute part performance, and part performance may not be insufficient to establish an exception if the Statute of Frauds applied.

"50.  Nira owned a medieval sword valued around $25,000. Gillian wanted to purchase the sword, but throughout the negotiations Nira refused to lower her price below $24,000. Gillian refused to pay more than $22,000. After determining that they were at an impasse, both parties walked away from the negotiations. Two days later, Nira wrote a letter to Gillian, stating that she “feel[s] badly that we weren't able to reach a deal since our numbers were so close. How about I agree to sell it to you for $230.00?” Gillian immediately called Nira on the phone and said, “I accept your offer to sell me the sword for $230.00.” She then sent a cashier's check that Nira received but did not cash. Nira refused to cash the check or to deliver the sword. Which of the following best describes the legal relationship between Nira and Gillian?",multiple-choice,"A.   There is no contract between the parties because Gillian knew that Nira did not intend to sell the sword for $230.","B.   There is no contract between the parties because Gillian attempted to accept by telephone to a written offer, thus violating the mirror-image rule.","C.   There is a contract for Gillian to purchase the sword from Nira for $23,000.","D.   There is a contract for Gillian to purchase the sword from Nira for $230 because Gillian properly accepted Nira's offer, and any ambiguities in the contract in regard to the amount should be construed against Nira since she was the drafter.",,,1,"A  Correct. Gillian and Nira had been negotiating for the sale of the sword, appraised for $25,000 for a sale price of between $22,000 and $24,000 and negotiations broke down because neither party would budge on their figures. When Nira wrote to Gillian, referencing her regret that the parties couldn't reach an agreement even though their figures were so close, and then offered to sell the sword for $230.00, Gillian should have known that Nira meant $23,000.Areasonable person would not have thought the offer was for $230.00 and thus Gillian could not take advantage of the mistake. Bis incorrect because Nira did not state a specific and exclusive means of acceptance, and thus acceptance, had an offer been made, could have taken place by any reasonable method without violating the mirror-image rule. Cis incorrect because Gillian stated in her telephone call that she was accepting the offer to purchase the sword for $230. At best this is a counter-offer of what she knew or should have known was a $23,000 offer. Dis incorrect because Gillian could not accept since she knew or should have known of the error, and in any event ambiguities are not construed against the drafter of an offer.","Formation of Contracts"
"51.  Pubco is a publisher of travel guides. Filberts is a general bookstore. Filberts orders 5,000 copies of Travel in France at $8.50 per guide. Pubco acknowledged the sale in writing. Later, Pubco learned that Filberts does not intend to sell the guides in its store for $19.00 each (the usual domestic markup), but, instead, to sell them in Paris at $100.00 per guide. Pubco tells Filberts that the price of each guide is raised from $8.50 to $15.00. Filberts knows that it can buy the guides from a competitor at $10.00 per guide, but in its rush to fill the Paris order, it agrees to pay Pubco $15.00. Pubco ships the guides and Filberts accepts them but sends a check calculated at $8.50 per guide. On these facts, if Pubco sues Filberts, it is likely that ",multiple-choice,"A.   Filberts will prevail because Pubco secured the modification in price in bad faith.","B.   Filberts will prevail because there was no consideration for its agreement to pay the increase in price.","C.   Pubco will prevail because both parties are merchants and no consideration for the modification is necessary.","D.   Pubco will prevail because a seller is entitled to change the price if the buyer's margin of profit changes.",,,1,"A  In general, a contract between two parties cannot be modified without consideration if the modification benefits only one party. Here, the change in price would benefit Pubco but hurt Filberts.
            Because we are dealing with the sale of goods, however, the modification needs no consideration to be binding. UCC §2-209(1). But the UCC does impose restrictions that are meant to operate in circumstances like those reflected in these facts. It imposes the requirement of good faith, designed to prevent acts of extortion or duress by one party against the other. UCC §1-203. It also recognizes the courts' right to refuse to enforce a contract that is unconscionable. UCC §2-302. Under these facts, choice A is the best answer. Choice B is wrong because lack of consideration is not the central issue in these facts. If the modification had not been unfair to Filberts, it would have been enforceable without consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there is no difference between the treatment of merchants and others in the general application of the modification-without-consideration rule. The difference in treatment between the two arises only when there is a written agreement that contains a no-oral-modification clause and the merchant attempts to enforce the clause against a customer who asserts that an oral modification clause exists and should be enforced. UCC §2-209(2). Choice D is wrong because it misstates the relationship between buyer and seller and ignores the sanctity of contracts.","Formation of Contracts"
"52.&nbsp; Melissa works as a magician for children's birthday parties. She is well known for pulling a rabbit out of her hat with which the children can then play. Barbara contacted Melissa and asked if she would agree to perform her magic show at the birthday party of Aidan, her nine-year-old son. Barbara wanted to make sure Melissa would be available on January 15, 2012, before inviting Aidan's friends and classmates. Melissa, however, was a bit hard to pin down. Please indicate which statement by Melissa is most likely to be found to be an illusory promise:",multiple-choice,"A.

I will perform at the birthday party on January 15, 2012, unless I call first to let you know I have decided not to perform.",,,3,"C  This “promise” is illusory because it does not appear to place even a “good faith” obligation on Melissa. Choice A is incorrect because although there may be evidentiary and interpretation issues involved in proving the rabbit was sick on that day, unless the rabbit is medically ill Melissa is under an obligation to perform and hence the promise is not illusory. Choice B is incorrect because Melissa is under an obligation to perform unless she gets snowed in. Again, we may have evidentiary and interpretation issues about what constitutes “snowed in,” but the obligation to perform exists unless the condition occurs. Choice D is incorrect because if Melissa decides not to perform at the magic show, she still has a duty to call. She would likely be in breach if she did not do so and also did not perform.","Illusory Promise"

Homer waived his right to demand ½ rods, but he has retracted the waiver, and Carl must use ½ rods.","D.   Homer's statement, “Go ahead and use the ¼,” is not effective either as a modification or a waiver because Homer did not expressly agree to modify or waive the contract.",,,3,"C  The contract between the parties made compliance with the building specifications by Carl an express condition of Homer's promise to pay for the house. If a party manifests his willingness to waive a condition after the contract is executed, consideration is normally required for the waiver. However, courts are willing to recognize a waiver without express consideration if either the condition was not an important part of the original contract or the other party changes his position in reliance on the waiver. If the other party has not changed his position or relied on the waiver to his detriment, the waiver may be retracted so long as no consideration has been given for the waiver. Rest. 2d §84(2). Under these facts, the correct answer is choice C. Choice Ais wrong because Homer was free to retract his waiver until Carl changed his position in reliance on the waiver. Choice Bis wrong because the parties did not modify the contract in the sense that they both became bound to use of ¼ rods. Choice Dis wrong on the facts. Homer's statement would certainly have served as a waiver if Carl had purchased and installed the ¼ rods.","Waiver of Condition"

The full contract price minus the difference in cost between a 20-gallon heater and a 40-gallon heater.",,,4,"D  If the parties clearly intend a contract but omit a term, the courts will almost universally apply the term. Rest. 2d §204. Here, the parties provided for a water heater but forgot to specify the size. It will be a simple matter for the court to conclude that what was intended was a heater large enough for the house, especially since the difference in cost between the smaller and larger heater will be insignificant for a $150,000 house. Once the omitted term is supplied, it's clear that the measure of damage is exactly the difference in cost between the two heaters. Since Carl has substantially performed (i.e., built the entire house), Homer is permitted to deduct the damages resulting from Carl's failure under the agreement. The correct answer is choice D. Choice Ais incorrect because a party is not entitled to avoid an entire agreement by reason of a minor breach that can be corrected or reimbursed. Choice Bis incorrect because the court will supply the missing term. Finally, choice Cis incorrect because although Carl substantially performed he must be charged with the difference in cost to compensate Homer for Carl's breach.","Expected Damages"

Rest. 2d §228, cmt. b. However, they will also require that the architect act in good faith. Rizzolo v. Poysher. The correct answer is therefore choice B. Choice A is incorrect because the judgment of other architects is not relevant. The parties have determined between themselves whose standards they will apply. Choice C is incorrect because the court will not normally inquire into the reasonableness of the architect's judgment unless one of the parties can show that he acted in bad faith.

The auction is still 30 days off, and Piper asks Litho to correct the date and reprint the brochures. Litho replies that it will correct the error if Piper will pay an additional $1,000 “to cover the cost of paper.” Piper refuses to pay the additional sum and tells Litho that he must have delivery of the brochures “in one week” if he is to get them out in time for the sale. Piper fails to hear from Litho within the week. Desperate to get the mail out, Piper contacts Printco, which agrees to print the brochures in six days for $7,000. Two days later, Litho delivers corrected brochures to Piper and demands $5,000.

Piper will prevail and recover $2,000 plus any damages resulting from the late mailing of the brochures.","D.   Litho will prevail and recover $5,000.",,,3,"C  A buyer of goods is entitled to receive goods that conform to his requirements. If the goods are defective, he is entitled to reject them. UCC §2-601(a). The facts tell us that Litho was responsible to typeset the brochure and that the mistake in dates was material. Once the goods were rejected by Piper, Litho could remedy its breach only by correcting the error in type, reprinting the brochure, and redelivering to Piper in time to avoid any damage to Piper. Litho not only failed in this duty but also affirmatively drove Piper to “cover” by demanding an increase in price. Once a buyer rejects the goods in good faith, he may resort to the remedy of “cover” (i.e., he may purchase substitute goods from another supplier). UCC §§2-711, 2-712(1). That's exactly what Piper did here. Once a buyer has covered, she is entitled to recover as damages “the difference between the cost of cover and the contract price together with any incidental or consequential damages as hereinafter defined (Section 2-715)….” UCC §2-712(2). UCC §2-715(2) defines consequential damages in language that includes facts such as these, in that Litho had reason to know that the date of the auction was material. The best answer is therefore choice C. Piper is entitled to recover $2,000, the difference between the $5,000 contract price and the $7,000 paid to Printco, plus any consequential damages resulting from the late mailing of the brochures. Choice Ais wrong only because it doesn't recognize that Piper may be entitled to consequential damages. Choice Bis wrong because $7,000 overstates its damages.

"<div>57.&nbsp; Builder was building a three-story office building. He entered into an agreement with Seller, a window supplier, to deliver a specified number of windows “as needed” to the construction site.

Builder faxed his order for the first delivery, which was late by one day.

The correct windows were delivered the following day and accepted by Builder. Fearing further costly delays, Builder notified Seller that their agreement was canceled.</div><div>If Seller sues Builder for damages, the likely result is that</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Seller will prevail because Builder's cancellation was premature.","B.   Seller will prevail because Builder waived a claim for breach by accepting both deliveries.","C.   Builder will prevail because Seller's failure to make timely delivery and to deliver conforming goods were a material breach of the agreement.","D.   Builder will prevail because his cancellation was proper under the “perfect tender” rule.",,,1,"A  The facts deal with an installment contract between Builder and Seller providing for nine separate deliveries. Builder has a right to reject one installment only if the defect substantially impairs the value of that installment. UCC §2-612(2). The right to cancel future installments arises only if the defect in one installment “substantially impairs the value of the whole contract.” UCC §2-612(3). Here, the first installment was late, but that minor defect did not substantially impair its value. The second installment involved the wrong goods, a more serious breach, permitting rejection of that delivery. But nothing in that delivery impaired the value of future installments. Builder's fears of future defects gave it a right to demand adequate assurances of performance, but no right to cancel the entire contract at this time. UCC §2-612, cmt. 6. The correct answer is therefore choice A. Choice Bis incorrect because Builder did reject the second installment, which Seller cured the next day. The UCC will reinstate the contract if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonable notice of cancellation. Since Builder accepted Seller's cure before giving notice of cancellation, this provision probably would not apply. Choice Cmisstates the rule. Material breach is the standard under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts but not under the UCC. The question involves whether the breaches so far substantially impair the value of the future installments. No facts suggest that future installments have lost their value. In fact, Builder almost certainly still requires future windows to finish the building. Choice Dis wrong because under the UCC, the “perfect tender rule” does not apply to installment contracts.

No, because there is a possibility that Seller could buy back the property and tender a deed to Buyer on July 1.",,,2,"B  A party to a contract may by his conduct indicate that he does not intend to perform the terms of the contract. In these circumstances, the party will be deemed to have committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract. The other party to the agreement may then cancel his own performance and may generally institute a suit for damages even before his performance is due. Here, Seller's conduct in conveying title to a third party before July 1 was a clear and voluntary repudiation of his contract with Buyer. Rest. 2d §250(b). The correct answer is choice B.

No, because Seller might retract his repudiation before July 1.",,,2,"B  An anticipatory repudiation can occur either as a result of a party's conduct or by his unequivocal statement that he will not perform. In either case, the other party may commence an action for breach of contract immediately. And he does not have to ask for assurances of performance if the repudiating party's statement is unambiguous, as it is here. When Seller advised Buyer that the home would not be conveyed, Seller's conduct constituted a clear and voluntary anticipatory repudiation. Choice A is incorrect because an anticipatory repudiation can be marked by a clear and unequivocal statement that the party is unwilling to perform, without any further action. Choice C is incorrect because when an anticipatory repudiation has occurred, the aggrieved party can commence an action even though the date for performance has not yet arrived. Finally, choice D is incorrect because the aggrieved party may commence an action immediately; she does not have to wait to see if the other party really means what he says.","Anticipatory Repudiation"

Yes, because payment of the price by Buyer was a condition subsequent to Seller's duty to tender the deed.",,,1,"A  If the promised performances of both parties to a contract canoccur at the same time, the courts will normally require that they be performed simultaneously. The performances are then said to be conditions of each other, or concurrent conditions. Each party is expected to be ready to perform at the time designated. Normally, he manifests this by tendering his performance. The concept is used especially in contracts relating to the sale of goods and of land. Rest. 2d §234(1). Buyer's tender of payment is sufficient to establish readiness to perform on his part. The correct answer is choice A. Choice Bis incorrect because Buyer need only show an ability or readiness to perform by tendering payment (it would obviously be incongruous to require actual payment). Choice Cis incorrect. Buyer is required to tenderperformance (i.e., payment) to show that he has the ability to perform. Seller need not deliver a deed if Buyer is unprepared or unwilling to perform. Choice Dis wrong. Land contracts and title closings are the primary example of transactions involving the requirement of simultaneous performance, not alternating and dependent performances.",Performance
"61.&nbsp; On January 15, 2012, Mahica enters into a contract with Rosana in which Mahica agrees to babysit Rosana's two children on January 20, 2012, in return for $20 per hour. At the time they entered into the transaction, at Mahica's request, Rosana pays Mahica $100 for the five hours of babysitting that will take place the next day. On January 20, 2012, while babysitting, Mahica calls Rosana in good faith and explains that because both children have colds, and because it is so much more work to take care of two sick children than two healthy children, she thinks Rosana should pay her $25 per hour. Rosana agrees it is more difficult and agrees to pay the additional money. That said, when Rosana returns home after being gone for five hours, she refuses to pay Mahica the additional money.

Mahica will prevail because the babysitting contract was properly modified because of unanticipated circumstances.","C.   Rosana will prevail because the original babysitting contract could not be modified and Mahica provided no new consideration.","D.   Rosana will prevail because the babysitting job was no harder than either party reasonably expected.",,,3,"C  At common law, in order to overcome the pre-existing legal duty rule, modification without consideration requires (1) a voluntary agreement, (2) performance not to have been completed by either side, (3) unanticipated circumstances, and (4) that the modification be fair and equitable. Here, while the agreement is voluntary, due to unanticipated circumstances and fair and equitable, performance by Rosana has already taken place through the advance payment. Choice A is incorrect because good faith is the standard for a modification under the UCC. Here, babysitting is a service and the common law prevails. Choice B is incorrect because the agreement could not be modified without consideration if full performance has taken place on either side. Here, payment in full constitutes full performance of Rosanna's duties. Choice D is incorrect because both parties were in agreement that the job was harder than expected, but still the contract could not be modified absent new consideration.","Performance & Modification of Contract"
"<div>62.&nbsp; Bob owns a small shopping mall in Eureka. One winter's day, there is a big snowfall and the sidewalk and parking area are soon covered with snow. Bob sends his maintenance crew out to shovel the snow. Because he thinks that the law of Eureka requires him to clear both the sidewalk and the parking area, he tells his men to clear both. It's getting dark and the men clear both areas as well as they can in the dim light. Sally Smith walks on the sidewalk, slips on a piece of ice and breaks her leg. Also under the belief that Bob is responsible to clear the sidewalk, Sally threatens to sue Bob, who is uninsured. He agrees to pay Sally's medical bills. Sally's bills come to $15,000 and Bob refuses to pay her. He consults his lawyer, who advises him that the law in his state places the responsibility for clearing sidewalks on the municipality, not the property owner.

Sally will prevail because Bob's promise was binding and enforceable.",,,4,"D  Sally honestly believed that she had a legal claim against Bob. She was wrong. Nonetheless, her agreement not to press the claim would be valid consideration for Bob's promise to pay her medical bills. Choice C is incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the agreement did not have to be in writing. Choice B is plausible. The existence of consideration will not negate a defense of mutual mistake. The mistake involved here is a mistake not of fact but of law (both parties believed that the applicable law made the property owner responsible to clear snow and ice from the sidewalk). Originally, courts would not afford relief to a party claiming a mistake of law. The modern view, however, is to treat a mistake in law in the same way as any other mistake, on the theory that a mistake of law is “part of the total state of facts at that time.” Rest. 2d §151, cmt. b. This defense, however, cannot apply to settlement contracts. Uncertainty over who might prevail (either on the law or the facts) is one risk the settlement resolves. No settlement would be secure if a party could avoid the contract by pleading a mistake of fact or law pertaining to the merits of the claim or defense justified rescission. Rather, mistake applies when a mistake of law (say, a zoning ordinance) materially affects the underlying consideration (say, a land sale). It is not pertinent to mistakes concerning who is right in litigation.",Consideration
"<div>63.&nbsp; Builder was hired to reconstruct a garage behind Owner's home. The agreement was in writing. After the work was completed, Owner claimed a $2,000 adjustment because the siding used by Builder was wood and not vinyl as specified in the contract. The Builder argued that wood was longer lasting and easier to maintain, and that, if anything, Owner owed him an adjustment. Their disagreement remained unresolved until Owner learned that Builder was a fellow lodge member. He called Builder and said, “Let's call it quits.” Builder submitted a written release that Owner signed and delivered. Now Owner has learned that Builder is not a lodge brother after all.

Builder will prevail because the release is enforceable against Owner, who signed it.","D.   Builder will prevail because the release was evidence that Owner no longer claimed an adjustment.",,,3,"C  Parties to a commercial agreement often argue over the quality or scope of performance by one of the parties. To encourage settlement of these disputes, the courts will generally enforce a general release of claims given by one party to the other. This practice is recognized by the UCC. UCC §1-107 (UCC §1-306 under the 2001 revisions to article 1). Choice A is therefore incorrect: No consideration was necessary for the execution of Owner's release. However, these facts confront us with a more difficult issue: Can the party executing the release reassert his claim if the release was given under a mistake or misunderstanding? When the relationship is a commercial one, the answer is no. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Jardel Co. The result may be different when the relationship is noncommercial, as in the case of a release from a personal injury plaintiff to an insurance company. The correct answer is choice C. Because this was a commercial transaction, Owner cannot avoid his release because he gave it to Builder on the mistaken impression that Builder was a lodge fellow. In any event, this is probably not the kind of mistake that would justify redress to Owner. The mistake did not relate to the underlying contract or transaction but to an extraneous and collateral fact. Choice B is therefore incorrect. Choice D is wrong because it states a conclusion that is contrary to the facts.","Enforceable Contract"

You can sue for the reasonable value of the car but not the principal of the note.","D.   You can sue in the alternative for payment of the note or payment of the reasonable value of the car.",,,4,"D  The best answer is choice D. However, under an alternative interpretation of the facts, the best answer would be choice C. The solution depends on whether we are dealing with an accord and satisfaction or with a substituted agreement. In an accord and satisfaction, one party offers and the other accepts a substitute performance in the future in discharge of an existing obligation. The promise is called an executory accord. Here, the executory accord was Orville's promise to convey title to his station wagon.
            If an executory accord is made, no discharge occurs until the new terms are performed. In the meantime, the old debt or obligation is not discharged. If neither the old debt nor the promised accord is performed or satisfied, the other party has an option: he may sue on either the original obligation or on the promised accord. Rest. 2d §281. In a substituted agreement, the parties agree that the old obligation will be discharged and a new one substituted. If the substituted agreement is not performed, the aggrieved party can sue only on the new promise, not the old one. Rest. 2d §279(2). Whether a particular transaction is an accord and satisfaction or a substituted agreement depends on the intent of the parties. Here, the agreement looks, feels, and smells more like an accord and satisfaction than a substituted agreement, so we prefer choice D to choice C, which would be the correct answer if we had a substituted agreement. Choice A is wrong under either theory: A substitute would wipe out the debt, not the car; an accord would not wipe out either one. Choice B is wrong because Bradford cannot recover both, but must choose one or the other, even under an accord.","Substituted Agreement"

The contract stated that Barney would buy Sampson's store for $125,000 “provided Barney finds a purchaser who will buy his present business for $100,000.” Prior to signing the agreement, the parties had a conversation during which they agreed that because Barney would need the money, Barney's buyer would have to pay all cash.

Yes, because Barney's promise to buy was subject to a condition within Barney's complete control and was therefore illusory.","B.   Yes, because Barney's promise to buy was still executory."," C.   No, because the court will interpret the condition of Barney's promise as requiring Barney to make a good faith effort to find a buyer for his present business."," D.   No, because Barney's promise to sell his present business was consideration for Sampson's promise to sell his business to Barney.",,,3,"C  If a promise is conditioned on the occurrence of an event that is within the exclusive or partial control of one party, most modern courts will imply an obligation on the part of the promisor to use his best efforts to make the event happen. Barney must make at least a good faith effort to locate a purchaser for his business. If he fails to do so, Sampson can successfully assert a breach of contract claim. Choice C is the right answer. Choice D is not the best answer, although it correctly states that a promise contingent on the occurrence of some event will satisfy the requirement of consideration. Choice C is a better answer than choice D because even though we find consideration, we must subsequently analyze what effect Barney's unwillingness to find a buyer would have on Sampson's promise. Choice A is incorrect because the court will read into the condition (because it is within Barney's control) the obligation to use his best efforts to find a buyer. Choice B is not correct.

I'm sorry, I tried to find an all-cash buyer as we agreed orally, but no one has come forward.

Barney wins if the judge decides that the written agreement was a partial integration of the parties' agreement.",,,4,"D  The parties to a written agreement usually engage in extensive oral discussions and negotiations before they sign the agreement. Once the agreement is signed, the parol evidence rule operates to exclude any evidence of these oral discussions that differ from the writing. The assumption is that the written agreement represents the final expression of the parties' intent. If it does, the agreement is deemed a total integration. If, on the other hand, the agreement is not intended to include all the details of their agreement, the agreement is deemed a partial integration. In the latter case, evidence of a prior oral understanding may be admitted if it does not contradict a term of the agreement. The judge, not the jury, will usually determine whether the agreement is a partial or total integration. The best answer on these facts is choice D. If the judge decides the agreement was a partial integration — a logical conclusion when we consider that the writing specified only a total price without dealing with the distribution of the price between cash and mortgage — then Barney will be able to introduce the oral understanding and win. Choice C is wrong because a decision that the agreement was a partial integration is not helpful to Sampson's case. Choice A is wrong because it offers only an objective test of whether we are dealing with a total integration or a partial integration. The issue to be resolved is the intent of the parties, and that can be determined only by the judge after hearing the evidence. Choice B is wrong for the same reason. (Note: Two other theories, not offered in any of the answers, might be tried. One argues that the agreement should be re-formed to include the condition that Barney's business be sold entirely for cash. The other argues that the agreement, though totally integrated, was conditioned on an event that did not occur. The theory is weak because the condition was included in the writing. Thus, arguing that the entire writing became effective only if the condition occurred is less persuasive.)","Parol Evidence Rule"

Without the modification, the written agreement would be unconscionable.","D.   The evidence is offered to establish a constructive condition to Barney's performance of the agreement.",,,3,"C  Under these facts, Barney's best argument is probably that the agreement as written is unconscionable. The courts will not enforce an agreement that is so one-sided as to be essentially unfair. Both the Restatement (Second) of Contracts and the UCC make provision for rejection of an unconscionable agreement. Rest. 2d §208; UCC §2-302(1). Several facts make performance of this agreement by Barney unfair: (1) He is being forced to sell an existing business; (2) he has to move to a new city; (3) he has to pay more for Sampson's business than his own business is worth; (4) Sampson is the one who has failed to negotiate a new lease; and (5) he has no assurance that his new business will be allowed to remain in its present location, or, indeed, be able to find a new location. Under these circumstances, the court can easily help Barney to be relieved of his bad bargain by re-forming the agreement to conform to the oral modification. Gianni Sport Ltd. v. Gantos. Choice B is arguably as good an answer. Most oral modifications of written agreements will be enforced without consideration, but there is always the risk that the court will insist on some showing of consideration, especially where the contract as written contains no reference to Sampson's lease. Choice A is wrong because there is no ambiguity in the writing as described. Choice D is not the best answer. Under some circumstances, the court will impose a condition as a matter of law to ensure fairness. However, constructive conditions are not normally used to impose new terms on the parties.",Defenses

She refused to pay Jack. After much argument, Jack agreed that he would wait for payment for 12 months. In the meantime, he would water and feed the trees regularly to make sure they lived through the year. After two months, Jack agreed to do all the landscaping for a large local golf course and stopped looking after Jill's trees.</div><div>What result if Jack sues Jill?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.

Jack will recover $10,000, less the cost to Jill of maintaining the trees for the balance of the year.","D.   Jack will recover nothing because he breached the compromise agreement.",,,2,"B  The best answer is choice B. The facts we are given show only that the parties had a dispute and that they resolved their dispute in a modification that involved two basic ingredients: a promise by Jack to perform additional services in caring for the trees, and his agreement to wait for payment until the end of the year. These facts create neither an accord and satisfaction (i.e., an agreement to give a new performance in exchange for an old one) nor a substituted agreement (i.e., an agreement to perform a different duty in satisfaction of an existing one), but simply the modification of an existing contract by a change in terms.Amodification of an existing contract is enforceable without consideration even if it benefits only one party. UCC §2-209(1). Under these facts, Jill could reasonably ask for the modification to which Jack agreed. Because one of the modifications was a delay in payment for a period of one year, Jack's suit is premature. If, however, Jill repudiated the contract, choice Bwould not be correct. Choice Ais wrong because the original agreement was not supplanted. We do not have a substituted agreement, but the modification of an existing one. In addition, the modification did not eliminate Jack's right to compensation, but merely delayed it for a year. Choice Cis wrong because we cannot measure Jack's remedy at this time. If the trees do not survive, Jack may recover nothing. If they all survive, Jack's failure to water them may cause no damage to Jill. If only some of them survive, his recovery will have to be calculated. Choice Dis an arguable answer, but it is not as good as choice B. Even though Jack has not performed the modifications, his failure may not be material. If all the trees survive after one year despite Jack's failure to perform the modifications, he will probably be entitled to the agreed price of $10,000.",Remedies

Send a copy of the agreement to Parfumco and ask it to reconfirm the terms.","D.   Write to Parfumco demanding assurances of its ability to perform.",,,4,"D  An “assignment of rights and obligations” operates both as an assignment and a delegation. An assignment is a transfer of rights; a delegation is a transfer of duties. UCC §2-210(5) (UCC §2-210(3) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). Here, Scents transferred both to Parfumco. All contract rights are assignable unless the assignment materially increases the risks to the obligor, in this case, Aroma. Rest. 2d §317(2). The facts here involve a requirements contract: Aroma contracted with Scents for all its oils for a period of one year. Before the UCC, requirements contracts were not assignable. The UCC now recognizes such assignments under the proper circumstances. UCC §§2-306(1), 2-210(2) (UCC §2-210(1)(a) under the 2003 revisions to article 2).
            The assignment from Scents to Parfumco was therefore valid without the consent or acknowledgment of Aroma. Choice Ais not the best answer because there is no inherent right in the obligor to prevent an assignment. Choice Bis wrong for essentially the same reason. Scents had a right to assign and did not breach the agreement with Aroma by assigning; the agreement did not contain a no-assignment clause, and prohibitions against assignment are frowned on anyway. If Aroma suspects that Parfumco cannot or will not perform as well as Scents and that the risks to it will be increased unacceptably, it can ask for assurances because the assignment is coupled with a delegation. UCC §§2-210(5), 2-609 (UCC §2-210(2)(c) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). Failure of Parfumco to give adequate assurances will entitle Aroma to cancel the agreement.

At the end of the second month, it receives a notice from Iris Nurseries, its source of live flowers, advising OSI that Iris must suspend all deliveries because of a storm that has wiped out its flower beds. OSI can get the flowers from a nursery in Holland for $7,500 per month more than it would pay Iris. At that price, OSI will lose $7,500 per month, a loss that may cause it to fail. OSI notifies Peckendorf that it cannot make any further deliveries without an increase of $9,000 per month. Peckendorf refuses to adjust the contract, and OSI makes no further deliveries.

Peckendorf will prevail because OSI breached the agreement.","D.   OSI will prevail because the loss to it was extreme and unforeseeable.",,,4,"D  The facts illustrate the difference between two types of circumstances, each of which can operate to relieve a party from performing the terms of a contract. The first arises when the contract calls for delivery of particular goods and the goods are destroyed. When this happens, the contract is discharged if the goods are essential to the contract. On these facts, we have to ask two questions: Were the live flowers essential to the contract? And were flowers from Iris the subject matter of the contract? The answer to the first question is yes, but the answer to the second question has to be no. The flowers from Iris were not the subject matter of the contract. The contract did not specify a particular source for the flowers. Many suppliers have live flowers, and OSI's duty was not to deliver the Iris flowers, but to deliver live flowers from any reasonable source. UCC §2-615. Choice Bis therefore wrong. The other circumstance that will relieve a party of its duty to perform is impracticability.
            Impracticability is akin to impossibility, but different enough to suggest a different result in this case. It was not impossible for OSI to perform, but it was impracticable (i.e., performance would be too costly and might jeopardize OSI's very existence). The modern view is to permit discharge under these circumstances. The cost increase must be extreme, must not be foreseeable, and must not be implicit in the contract. Rest. 2d §261, cmt. d; UCC §2-615. The increase in price may not be enough by itself to justify discharge, but the threat to OSI's very existence probably is. Choice Dis the best answer.

On final inspection, Homeowner's architect advises him that some of the material on the roof of the garage does not meet local requirements. The cost to remove and replace the material is $4,000.

Contractor will recover nothing until he has removed and replaced the defective material.",,,2,"B  These facts involve a dispute between the two parties over the completion of a building contract. The issue is the measure of damages following a dispute over performance. Because we are told that an architect has certified a defect in performance, we have to conclude that the defect did occur and that Contractor was in breach. Unless the breach is material, Contractor can recover on the contract, but the balance due will be offset by any damages the breach caused Homeowner. (If the breach was material, Homeowner might elect to cancel the contract, in which case Contractor could not sue on the contract, but must instead recover in quasi-contract for the fair market value of the services performed, less any damages to Homeowner.) Because the breach does not seem to be material, the measure of damage is the contract price, less the damages for defendant's breach. If the architect's estimate is correct, Contractor's recovery will be $7,000, the difference between the contract price and the cost to Homeowner of replacing the wrong material. Choice Ais wrong because it does not compensate Homeowner for the cost of correcting Contractor's breach. Choice Cis wrong because the result would be to confer a windfall on Homeowner. Choice Dis wrong. The defect here is a breach of Contractor's duty, not the failure of a condition. Unless the breach is material, which it does not appear to be, Homeowner must perform and seek damages rather than withhold performance.",Remedies
"<div>72.  On December 20, Carl, owner of Carl's Coffee Shop, entered into a written contract with Dan, owner of Dan's Doughnut Factory, under which Carl agreed to purchase his doughnut requirements from Dan for the next calendar year.

He tells you that if he sells the materials, he will recover only $30,000, but if he finishes the yacht, he is likely to sell it for $120,000. He asks you for your advice as to the course of action that will put him in the best position to recover his losses from Roland.</div><div><br></div><div>What should you advise Harpo?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Sell the materials and sue Roland for expectation damages.","B.   Sell the materials and sue Roland for reliance damages.","C.   Sell the materials and sue Roland in restitution.","D.   Build and sell the yacht and sue Roland for consequential damages.",,,1,"A  As Harpo's attorney, your responsibility is not only to guide him to the maximum possible recovery but also to prevent him from actions that may ultimately work to his disadvantage or detriment. Choice D is the only choice that contemplates the completion of the yacht in an effort to improve Harpo's position. It is a course of action that is covered under the UCC. UCC §§2-703, 2-704(2). The UCC recognizes the right of a reasonable seller to complete the manufacture of an article and resell it in the event of a breach by the buyer. However, under these facts, which tell us that construction has not begun and that the resale price is purely speculative, it would not be advisable for Harpo to proceed with construction. Choice Dis not the best answer. The other three choices all anticipate that Harpo will sell the materials for $30,000 and sue Roland for damages. What is the best measure of his damages? Choice Cis not the best answer. Restitution is available only when the plaintiff has performed a part of the contract and conferred some benefit on the defendant. In other words, the plaintiff's restitution interest is the value to the defendant of the plaintiff's performance. Rest. 2d §370. Here, Roland has received no benefit, and restitution is not the best theory to proceed on. Choice Bis incorrect because the UCC does not provide a separate remedy based on reliance. Both UCC §§2-706 and 2-708 (the basic remedies for repudiation) start by allowing buyer to recover the contract price, then subtract resale price (here, salvage value) and costs saved (here, the expense of finishing construction of the yacht). This at least will include recovery for expenses, but allows (almost requires) Harpo to try to prove that a profit would have remained after accounting for savings. Rather than give up now, Harpo should try to prove expenses. Choice Ais the best answer. It may be difficult to prove how much Harpo saved by not completing the yacht (since construction has not begun, it is almost impossible to calculate all of Harpo's costs at this time). Still, Harpo has the cost projections he used to compute the price, which serve as some basis for proving savings. Harpo's profit is somewhat speculative. Still, choice Acomports best with the damage formulations allowable under the UCC and with Harpo's best interests.",Remedies
"74.  Subdivider has received approval to subdivide a plot in Hiawatha County and to build ten two-story colonial houses. All the houses are exactly the same except for minor details in exterior decoration. He contracts with Builder to build all ten houses at a total cost of $750,000. Subdivider pays $150,000 to Builder on execution of the contract and an additional $10,000 on satisfactory completion of each house. Builder completes five houses and is paid $50,000. Subdivider and Builder have a violent argument, and Subdivider throws Builder off the job. Builder says, “You owe me $375,000 for five houses and you've paid me $200,000. Please give me a check for $175,000.” Subdivider replies, “I won't pay you anything until I build the other five houses and see how much they cost me.” Builder retains you, and you ask your associate to write you a memo outlining the best theory on which to sue. What theory is your associate most likely to recommend?",multiple-choice,"A.   Material breach by Subdivider.","B.   Divisibility of contract.","C.   Promissory estoppel.","D.   Quantum meruit.",,,1,"A  Because the associate's assignment is to construe the facts in a way that will be most beneficial to Builder, the best answer is choice A. We know that Subdivider threw Builder off the job. Unless excused by a Builder's breach or nonoccurrence of a condition, Subdivider's conduct breaches the contract. It would be hard to argue the breach was not material because it completely severed all remaining duties. Material breach may allow Builder to recover more than $375,000. Damages would be the contract price ($750,000) minus any costs saved (by not building the remaining five houses). Unless costs of construction on the last five houses will exceed $375,000, this remedy exceeds recovery on a severability theory. Choice Bis tenable. Construction contracts are often divisible (i.e., they can be divided logically into a series of separate contracts in which services are performed in stages in exchange for payments of money). Rest. 2d §240. Not all construction contracts are divisible, but this contract would seem to qualify. The houses are all the same, the price for each is the same and is separately identifiable, and the event that triggers payment — the satisfactory completion of each house — is clearly stated. If we rely on the theory of divisibility, Builder will be likely to recover the $175,000 he asked for. Choice Bwould be the best answer if facts suggested either that Subdivider was justified in throwing Builder off the job or that finishing the work would cost Builder more than $375,000. Choice C, promissory estoppel, is not the best theory to rely on. It is applied generally in situations in which one party relies to her detriment on another's promise and is usually used as a substitute for consideration. Rest. 2d §90(1). It is not applied in bilateral contracts in which the rights and obligations of each party are clearly stated. Choice Dis not the best answer. Quantum meruit is used in those cases in which the plaintiff has failed to give all the performance that was required by the contract, but has given a measure of performance that has conferred some value or benefit on the defendant. The plaintiff is allowed to recover the reasonable value of the benefit. The fair market value of the homes might be less than the contract price and certainly won't include the profit on the remaining five houses. The doctrine is not appropriate here because, at this point, Builder has given a measure of performance that can easily and reasonably be translated into Subdivider's obligation to pay a measurable sum.","Third Party Beneficiary"

The parties were concerned merely about supplying lodging to Delwood. They did not intend to confer on the Harriot the right to benefit from their promise. The Harriot is the incidental beneficiary of their agreement, not the intended one. The correct answer is choice D. Since the Harriot is not the intended beneficiary, choices A, B, and Care all wrong. Kiwanis intended no greater benefit to Harriot than to any other hotel that might lodge Delwood.

Zippro's annual production is 300,000, but it has the plant capacity to gear up, and it agrees in writing to supply all of Fabrico's needs for ten years as proposed by Fabrico.

Fabrico will prevail because Zippro could have delivered 200,000 zippers to Fabrico and the balance of its production to Skisuit.",,,4,"D  The best answer is choice D. The contract between Fabrico and Zippro is a fairly typical output and requirements contract. These contracts are covered under UCC §2-306. Because no specific quantities are set forth, the UCC imposes the requirement that the parties act in good faith to ensure a reasonably foreseeable and constant quantity. The facts tell us that Fabrico treats Zippro as its exclusive source. This commitment by Fabrico acts as the consideration for Zippro's promise to meet Fabrico's needs and imposes on Zippro the obligation to deal with Fabrico in good faith. See Eastern Airlines Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp. Because Fabrico was a good, loyal, and constant customer for three years, Zippro did not act in good faith when it cut Fabrico off completely and prevented it from getting any zippers. The decline in Fabrico's needs was caused not by any action on its part but by the intrusion of a stronger competitor. Zippro's actions were especially egregious when you consider that it preferred Skisuit to Fabrico. Zippro could easily have served all the needs of Fabrico and some of the needs of Skisuit. Choice Ais wrong because the facts tell us that Zippro did not expand its facilities, but merely geared up to full capacity. Choice Bis wrong because Zippro could have sold to Skisuit without cutting Fabrico off entirely. Choice Cis plausible if 200,000 zippers is disproportionate to the prior year's orders and that difference constitutes a material breach. (The perfect tender rule applies to buyers, not sellers. UCC §2-601.) On the facts, the orders may be disproportionately small, permitting Zippro to recover damages for the breach, if any.

Sue and Mark have exchanged a series of invitations, offers, and counteroffers. When Sue offered to perform for $20,000 and Mark “accepted her terms,” they reached agreement on price, dates, and roles, but Sue's insistence on a written contract “for my approval” obviously confirmed her need to be sure that other possible terms — that is, the identity of the conductor, the names of other members of the cast, her hotel accommodations — would be acceptable to her.

Nothing, because the contract required pruning of two trees.","C.   $150, as the reasonable value of his services.","D.   $350, as the difference between the contract price and the cost of completion.",,,3,"C  The critical issue on these facts is whether in pruning only one of two trees, Felix committed a material breach of the contract or whether he had substantially performed the contract. Under some circumstances, it is not easy to determine whether the performance is substantial. If the performance is substantial, the party giving the performance is entitled to recover on the contract — that is, sue for his expectation damages, which are, in this case, the contract price less a setoff for defendant's damages. The defendant's damages will be measured by the cost of remedying plaintiff's default. Under those circumstances, choice Dmight be correct. But pruning one tree may not be substantial performance of the contract. The question is a close one because the work was easily divisible into two equal parts. Arguably, Felix could recover $250 for the half of the contract he completed, though this choice was not offered as an answer. For two reasons, it seems Felix did not substantially perform: (1) Felix walked off the job and should be charged with the default; and (2) the value of his work can be assessed by the cost imposed on Oscar to remedy his default ($150), given that the two trees were identical and, thus, pruning one would be no different from pruning the other. The most equitable result is to limit Felix to recover under quasi-contract in quantum meruit. This is the appropriate remedy when the plaintiff has materially breached the contract, but has given the defendant part performance that is of value to the defendant. In that case, the plaintiff will be limited to the reasonable value of his work. This is especially true in construction cases. Since the reasonable value of Felix's work can be readily measured by the cost of Murray's work, the correct answer is choice C. Choice Dis not the right answer because, as we have seen, Felix is not entitled to his expectation damages because he materially breached the contract. Choice Ais probably not the right answer, but it is a close call. Many courts will not allow any recovery to a plaintiff who has committed a “willful” default, which may be the case on these facts. Rest. 2d §374. Choice Bis wrong for the same reason that choice Ais wrong. Having performed some valuable services, it would be unjust to allow Oscar to keep the services without any compensation to Felix.",Performance
"<div>85.  Albert sold his used Alfa Romeo to Bart for $7,000. They agreed that $3,000 would be paid on transfer of title and the remaining $4,000 “in 30 days.” Bart knew that he would be unable to pay the balance. He said to his friend Otto, “Look, I need to pay $4,000 to Albert in 30 days. You need your house painted. If I paint your house, will you pay $4,000 to Albert?” Otto replied, “That sounds look a good deal to me. I agree.” Bart diligently and efficiently painted Otto's house, but Otto now refuses to pay Albert. Albert sues both Bart and Otto. What result? </div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Albert can recover against Bart but not against Otto.","B.   Albert can recover against Otto but not against Bart.","C.   Albert can recover against both Otto and Bart.","D.   Albert cannot recover against either Otto or Bart until Bart sues and recovers a judgment against Otto.",,,3,"C  When Otto agreed to pay $4,000 to Albert in exchange for Bart's painting of Otto's house, Albert became the third-party beneficiary of Otto's promise. Under the common law, a third-party beneficiary could not sue because he was considered not to be “in privity” with the promisor — in this case, Otto. Even the first Restatement allowed a third-party beneficiary to sue only if she was either a creditor beneficiary or a donee beneficiary. As now revised, the Restatement has eliminated these two classes of beneficiary and has created two new ones — intended beneficiaries (who can sue) and incidental beneficiaries (who cannot). Here, Albert is clearly the intended beneficiary of the agreement between Bart and Otto. (See Rest. 2d, Chapter 14 Introductory Note, for a history of the beneficiary concept.) Rest. 2d §302(1). An intended beneficiary has the right to sue to enforce the promisee's promise. The choices here raise the issue: which one of the parties may he sue? May he sue both? The third-party beneficiary may certainly sue the promisor, who, in this case, has received value for his promise. May he also sue the promisee? The majority view is that he may. Rest. 2d §310(1). Of course, he is entitled to one satisfaction of his claim. Rest. 2d §310(2). The best answer is therefore choice C. Albert may recover against both Bart and Otto, so long as he collects only $4,000 from either or both. Choice Ais wrong because Albert is not limited to a suit against Bart. Choice Bis wrong because he is not limited to a suit against Otto. Choice Dis wrong because the intended beneficiary may initiate a suit in his own name and does not have to wait for the promisee (Bart) to recover against the promisor (Otto).",Consideration
"<div>86.  Maples, Inc., a distributor of trees and shrubs in the Northeast, enters into a five-year contract with Viburnum Corp., a grower of shrubs, to supply Maples with all its requirements of viburnums and hollies for five years. Viburnums and hollies represent 35 percent of Maples's business and 75 percent of Viburnum's business. There is no mention in the contract of the right of either party to assign. The parties enjoy a model relationship for the first two years. In the third year, Maples receives an irresistible offer for its business and sells all its assets to Poplar Nurseries, the nation's largest distributor of plants. Among the assets assigned is the contract with Viburnum. Viburnum is concerned that Poplar's requirements will be too much for it to handle and that Poplar will be slower to pay its invoices than Maples.</div><div><br></div><div>It notifies Maples and Poplar that it will not honor the assignment and will not sell to Poplar. In its notice, it states, “We bought the credit, payment record, and requirements of Maples. We do not believe that Poplar will be able to pay our invoices on time or that we can satisfy Poplar's needs.” To satisfy its needs for viburnums and hollies, Poplar goes into the market and is unable to find another grower with the production capacity of Viburnum. Poplar sues Viburnum for damages and for specific performance. What result?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Poplar will recover damages but not an order of specific performance.","B.   Poplar will recover both damages and an order of specific performance.","C.   Viburnum will prevail because the contract is not assignable.","D.   Viburnum will prevail unless Poplar can prove that its credit is as good as Maples's and its requirements about the same.",,,2,"B  The modern view is that all contracts are assignable, except under circumstances that would make the assignment inherently unfair to the obligor, such as by increasing the burden or risk to the promisor. UCC §2-210(2) (UCC §2-210(1)(a) under the 2003 revisions of article 2). Here, Viburnum expressed two concerns: (1) that Poplar may have greater demands than Maples and (2) that Poplar may not pay as quickly as Maples. The UCC protects Viburnum from excessive demands by limiting the quantity Poplar can require to an amount reasonably proportionate to the amounts Maples demanded in the past. UCC §2-306(1). Viburnum may refuse to fill excessive demands, but may not refuse to fill demands within the range demanded by Maples. The UCC protects Viburnum from the second concern by allowing it to demand adequate assurances that Poplar will perform the contract. UCC §2-210(5) (UCC §2-210(2)(c) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). If Poplar fails to provide adequate assurance, Viburnum then may have a right to terminate the contract based on an implied repudiation by Poplar. UCC §2-609. Neither potential problem seems to justify an immediate termination of the contract. No breach by Maples or Poplar justifies that preemptive move. If specific performance prevents all of Poplar's damages, it may not receive both remedies. However, choice Bremains the best answer because some damages might occur before the court orders specific performance. Choice Ais incorrect. Even if Viburnum's performance is not unique, other appropriate circumstances may justify specific performance, including a shortage of the goods. Poplar's inability to find another supplier suggests that a shortage exists. Choice Cis plausible if the court refuses to enforce the assignment because facts essential to the original agreement are no longer applicable. Crane Ice Cream Co. v. Terminal Freezing & Heating Co. Choice Dis wrong because Poplar need not establish the similarities to prevail. Rather, the assignment will be presumed effective. Viburnum may resist excessive requirements or poor credit under the UCC, but may not reject the assignment based on unsubstantiated fears that these might arise.",Assignments

Maxwell will prevail because he accepted Sunset's offer and was forced to pay more than the special Sunset rates.","D.   Sunset will prevail because, as a former guest, Maxwell should have known that Sunset had a limited number of rooms.",,,2,"B  The best answer is choice B. The letter sent by Sunset Hotel was not an offer but an invitation to reserve its accommodations for a specific weekend. Offers by hotels, airlines, cruise ships, theatrical performances, sports events, and other similar attractions are understood by everyone to include the condition of limited availability. In this sense, they fall into the category of offers controlled by “trade usage.” Trade usage is defined in the UCC as “any practice … having such regularity in a … trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.” UCC §1-205(2). Since the hotel notified Maxwell that it was sold out (i.e., rejected his offer) and did not confirm his reservation (i.e., accept his offer), there was no contract. Choice Ais wrong because it assumes the hotel made an offer. If the hotel had made an offer, Maxwell's method of acceptance probably would be deemed reasonable, certainly more reasonable than just showing up and attempting to register and use the room! Choice Cis wrong because Sunset did not make an offer that Maxwell was empowered to accept. Choice Dis not the best answer because, although it states the facts correctly, Maxwell's knowledge would make no difference if, in fact, the hotel's letter had been an offer. The hotel can limit the offer to first come, first served, but its failure to do so would come at its own risk, not Maxwell's.","Offer and Acceptance"

Yes, because Farnsworth's telephone call was a repudiation.","B.   Yes, if Jones interpreted Farnsworth's telephone call as a repudiation.","C.   No, because Farnsworth's telephone call did not constitute a repudiation.","D.   No, because a repudiation must be in writing to be given effect.",,,3,"C  The call was not a repudiation for two reasons. First, it did not unequivocally state that Farnsworth would not perform starting February 1, but simply expressed the possibility that he would be unprepared to begin until February 10. Repudiation requires an unequivocal statement that the party will commit a breach. Rest. 2d §250(a). Second, the breach threatened was not material. Rather, Farnsworth's statement at most suggested he would miss 10 days on a 24-month (730-day) contract. While Jones would be entitled to damages for the breach, the breach is not sufficiently material to justify termination of the entire contract. Thus, no cause of action for total breach would arise, as required under Rest. 2d §250(a). Choice Ais wrong for these two reasons: The statement was equivocal, and the breach was not material. Choice Bis wrong because the only unequivocal statements count as repudiation. No matter how reasonable Jones's interpretation may have seemed, uncertainty must be resolved by recourse to a request for adequate assurances of performance, not by assuming the words in fact signal a breach when they did not clearly so state. Rest. 2d §251. (If this case arose under the 2003 revisions to article 2 of the UCC, choice Bmight be correct. That rule defines repudiation to include “language that a reasonable person would interpret to mean that the other party will not or cannot make a performance still due under the contract,” and does not expressly require that the threatened breach be material. UCC §2-610(2).) Choice Dis wrong because nothing requires that a repudiation be in writing. It may be accomplished orally or by deed.","Contract Formation"

No, because Jones was not materially prejudiced by Farnsworth's failure to appear on February 1.","D.   No, because Farnsworth notified Jones of his delay in a timely fashion.",,,3,"C  The issue presented by these facts is as follows: Did Farnsworth's failure to appear on February 1 constitute a material breach entitling Jones to cancel the contract and sue for damages? It's not always easy to decide if a breach is material. The courts resort to several tests: How much has the aggrieved party been damaged? What is the essence of the contract? Can the aggrieved party be compensated adequately? What is the relationship in value between the defaulted performance and the balance of the contract? How extensive is the delay? Was the breach willful? Can the aggrieved party make other arrangements? On these facts, it's hard to see how Farnsworth's breach can be deemed material. He had a two-year contract. His failure to appear was not willful (though evidence that he could have returned earlier but willfully remained in China might negate this). He suggested a temporary placement. He kept his promise to appear on the 10th. The best answer is therefore choice C. Jones, however, would have the right to set off against Farnsworth's salary any damages resulting from his delay in appearing. Choice Ais incorrect as a matter of law; only a material breach, not just any breach, will justify terminating the contract. Choice Bis wrong because Farnsworth's breach was not material, and Jones can be adequately compensated for his damage. Choice Dis wrong.

No, because Farnsworth was not permanently injured.","D.   No, because Farnsworth's disability established an impracticability defense.",,,4,"D  If the death or illness of a party makes performance impracticable, that party is excused, at least for the duration of the disability. Farnsworth's injuries were severe enough to relieve him of his responsibility to appear and entitle Jones to seek a replacement. However, because the contract was for two years and the period of injury was only two months, the contract was discharged only partially and could be enforced anew by either party once Farnsworth was able to sing again. Since Farnsworth's performance was excused, he is not responsible to reimburse Jones for the additional fees paid to Young. The correct answer is choice D. Choice Ais not correct. It's immaterial to the outcome whether Jones was responsible in any way. Choice Bis incorrect on the facts.

To award him these costs is to put him back in the same position as if Farnsworth had not breached. Rest. 2d §347. The correct answer ischoice B. Jones is entitled to damages for all of February because that month has passed, and to the present value of the excess costs in future months.

Terry logged on to Shelly's Web site, clicked on the goods she wanted, filled in the quantity (100), and went to the checkout screen. That screen showed the total price and asked Terry to select shipping terms. As a special that week, Shelly's site offered free standard shipping (which the Web page said would arrive in seven to ten business days via a ground delivery service). Expedited shipping would have cost at least $300 on an order this size, so Terry elected the free shipping. Terry gave credit card information for the payment and then clicked to confirm the order.

Terry will prevail because the confirmation e-mail from Shelly's Web site accepted Terry's offer in writing.",,,4,"D*  The analysis will differ depending on whether the 2003 revisions to article 2 have been enacted. In either case, however, each of Shelly's defenses should fail, leaving Terry with an enforceable contract. Choice Awould be correct if no acceptance occurred before Shelly sent the e-mail informing Terry that the goods were backordered. The electronic confirmation, however, seems to be an acceptance. Even if it will not serve as a writing, it can satisfy the requirement of assent. Choice Acould be correct if choice Cwere correct — in which case, choice Cwould be a better answer because it negates acceptance by itself, without regard to any other answer. Choice Cis incorrect because Shelly can authorize any agent she wishes to respond for her. The computer confirmed the order under program instructions she supplied (or hired another to supply). Her failure to consider each offer consciously is no defense. (Shelly would not want it to be a defense if Terry, rather than Shelly, tried to cancel the order after confirmation. Shelly probably sends e-mails only when problems arise. If so, none of her customers get a human acceptance in the normal course, which could leave Shelly without any enforceable rights.) The revisions to article 2 codify the ability of electronic agents to bind a party. UCC §2-204(4) (2003 revisions). Choice Bis incorrect under the 2003 revisions for two reasons. First, the Statute of Frauds applies to sales of $5,000 or more, but the sale here is only $2,000. Second, the statute requires a signed “record,” not a signed “writing.” UCC §2-201(1) (2003 revisions).Arecord includes “information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.” UCC §2-103(1)(m) (2003 revisions). Thus, the e-mail confirmation would satisfy the Statute of Frauds if signed. The signature requirement under the UCC is quite minimal — any symbol, such as initials or a logo, may suffice. UCC §§2-103(1)(p) (2003 revisions), 1-201(39) (original), 1-201(37) (2001 revisions). As long as the e-mail confirmation includes the company name, it seems likely to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. *Choice Bpresents a much closer case under the unrevised UCC, and may in fact be a better answer. The statute required a writing, which was defined as reducing the information to tangible form. An e-mail is not a tangible form and thus not a writing.Acourt may refuse to get caught up in these niceties, recognizing that the purposes of the statute are fully satisfied by an e-mail that can be printed out. Indeed, if Shelly printed out a copy of the e-mail, that would be a writing, even if the printout was never sent to Terry.

The terms and conditions, therefore, do not change anything. The confirmation accepted the offer before any counteroffer or rejection was received by Terry. Choice A, therefore, is factually correct, but legally irrelevant. Choice Cis wrong because Terry probably is bound by the terms and conditions. Although some Web sites force users to scroll through all the terms to reach a button labeled “I agree” before they will consummate the transaction, nothing in the law requires this practice. The claim that the terms and conditions should not apply to Terry is no more persuasive than a claim that someone who signed a written agreement without reading it should be excused from the terms of the writing because of his own neglect. *Choice Bremains a plausible choice under the UCC as it exists today, but will be incorrect if states adopt the 2003 revisions to article 2.","Offer and Acceptance"
"95. Questions 93-97 are based on the following fact situation:<div>Shelly sells candles over the Internet. Terry purchased a scented candle from Shelly's Web site. The candle was so good that Terry decided to purchase a large supply, in part to avoid running out, in part to give as gifts, and in part to sell at her booth in a local farmer's market. Terry logged on to Shelly's Web site, clicked on the goods she wanted, filled in the quantity (100), and went to the checkout screen. That screen showed the total price and asked Terry to select shipping terms. As a special that week, Shelly's site offered free standard shipping (which the Web page said would arrive in seven to ten business days via a ground delivery service). Expedited shipping would have cost at least $300 on an order this size, so Terry elected the free shipping. Terry gave credit card information for the payment and then clicked to confirm the order. A final page appeared with all the information Terry had supplied (quantity, price, delivery, credit card, billing and shipping address, etc.). It asked Terry to review the page and confirm the information, and to then click a button to submit the order. Terry clicked the confirmation button without reviewing the information. The Web site gave Terry a confirmation number and e-mailed a confirmation of the receipt of her order, promising a second e-mail when it had been shipped. All of these messages were generated automatically by the Web engine running the page; no human being saw the order until the next day.</div><div><br></div><div><div>95.  Consider the general facts, but not the specific facts of the preceding two problems. Immediately after submitting the order, it dawned on Terry that there were too many zeros in the numbers just confirmed: The order was for 1,000 candles, not 100, for a price of $20,000, not $2,000. She immediately clicked “Contact Us” and e-mailed a revocation of the offer, explaining that she intended to order 100 candles, not 1,000. Just after she clicked “Send,” she heard the sound announcing incoming mail. Opening her inbox, Terry saw the confirmation of a 1,000 candle order from Shelly's Web site. Assume Terry's e-mail, sent from Shelly's Web site to Shelly's Web site, arrived immediately in Shelly's inbox, but that no one checked the e-mail until the next morning. Shelly's acceptance was dispatched almost immediately after Terry submitted the order, but Terry's computer checked for e-mail only every 20 minutes, so the confirmation probably was dispatched before Terry sent the e-mail canceling the order (as the time stamps on the messages confirm), even though it arrived after Terry sent the e-mail. If Shelly has enough candles and wants to enforce Terry's order, what is the likely result?</div></div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Shelly will prevail because the acceptance was dispatched before the revocation was dispatched.","B.   Terry will prevail because the revocation was received before the acceptance was received.","C.   Shelly will prevail because the acceptance was dispatched before the revocation was received.","D.   Terry will prevail because the revocation was dispatched before the acceptance was received.",,,3,"C  The mailbox rule applies to e-mail.A revocation is effective on receipt at a place the other party designated for its delivery. Thus, Terry's revocation was effective the moment Shelly received the e-mail — which the question says is the same moment she sent the e-mail. But an acceptance is effective from the time it is dispatched. Because Shelly's Web site dispatched the acceptance before Terry's revocation was received, the contract was formed at that moment. Choice Ais incorrect as a statement of law because the important time for revocation is the time of receipt, not the time of dispatch. Because dispatch and receipt were simultaneous, it describes the facts well enough, but is not as good as choice C, which accurately states the rule. Choice Bwould be correct if the mailbox rule did not apply. Even though no one read the message until morning, it was received when it arrived in Shelly's inbox — the place designated for such communications. Rest. 2d §68. Without the mailbox rule, all communications are effective on receipt. The rule, however, is not limited to snail mail, but makes any acceptance effective once it leaves the offeree's possession. Rest. 2d §63. Choice Dis factually accurate but irrelevant under the legal rule.","Contract Formation"

The contract is not enforceable for lack of a writing.","B.   The contract should be rescinded for unilateral mistake.","C.   The contract should be reformed for mistake of integration.","D.   The contract is unconscionable.",,,1,"A*  The Statute of Frauds is Terry's best hope (until and unless the 2003 revisions to the UCC become law). Terry's order and e-mail are both electronic, not in tangible form. They do not satisfy the requirement of writing under the existing law. While a court may decide to treat them as writings anyway because they serve most of the same functions, a court that scrupulously follows the language of the UCC will not enforce the contract against Terry. *Choice Bis a plausible answer and would be a better answer if the 2003 revisions to article 2 become law. Once courts recognize an electronic record as sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, Terry's reliance on the Statute of Frauds will fail. Unilateral mistake is hard to apply to these facts, but might work. The quantity was a basic assumption; it has a material effect on the exchange (Terry would need to pay ten times the price expected, though Terry would also receive ten times as much in return). The risk of mistake is not allocated to Terry by the agreement — though a review of the unread terms and conditions would be required to confirm this. Conscious ignorance might allocate the risk to Terry: Terry knew she had not reviewed the final confirmation carefully but submitted the order anyway. But perhaps this was mere negligence on Terry's part, not conscious ignorance. Finally, the deal may have been too good to be true, putting Shelly on notice that Terry was mistaken. This may depend on how often Shelly gets other orders of this size. Choice Cis incorrect because reformation corrects a writing to reflect the agreement the parties actually made, not the agreement one of them wished she had made. This is not a case where the parties agreed on 100, but the writing erroneously said 1,000. Shelly agreed to sell 1,000 candles, the only number in the record at the time Shelly accepted. Unilateral mistake justifies reformation when the other party commits fraud or nondisclosure. No such misconduct applies to Shelly here. While canceling the order might be plausible, reforming it to 100 would be unusual. Choice Dis incorrect. Nothing in the facts suggests that the deal is unfair; the candles seem to be worth the price, and free shipping on an order this large makes the deal even better. The terms were not concealed from Terry. In fact, the terms to which Terry objects were terms typed in by Terry, not terms Shelly imposed on Terry. No basis for unconscionability exists.","Contract Formation"

Shelly bills Terry's credit card and ships 1,000 candles. Shelly was busy and decided to ship the order in ten boxes, each containing 100 candles, sent over a period of several days. (This allowed Shelly to do other work, instead of focusing on Terry's order exclusively for an extended period.) Terry received the first box of 100 candles eight business days after the order was placed and accepted delivery. On the ninth business day, one more box arrived. Terry accepted the box, but e-mailed Shelly for instructions on how to return the double shipment. On the tenth business day, no boxes arrived, but Shelly's reply e-mail alerted Terry, for the first time, to the mistake in the order. On the eleventh business day, the other eight boxes arrived. Terry rejected the boxes. If Terry claims that late delivery justifies rejection of the candles, will Terry prevail?</div></div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, Terry can reject the eight late boxes because late delivery is a defect within the perfect tender rule, but must keep the two boxes already accepted.","B.   Yes, Terry can reject all ten boxes because late delivery is a defect within the perfect tender rule and allows rejection of the entire shipment, not just the portion that was late.","C.   No, because this was an installment contract and the one-day delay did not substantially impair the value of either this shipment or the entire contract.","D.   No, because the goods delivered were not defective in any way, just late.",,,2,"B  Under the perfect tender rule, any defect in delivery permits the buyer to reject the whole, accept the whole, or reject any commercial unit and reject the rest. UCC §2-601. The failure to deliver 1,000 candles within ten business days fails to conform to the contract, permitting Terry to resort to this section. Choice Ais incorrect in that it implies Terry can reject only the portion that was late. Even though Terry accepted the first two boxes, that happened before the breach occurred (i.e., before any right to reject arose). The breach creates a right that Terry can exercise as to the whole shipment (or only the nine boxes Terry didn't intend to order) at Terry's option. Choice Cis a correct statement of the law, but does not apply to this case. Terry did not order candles to be shipped in installments (say, 100 per month). Terry placed a single order for 1,000 candles, all due at the same time. Shelly's decision, for her own convenience, to ship the ten boxes at different times does not convert a single order into an installment contract. If shipment in a single lot (not a single box, but one lot with all ten boxes) was constrained by external factors, not just Shelly's own convenience, Shelly might argue that these circumstances authorized shipment in lots. UCC §2-307. If so, this would be an installment contract as defined in UCC §2-612(1) and choice Cwould be correct. Choice Dis incorrect because the perfect tender rule applies to any failure to conform to the contract, not just defects in the goods themselves. (Note: If Shelly could argue that the contract did not require delivery within seven to ten business days, she might prevail on the ground that no breach occurred. The estimate of delivery might not be deemed a promise. The default UCC term would fix delivery when Shelly put the boxes in the hands of the carrier. UCC §2-308(a). In this case, choice D, though not phrased with this position in mind, would be the best answer. Because the parties' negotiations mentioned the delivery time, it seems likely this became an express term, overriding the UCC's default term.)",Remedies
"<div>98.  Sean, a wholesale food salesman, phoned Compco to order a laptop computer. Compco's sales agent discussed the configuration Sean wanted and quoted a price, including the special discounts available that week. Sean agreed to that price. Compco took Sean's credit card information and said the computer would arrive in five business days. Compco billed Sean's credit card when it shipped the computer. When the computer arrived (on time), Sean opened the box and began setting up the machine, discarding various papers that were inside the box. Among these papers was one labeled “Terms of Sale.” This paper said that all sales were subject to the terms on that page. The lengthy terms included provisions limiting Sean's remedy for breach of warranty to repair or replacement, at Compco's option, and excluding any consequential damages that result from breach. The Terms of Sale also specified that if the buyer was unwilling to be bound by these terms, it should return the computer to Compco within 30 days for a full refund, including shipping both ways. Sean kept the computer more than 30 days. Sean then went on a business trip with the laptop, but was unable to use the wireless connections anyplace. Ultimately, Compco determined that the integrated wireless function was defective and replaced the laptop with one that worked. In the meantime, Sean lost considerable time trying to make the wireless work and can point to at least two business opportunities lost as a result of the defective wireless. Under the UCC, if Sean seeks damages against Compco, will the limited remedies in Compco's Terms of Sale be enforceable against Sean?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   No, the Terms of Sale, though accepted by Sean, never became part of the contract because the modification lacked consideration.","B.   Yes, the Terms of Sale were a counteroffer, which Sean accepted by keeping the computer instead of returning it within 30 days.","C.   Yes, the Terms of Sale were proposals to modify the contract, which Sean accepted by keeping the computer instead of returning it within 30 days.","D.   No, the Terms of Sale were proposals to modify the contract, which Sean never accepted.",,,4,"D*  The contract formed on the phone — computer for price — was complete in itself. Both parties performed it: Sean paid, and Compco shipped the goods. Subsequent negotiations could modify it, but neither party can be compelled to accept different terms if they prefer to retain the terms of the original contract. Compco's record included with the computer was not part of the terms mentioned on the phone, but proposed additional or different terms. (Compco could have demanded these terms if the salesperson had noted, before the agreement was final, that all sales were subject to terms and conditions contained in the box. Sean could not accept an offer without those terms if Compco's offer included those terms, at least by reference.) Because Sean is not a merchant of computers, proposals to modify the contract will not be accepted by silence, but require express assent. UCC §2-207(2) (deleted in the 2003 revisions of article 2). The same result would be reached under revised UCC §2-207. The new terms were not part of the records of both parties nor part of the default provisions under the code. Unless assent by Sean was found, they would not become part of the transaction. Choice Ais incorrect because modification under the UCC does not require consideration if made in good faith. UCC §2-209. Sean might question good faith here: Nothing changed after the phone call to make the new terms more important than before. Sean should have more success challenging the acceptance of the modified terms. *Choice Bis incorrect because the phone conversation between the parties stated a complete agreement. There would be no basis for either party to challenge the enforceability of the terms reached at that time. Nonetheless, at least one prominent court has concluded that sales of this type are not final during the phone conversation, even though payment occurs at that time. Rather, the offer consists of shipping the goods, which the consumer has an option to accept after reviewing the terms in the box. Keeping the goods then signals acceptance. See Hill v. Gateway 2000. So far, other courts have not adopted this reasoning. Choice Cis wrong because Sean's conduct is ambiguous. Keeping the computer could express assent, if Sean so intended. Rest. 2d §69(1)(b). But silence also could express rejection of the modification and a decision to keep the computer under the terms of the original contract. Compco cannot force Sean to relinquish the original contract right (to keep the computer) as the only way to reject the modification.","Contract Formation"
"<div>99.  On the facts of the preceding problem, if the Terms of Sale do not limit Sean's remedy, is Sean likely to recover consequential damages for the lost sales?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, because a computer seller should foresee business use of a laptop will occur in the ordinary course of events.","B.   Yes, but only if Sean informed Compco while ordering the computer of his needs, including the need for wireless access for business purposes.","C.   No, because the lost sales were easily avoided by buying a dial-up cord and accessing the Internet that way.","D.   No, because the losses were not foreseeable by Compco at the time of contract formation, even if they were fully aware of Sean's business uses.",,,2,"B  The UCC permits recovery of “any loss resulting from the general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.” UCC §2-715(2)(a). If Sean made known his requirements for the computer, including the need for wireless access, then losses resulting from seller's failure to meet these needs seem to fall within the definition. Choice Ais incorrect. Not all (nor perhaps most) laptop buyers use them for business, especially in a way that would produce losses if wireless access were interrupted for a few days. Just because some do does not mean that Compco should foresee these losses without notice. Such a general foreseeability requirement would virtually eliminate this restriction on consequential damages. Choice Cis incorrect, or at best depends on facts not in the question. Dial-up may not fully substitute for wireless access. It requires a phone line, which might not always be available while traveling. It also is significantly slower than wireless, which may make it less effective. Although dial-up might have avoided these losses, that is not certain on these facts. Choice Dis incorrect. Notice to the seller would lay the groundwork for consequential damages, as long as the notice was sufficiently detailed. The precise nature of what Sean would need to reveal may be subject to some debate: is it enough that Compco know Sean conducts transactions via computer, or would Sean need to reveal specific deals and the amount of potential losses in each to give sufficient notice? But, at some point, full disclosure would satisfy the requirements of the UCC.",Remedies
