"A defendant was driving his automobile at a legal speed in a residential zone.  A child darted out in front of him and was run over and killed before the defendant could prevent it.  The defendant's driver's license had expired three months previously; the defendant had neglected to check when it was due to expire.  Driving without a valid license is a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction.  On a charge of manslaughter, the defendant should be found",multiple-choice,"guilty under the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule.","guilty, because the licensing requirements are to protect life, and failure to obey is negligence.","not guilty, because the offense was not the proximate cause of the death.","not guilty, because there was no criminal intent.",3,"The correct answer is C. For the defendant to be found guilty of manslaughter, a proximate cause between the illegal act and the resulting death of the victim must exist. This causation must be more than simple cause-in-fact; it must be somehow foreseeable from the illegal action taken. In this case, the fact the defendant did not possess a valid license was not a causal factor in the death of the child.<br /><br /> Answer A is incorrect. The common law misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, while permitting the prosecution of involuntary manslaughter for misdemeanor offenses, still requires that there be a proximate cause between the illegal action and death. Answer B is incorrect. While the licensing requirements may be to protect life, criminal liability for manslaughter requires more than simple negligence, but also proximate cause. Finally, answer D is incorrect; manslaughter does not require that the defendant have any criminal intent to commit an offense. Recklessness is sufficient. The lack of the foreseeability between driving without a license and the death of the child shows the lack of proximate cause.",Homicide
"A husband and wife were walking to their car one evening after having seen a movie.  As they were passing a dark alleyway, the defendant leaped out brandishing a gun.  He pushed the wife against the wall of a nearby building, held the gun to her head, and demanded money from the husband.  The husband handed over his cash.  The defendant grabbed the cash and ran away.",multiple-choice,"Robbery of the husband","Larceny from the husband.","Assault on the husband and wife.","Assault on the wife.",1,"The correct answer is A. The most serious offense that the defendant may be convicted of is robbery of the husband. Robbery is the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. In this question, the defendant, having the clear intent to deprive the husband of his money, used the threat of force against the wife to obtain the property. The threatened force need not be toward the owner of the property; it may also be toward another party. Answer A is the most serious offense listed and is correct.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because it is less serious than the robbery and would be merged into the robbery charge. Answer C is incorrect because it is less serious than the robbery charge, and the assault on the husband would merge into the robbery charge. Answer D is incorrect because it is less serious than the robbery charge. Although the defendant committed all of the listed offenses, robbery is the most serious offense.<br />","Theft Crimes"
"Despondent over losing his job, a businessman drank all night at a bar.  While driving home, he noticed a car following him and, in his intoxicated state, concluded he was being followed by robbers.  In fact, a police car was following him on suspicion of drunk driving.  In his effort to get away, the businessman sped through a stop sign and struck and killed a pedestrian.  He was arrested by the police.<br /><br />The businessman is prosecuted for manslaughter. He should be",multiple-choice,"acquitted, because he honestly believed he faced an imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury.","acquitted, because his intoxication prevented him from appreciating the risk he created.","convicted, because he acted recklessly and in fact was in no danger.","convicted, because he acted recklessly and his apprehension of danger was not reasonable.",4,"The correct answer is D.  The businessman should be convicted of manslaughter because he recklessly caused the death of a human being, and he has no valid self-defense claim.  The businessman is charged with manslaughter, which is the killing of another person without malice aforethought.  He did recklessly kill another person by driving while intoxicated and speeding through a stop sign.  The businessman's claim of self-defense will fail because his belief that he was acting in self-defense was not reasonable.<br /><br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because, to successfully raise a self-defense claim, the businessman must not only believe that he faced an imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, but also that belief must be reasonable. The businessman's apprehension of danger was unreasonable on its face, so he cannot make a proper self-defense claim. Answer B is incorrect because the businessman did not need to appreciate the risk he was creating to be found guilty of manslaughter. In addition, his voluntary intoxication was one of the reasons for his recklessness and will not serve as a defense. Answer C is incorrect because a proper claim of self-defense does not require that the person actually be in danger, but rather that the person reasonably believe he is in danger, even if it is not true. Since the businessman's belief that he was acting in self-defense was unreasonable, and because he recklessly killed another human being, he should be convicted of manslaughter.",Homicide
"A husband decided to kill his wife by poisoning her.  He asked his friend, a pharmacist, to obtain some Curare, a deadly poison, and to give it to him without recording the transaction.  Because the pharmacist suspected the husband's motive, she supplied the husband with a small quantity of Marvane, an antibiotic, instead of Curare.  Marvane is harmless if administered in small quantities, except for the less than 1 percent of the population who are allergic to the drug.  The husband injected his wife with Marvane while she slept.  She was allergic to the drug and died from the injection.  The pharmacist was distraught and confessed the entire affair to the police, explaining that she had failed to report the husband's conduct to the authorities because she feared that it would end their friendship if she did.<br /><br />In a common-law jurisdiction, the husband is guilty of",multiple-choice,"murder only.","murder and conspiracy.","attempted murder only.","attempted murder and conspiracy.",1,"The correct answer is A.  Murder is causing the death of a human being with malice aforethought.  The husband, with the intent to kill his wife, poisoned her, which was an immediate, actual, and proximate cause of her death.  Although the wife's death was, unknown to the husband, unlikely, the husband's actions did cause her death, and he did so intentionally and with malice aforethought.  The husband is guilty of murder.",Homicide
"An employee decided to kill his boss after she told him that he would be fired if his work did not improve.  The employee knew his boss was scheduled to go on a business trip on Monday morning.  On Sunday morning, the employee went to the company parking garage and put a bomb in the company car that his boss usually drove.  The bomb was wired to go off when the car engine started.  The employee then left town.  At 5 a.m. Monday, the employee, after driving all night, was overcome with remorse and had a change of heart.  He called the security officer on duty at the company and told him about the bomb.  The security officer said he would take care of the matter.  An hour later, the officer put a note on the boss's desk telling her of the message.  He then looked at the car but could not see any signs of a bomb.  He printed a sign saying, ""DO NOT USE THIS CAR,"" put it on the windshield, and went to call the police.  Before the police arrived, a company vice president got into the car and started the engine.  The bomb went off, killing her.<br /><br />The jurisdiction defines murder in the first degree as any homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation or any murder in the commission of a common-law felony.  Second-degree murder is defined as all other murder at common law.  Manslaughter is defined by the common law.<br /><br />The employee is guilty of",multiple-choice," murder in the first degree, because, with premeditation and deliberation, he killed whoever would start the car.","murder in the second degree, because he had no intention of killing the company vice president.","manslaughter, because at the time of the explosion, he had no intent to kill, and the death of the company vice president was in part the fault of the security officer.","only attempted murder of his boss, because the death of the company vice president was the result of the security officer's negligence.",1,"The correct answer is A.  The employee, with premeditation and deliberation, caused the company vice president's death.  Although his intent was to kill his boss, the doctrine of transferred intent will presume that intent to go with whomever started the vehicle.<br /><br /><br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the employee had the requisite intent to kill, and the requisite premeditation and deliberation, and that intent is transferred to the person who started the car.  Although the employee did not intend to kill the company vice president in particular, he is guilty of first degree murder.<br /><br /><br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because, although at the precise moment the company vice president was killed, the employee did not have the intent to kill anyone, when he took the actions that led to the vice president's death, he did have the intent to kill.  The employee cannot escape liability for murder merely because he changed his mind after he set the murder in motion.  Regardless of the employee's attempt to stop anyone from using the vehicle, he will still bear criminal responsibility for originally placing the bomb in the vehicle with the intent to murder his boss.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect because the security officer's failure to save the company vice president's life is not an intervening act that would negate the employee's responsibility in causing the vice president's death.  It was completely foreseeable that someone other than the boss would be killed as a result of the employee's actions, and the security guard's failure to stop the company vice president will not negate the employee's guilt.  Therefore, the employee is guilty of first degree murder.",Homicide
"An inventor, believing that a woman suffered from arthritis, told her that for $100 he could cure her with a device he had invented.  The device was a large box with a series of electric light bulbs along the sides.  The woman, after examining the device, agreed to take the treatment, which consisted of placing her hands inside the box for several ten-minute periods.  The woman gave the inventor $100 and went through the treatment.<br /><br />The inventor is charged with obtaining money by false pretenses.  Each of the following, if true, will absolve the inventor of guilt for obtaining money by false pretenses <br /><br />EXCEPT<br />",multiple-choice," A. The inventor honestly believed that the device would cure arthritis, but his belief was unreasonable."," B. The woman honestly believed that the device would cure arthritis, but her belief was unreasonable."," C. The inventor was playing a practical joke on the woman and intended to return the money."," D. The woman was an undercover police officer and did not believe that the device would cure arthritis.",2,"The correct answer is B.  At common law, false pretenses is defined as obtaining possession and title of another's property through fraud or misrepresentation while intending to steal the property.  B is correct because a victim's unreasonable belief is not an element of false pretenses.  Hence, the woman's unreasonable belief in the inventor's false statement will not absolve the inventor of false pretenses.<br /><br /><br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because if the inventor thought his device cured arthritis, he did not knowingly mislead the woman and is not guilty of false pretenses.  Answer C is incorrect because if the inventor did not intend to steal the woman's money, he is not guilty of false pretenses.  Answer D is incorrect because if the inventor did not deceive the woman into relinquishing the property, the inventor is not guilty of false pretenses.<br /><br />","Other Crimes"
"While browsing in a clothing store, a defendant decided to take a purse without paying for it.  She placed the purse under her coat and took a couple of steps toward the exit.  She then realized that a sensor tag on the purse would set off an alarm.  She placed the purse near the counter from which she had removed it.<br /><br />The defendant has committed",multiple-choice," A. no crime, because the purse was never removed from the store."," B. no crime, because she withdrew from her criminal enterprise."," C. only attempted larceny, because she intended to take the purse out of the store."," D. larceny, because she took the purse from its original location and concealed it with the intent to steal.",4,"The correct answer is D.  Larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property.  The defendant took the purse and concealed it under her coat with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the purse.  Therefore, the defendant committed larceny.<br /><br /><br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the defendant does not need to leave the premises to commit larceny; taking the purse and concealing it with the intent to deprive the owner is sufficient.  Answer B is incorrect because withdrawal is a defense to criminal liability involving co-conspirators but does not apply after the offense has been committed.  Although the defendant quickly changed her mind, she still moved and concealed the property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it and thus committed the offense of larceny.  Answer C is incorrect because the defendant committed more than attempted larceny, she committed larceny.  She took, and hid, the property of another with the intent to deprive the owner of it.  Larceny punishes the taking of property with the intent to steal, even if the defendant does not travel very far with it.  Therefore, the defendant committed larceny. ","Other Crimes"
"A marksman bought a new rifle and wanted to try it out by doing some target shooting.  He went out into the country to an area where he had previously hunted.  Much to his surprise, he noticed that the area beyond a clearing contained several newly constructed houses that had not been there before.  Between the houses there was a small playground where several children were playing.  Nevertheless, the marksman nailed a paper target to a tree and went to a point where the tree was between himself and the playground.  He then fired several shots at the target.  One of the shots missed the target and the tree and hit and killed one of the children in the playground.<br /><br /><br />The marksman was convicted of murder.  He appealed, contending that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction of murder.<br /><br /><br /><br />The appellate court should",multiple-choice," A. affirm the conviction, because the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction of murder."," B. reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial, because the evidence is not sufficient for murder but will support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter."," C. reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial, because the evidence is not sufficient for murder but will support a conviction of involuntary manslaughter."," D. reverse the conviction and order the case dismissed, because the evidence is sufficient only for a finding of negligence and negligence alone cannot support a criminal conviction.",1,"The correct answer is A.  When determining the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a charge, the appellate court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the state.  In this case, the marksman placed his target so that, if he missed, he would be shooting in the direction of the children; he fired numerous shots from a rifle in the direction of an occupied playground and killed a child.  Even though he did not have the intent to kill, the evidence is sufficient for a jury to find that the marksman acted with extreme recklessness toward human life, which is sufficient for a finding of malice aforethought for the murder conviction.  The appellate court should affirm the conviction of murder.<br /><br /><br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the evidence was sufficient and because there was no ""heat of passion"" defense presented which might allow for a voluntary manslaughter charge.  Answer C is incorrect because the evidence was sufficient to prove malice aforethought, and because the marksman's actions were more than just negligent; they were grossly reckless.  Answer D is incorrect because the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction, and because criminal negligence can indeed support a criminal conviction.  Because the appellate court considers only whether there is sufficient evidence to support the conviction, the jury could have found that the marksman's extreme recklessness was sufficient for a finding of malice aforethought necessary for a murder conviction.  Therefore, his conviction should be affirmed.<br />",Homicide
"In a jurisdiction that has abolished the felony-murder rule, but otherwise follows the common law of murder, a man and woman, both armed with automatic weapons, went into a bank to rob it.  The man ordered all the persons in the bank to lie on the floor.  When some were slow to obey, the woman, not intending to hit anyone, fired about 15 rounds into the air.

Neither can be guilty of murder, but both can be convicted of manslaughter based upon an unintentional homicide."," C. The woman can be convicted only of manslaughter, but the man cannot be convicted of murder or manslaughter."," D. Both can be convicted of murder.",4,"The correct answer is D. Common law murder is not a specific intent crime. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied by actions that show a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. In this case, the woman's act of firing an automatic weapon in a populated bank demonstrates the reckless indifference necessary to show malice aforethought, and the woman can be convicted of murder. The woman was acting with gross recklessness toward human life and thus with malice aforethought. The man is the woman's accomplice: a person who aids or encourages another to commit the illegal conduct. He is liable for the principal crime so long as he intended that the crime be committed. Not only is he liable for the principal crime, but also all other foreseeable crimes that occur. In this case, it was foreseeable that entering into a bank to rob it with loaded guns could result in firing those guns and killing someone. Therefore the man can also be convicted of murder under accomplice liability.<br /><br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the man, as the woman's accomplice, is criminally liable for the woman's actions, and can be convicted of murder.  Answer B is incorrect because even unintentional homicides can be the basis for murder if they are done with malice aforethought.  In this case, the gross recklessness toward human life shown by the woman and the man's actions is sufficient for a finding of malice aforethought.  Answer C is incorrect because the woman can be convicted of murder, not just manslaughter.  Answer C is also incorrect because the man is criminally responsible for the woman's actions.  Although there is no felony-murder liability in this jurisdiction, both the woman and the man can be convicted of murder.",Homicide
"A jurisdiction has the following decisional law on questions of principal and accomplice liability:<br><br><br /><br />CASE A: The defendant, a hardware store owner, sold several customers an item known as ""SuperTrucker,"" which detects police radar and enables speeders to avoid detection.

Case C presents an instance where the person being charged as an accomplice is not the person the statute intended to penalize. If a statute defines a crime that necessarily involves more than one person and only provides for liability for one person, it is presumed that the legislative intent was to immunize the other person from liability as an accomplice. In case C, the statute prohibits the <i> taking </i> of bribes by a public official. Since the defendant was only a private person giving a bribe, he would not be guilty as an accomplice under the statute. In the present case, the college student is purchasing narcotics but is being charged as an accomplice to the <i> sale </i> of narcotics. Therefore, the college student is not the person that the statute intends to target, and should be acquitted of the accomplice charge based on the authority of case C. <br><br><br /><br />Case A illustrates the rule that a defendant is guilty as an accomplice if he provides an individual with the means to commit an offense and the assistance could not be for a legitimate purpose. The college student did not assist in the sale of narcotics, so case A is not the proper authority. Case B illustrates the rule that a defendant who provides substantial encouragement or assistance to an unwitting third-person in the commission of a crime will be liable as an accomplice to the crime. The student did not sell narcotics through a third-person, so case B is not the proper authority. Case D illustrates the rule that a defendant would not be guilty as an accomplice for providing a means for an offense to occur when there is a legitimate purpose for providing the good or service. The college student did not assist in the sale of narcotics and had no legitimate purpose for buying narcotics off the street, so case D is not the proper authority.","Inchoate Crimes"

The issue is whether the neighbor was privileged to use deadly force in self-defense given the situation. A person may use deadly force in self-defense when: (1) he is without fault (i.e., not the aggressor or provoker), (2) he is confronted with unlawful force, and (3) he is threatened with imminent death or great bodily harm. In this case, the husband was clearly the aggressor, and used unlawful deadly force in attacking the neighbor with the knife.

It is irrelevant to the charge of burglary whether she actually found the typewriter or not; merely having the intent is sufficient.

Although there is no mental state requirement for the offense listed in the statute, one will be presumed by the courts to avoid strict liability offenses.

Don't be lured in by the fact that the friends were members of a street gang or that the victim was a helpless elderly lady.

At common law, second degree murder an intentional killing of a human being without premeditation and deliberation.  The defendant's best defense to a charge of second degree murder is that he was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was insane at the time of the killing.  The defendant would qualify as insane under the <i> M'Naghten </i> rule, because his delusions caused him to believe that his actions were not criminal as he was acting properly in self-defense.  Likewise, under the <i> Durham</i> test, the defendant would qualify for the insanity defense because his crime was a product of his mental defect.  It is unclear if the defendant would qualify as insane under the irresistible impulse test because it is unspecified whether the defendant was unable to control his actions or to conform his conduct to the law. Nevertheless, given the ineffectiveness of all other options, an insanity defense would be the defendant's best chance of acquittal.<br><br><br /><br />Answer A is incorrect.  Voluntary intoxication is typically not a defense to second degree murder.  It may be a defense to first degree murder, which requires a specific intent, but not to second degree murder which requires at lease criminal recklessness.<br><br><br /><br />Answer B is incorrect.  Malice aforethought requires a state of mind of intent to inflict great bodily injury or a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life.

She knew where the neighbor kept the necklace because she had been in the neighbor's house on many occasions when the neighbor had taken off the necklace and put it away in a jewelry box in the bathroom. One night, the woman went to the neighbor's house. The neighbor was away, and the house was dark. The woman opened the bathroom window, saw the jewelry box on the counter, and started to climb inside. As her leg cleared the window sill, the neighbor's dog began to bark loudly. Terrified, the woman jumped back outside and fled.<br /><br />The crimes below are listed in descending order of seriousness. What is the most serious crime, if any, committed by the woman?",multiple-choice,"A. 	Burglary.","B. 	Attempted burglary.","C. 	Attempted larceny.","D. 	No crime.",1,"Answer A is correct. The woman is guilty of burglary because she unlawfully entered the neighbor's house at night with intent to commit a felony (larceny). The woman's actions constituted the requisite entry of the neighbor's house. To constitute burglary, it is sufficient if any part of the actor's person intruded, even momentarily, into the structure. Thus it has been held that the intrusion of a part of a hand in opening a window, or the momentary intrusion of part of a foot clearing the window sill, constituted the requisite entry. Answers B and D are incorrect.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. The woman may have been guilty of attempted larceny, but that crime arguably would merge into, and in any event was less serious than, the crime of burglary. As explained above, the woman is guilty of burglary because she unlawfully entered the neighbor's house at night with intent to commit a felony (larceny). The woman's actions constituted the requisite entry of the neighbor's house.","Other Crimes"
"While on their way home from a ball game, a driver and his passenger stopped at an all-night gas station. The passenger offered to pay for the gas. While the passenger pumped gas, he was surprised to see the driver enter the station, take money from the unattended cash drawer, and get back in the car. The passenger paid the attendant for the gas, and the driver drove off. The driver offered to reimburse the passenger for the gas, but the passenger declined. After discovering the missing cash, the gas station attendant called the police, and the driver was later stopped. The driver escaped with the stolen money, however, and was never prosecuted. <br /><br />If the passenger is prosecuted for theft as an accomplice, should he be convicted?",multiple-choice,"A. 	No, because he had no intent to promote the commission of the offense.","B. 	No, because the driver, the principal, was never prosecuted.","C.

"A state statute requires any person licensed to sell prescription drugs to file with the State Board of Health a report listing the types and amounts of such drugs sold if his sales of such drugs exceed $50,000 during a calendar year. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to ""knowingly fail to file"" such a report.<br /><br />The defendant, who is licensed to sell prescription drugs, sold $63,000 worth of prescription drugs during 2006 but did not file the report. Charged with the misdemeanor, the defendant testifies that he did a very poor job of keeping records and did not realize that his sales of prescription drugs had exceeded $50,000. If the jury believes the defendant, he should be found",multiple-choice,"A. 	guilty, because this is a public welfare offense.","B. 	guilty, because he cannot be excused on the basis of his own failure to keep proper records.","C. 	not guilty, because the statute punishes omissions and he was not given fair warning of his duty to act.","D. 	not guilty, because he was not aware of the value of the drugs he had sold.",4,"D is correct. The statute itself defines the required mental state by stating that the defendant must ""knowingly"" fail to file the required report. Here, if the jury believes the defendant did not know that he had sold over $50,000 worth of prescription drugs, and thus he did not know that he had to file the report, they should find him not guilty. The mens rea requirement was not met in this case.<br /><br />A is incorrect. Since the statute specifically states the mens rea requirement, it takes precedence over common law requirements of a public welfare offense, which generally are strict liability offenses.<br /><br />B is incorrect. While the defendant's poor record keeping may violate a different offense, it did negate the mens rea requirement of ""knowingly"" failing to file, and thus, is a valid defense to the criminal charge.<br /><br />C is incorrect. There is no general requirement that a criminal statute give fair warning before guilt can be established, and there is no evidence that the defendant, in fact, did not know of his duty to report.","General Principles"
"A homeowner met a man, who was known to him to be a burglar, in a bar. The homeowner told the man that he needed money. He promised to pay the man $500 if the man would go to the homeowner's house the following night and take some silverware. The homeowner explained to the man that, although the silverware was legally his, his wife would object to his selling it.<br /><br />The homeowner pointed out his home, one of a group of similar tract houses. He drew a floor plan of the house that showed the location of the silverware. The homeowner said that his wife usually took several sleeping pills before retiring, and that he would make sure that she took them the next night. He promised to leave a window unlocked.<br /><br />Everything went according to the plan except that the man, deceived by the similarity of the tract houses, went to the wrong house. He found a window unlocked, climbed in and found silver where the homeowner had indicated. He took the silver to the cocktail lounge where the payoff was to take place. At that point police arrested the two men.<br /><br />If the homeowner and the man are charged with a conspiracy to commit burglary, their best argument for acquittal is that",multiple-choice,"A. 	the man was the alter ego of the homeowner.","B. 	they did not intend to commit burglary.","C. 	there was no overt act.","D. 	there was no agreement.",2,"The correct answer is B. A charge of conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a crime. Specifically, at least two of the co-conspirators must intend that the crime be committed. Although the man and the homeowner did agree to carry out certain actions, they did not have intent to commit a crime. This lack of intent is their best defense to a conspiracy charge.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. Even if the man were considered an alter ego of the homeowner, that would not be a defense to a charge of conspiracy. Conspiracy punishes the agreement, regardless of who has proposed it. Answer C is incorrect. In some states, conspiracy requires the commission of an overt act, and the actions taken here by the man and homeowner were sufficient. The planning, the homeowner's encouragement and providing of the plans, and the man's breaking into the house, were all overt actions done in the commission of the conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect; although lack of an agreement is a defense to conspiracy, the facts here clearly indicate that there was an agreement.","Other Crimes"
"The owner of a house told his neighbor that he was going away for two weeks and asked the neighbor to keep an eye on his house. The neighbor agreed. The owner gave the neighbor a key to use to check on the house.<br /><br />The neighbor decided to have a party in the owner's house. He invited a number of friends. One friend, a pickpocket, went into the owner's bedroom, took some of the owner's rings, and put them in his pocket.<br /><br />Which of the following is true?<br />",multiple-choice,"A. 	The neighbor and the pickpocket are guilty of burglary.","B. 	The neighbor is guilty of burglary and the pickpocket is guilty of larceny.","C. 	The neighbor is guilty of trespass and the pickpocket is guilty of larceny.","D. 	The pickpocket is guilty of larceny and the neighbor is not guilty of any crime.",4,"Answer A is incorrect because neither the neighbor, nor the pickpocket, committed a burglary. At common law, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony therein. The neighbor had the owner's permission to be in the residence, and there is no evidence that the neighbor had the intent to commit a felony or theft in the residence. The neighbor is not guilty of burglary. Likewise, the pickpocket had permission to be in the residence and, since he was invited into the dwelling, there is no evidence that the pickpocket broke into the house. There is also no evidence that the pickpocket entered the party with the intent to commit a felony or a theft.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the neighbor did not commit a burglary and is not criminally responsible for the pickpocket's actions, because he did not have the intent that the larceny occur, and he did not knowingly aid and abet the pickpocket in the commission of the crime. However, the pickpocket did take, and carry away, the owner's rings, with the intent to deprive the owner of them, and is thus guilty of larceny.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because the neighbor did not commit a trespass. The neighbor had permission to be in the residence by the owner. The pickpocket is guilty of larceny, but the neighbor committed no crime.<br /><br />The correct answer is D. The neighbor is not criminally responsible for the pickpocket's theft, and the neighbor had permission to be in the residence. The neighbor is not guilty of any crime. The pickpocket, however, took the owner's property, without the owner's consent, put it in his pocket, and is thus guilty of larceny.","Other Crimes"
"A husband decided to kill his wife by poisoning her. He asked his friend, a pharmacist, to obtain some Curare, a deadly poison, and to give it to him without recording the transaction. Because the pharmacist suspected the husband's motive, she supplied the husband with a small quantity of Marvane, an antibiotic, instead of Curare. Marvane is harmless if administered in small quantities, except for the less than 1 percent of the population who are allergic to the drug. The husband injected his wife with Marvane while she slept. She was allergic to the drug and died from the injection. The pharmacist was distraught and confessed the entire affair to the police, explaining that she had failed to report the husband's conduct to the authorities because she feared that it would end their friendship if she did.<br /><br />The pharmacist is an accomplice to",multiple-choice,"A. 	murder.","B. 	manslaughter.","C. 	criminally negligent homicide.","D. 	no degree of criminal homicide.",4,"The correct answer is D. The pharmacist, because she lacked any intent that the crime be committed, cannot be an accomplice to any charge of criminal homicide. To be an accessory to a crime, the defendant must intend that the crime be committed, and aid and abet in the commission of the offense. Although the pharmacist may have aided in the commission of the offense, she did not have the requisite intent that would make her an accomplice and she is not criminally liable for the husband's actions. Answers A, B, and C are all incorrect because they ignore the mens rea requirement for accomplice liability.","General Principles"

Attempted kidnapping requires that the defendant have the intent to commit a kidnapping and take a substantial step toward the commission of kidnapping. In this fact situation, the girlfriend's actions, although done under a fraudulent belief that the defendant wanted to marry her, were never against her will.

"A woman went to an art gallery and falsely represented that she was an agent for a museum and wanted to purchase a painting that was hanging in the gallery. The woman and the gallery owner then agreed on a price for the painting to be paid 10 days later, and the woman took the painting. When the gallery failed to receive the payment when due, the owner called the museum and discovered that the woman did not work there. The owner then notified the police. <br /><br />When interviewed by the police, the woman admitted making the false representation and acquiring the painting, but she said she believed that the painting had been stolen from her by someone who worked in the gallery. <br /><br />Is the woman guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses?<br />",multiple-choice,"A.	No, because she believed that the painting belonged to her.","B.	No, because the gallery owner would have sold the painting to anyone who agreed to pay the price.","C.	Yes, because even if her representation was not material, she never intended to pay for the painting.","D.	Yes, because she knowingly made a false representation on which the gallery owner relied.",1,"A is correct. The crime of false pretenses, like other theft crimes, requires the intent to steal. The woman cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses, because she made the false statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her. <br /><br />B is incorrect. This fact does not excuse the woman for knowingly making false statements to obtain property that she would not otherwise have been able to obtain. The reason the woman cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses is that she lacked the requisite intent to steal; she made the false statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her. <br /><br />C is incorrect. In some jurisdictions, a false pretenses conviction can be based on a promise to make payment in the future if the promisor had no present intent to make the future payment. But the promisor must have the intent to steal the property. The woman cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses, because she lacked the requisite intent to steal; she made the false statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her. <br /><br />D is incorrect. Even assuming that the woman otherwise could be convicted of false pretenses, false pretenses requires the intent to steal required for other theft crimes. Accordingly, the woman cannot properly be found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses, because she made the false statements to obtain property that she subjectively believed belonged to her.","Other Crimes"
"A man had a heart ailment so serious that his doctors had concluded that only a heart transplant could save his life. They therefore arranged to have him flown to a city to have the operation performed.<br /><br />The man's nephew, who stood to inherit from him, poisoned him. The poison produced a reaction which required postponing the journey. The plane on which the man was to have flown crashed, and all aboard were killed. By the following day, the man's heart was so weakened by the effects of the poison that he suffered a heart attack and died. If charged with criminal homicide, the nephew should be found",multiple-choice,"A.	guilty.","B.	not guilty, because his act did not hasten the deceased's death, but instead prolonged it by one day.","C.	not guilty, because the deceased was already suffering from a fatal illness.","D.	not guilty, because the poison was not the sole cause of death.",1,"The correct answer is A. The nephew, hoping to collect his inheritance, intentionally caused the death of the man, and should be found guilty of criminal homicide. The issue in this question is what actions are sufficient to be considered as ""causing"" the death of another. The actions must be an actual and proximate cause of the victim's death, but they need not be the sole cause of death. In this case, the man was poisoned by his nephew, which weakened the man's heart, and eventually lead to his death, and is thus sufficient causation to sustain a homicide charge.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. The fact that a victim may have died in another manner if the defendant's actions were not taken is not a defense to a homicide charge. The nephew's poisoning did shorten the man's life, and the fact that it was possible that the man could have died in another manner does not serve as a defense to the charge. Answer C is incorrect. The nephew's poisoning shortened the man's life, and the fact that the man may have died from a fatal illness, while it shows the nephew isn't so smart, does not serve as a defense to the charge of murder. The facts given show that the poison did weaken the man's heart, leading to the heart attack. Answer D is incorrect. The action need not be the only cause for a homicide conviction; it merely must be a cause. The nephew will be held criminally liable for the foreseeable consequences of his acts. The man's death was clearly foreseeable, and was in fact intended. The nephew's actions are both an actual cause and a proximate cause of the man's death.",Homicide

The man later moved to State B where he brought an action to obtain custody of the daughter. A local judge awarded him custody.

The man drove to State A, picked the daughter up at her preschool, and took her back to State B with him.<br /><br />He was indicted for kidnapping in State A, extradited from State B, and tried. At trial, he testified that he had relied on his attorney's advice in taking the daughter, and that at the time he believed his conduct was not illegal.<br /><br />If the jury believes his testimony, the man should be",multiple-choice,"A.	acquitted, because he acted on the advice of an attorney.","B.	acquitted, because he lacked a necessary mental element of the crime.","C.	convicted, because reliance on an attorney's advice is not a defense.","D.	convicted, provided a reasonable person would have known that the attorney's advice was erroneous.",2,"The correct answer is B. The kidnapping statute requires that the man have taken the daughter from the custody of the woman, knowing he has no privilege to do so. The man, because he obtained the judicial order in State B, thought he had the privilege to take the daughter, and thus the man did not know he had no privilege to take the daughter. Therefore, the man did not have the requisite mens rea to sustain a charge of kidnapping.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because attorney's advice is not considered an ""official interpretation of the law,"" which is required for the proper application of a mistake of law defense. However, his reliance on the attorney's advice did, in this case, negate the requisite mental state for kidnapping. Answer C, while it may be a valid statement of the law, is an incorrect answer because it ignores the fact that the man did not know he had no privilege to take the daughter, and thus could not be convicted of kidnapping. Answer D is incorrect because it applies a reasonable person standard; the appropriate standard is a subjective one. The statute requires that the man take the child knowing he did not have the privilege to do so. If the jury believes him, the man did not take a child from the custody of his custodial parent, knowing he had no privilege to do so, and cannot be properly convicted of kidnapping.","General Principles"

The woman, fearful of being struck by the man, pushed the man away.<br /><br />If charged with criminal battery, the woman should be found",multiple-choice,"A.	guilty, because she intentionally pushed the man.","B.	guilty, because she caused the touching of the man whether she meant to do so or not.","C.	not guilty, because a push is not an offensive touching.","D.	not guilty, because she was justified in pushing the man.",4,"The correct answer is D. The woman only pushed the man because she reasonably believed that the man was going to strike her. Thus, she should be found not guilty of criminal battery because she was acting in self-defense. The woman believed that the push was necessary to defend herself against the imminent use of unlawful force and, given the fact situation, that belief was reasonable. Answer A ignores the woman's obvious self-defense claim and is thus incorrect. Likewise with Answer B. A push is generally considered offensive, so Answer C is incorrect. The woman's actions in pushing the man were not done with any criminal intent but rather to protect herself from what she reasonably believed to be the man's attempt to strike her.","General Principles"

The woman cannot be found guilty of murder, because the hit man did not cause the neighbor's death, but she can be convicted of attempted murder. An attempt is an act done with the intent to commit a crime where the act falls short of the full commission of the crime. Here, the woman hired a hit man to murder the neighbor, and all of the requisite acts for the commission of a murder occurred except that the hit man did not cause the neighbor's death.

Because the jury found that the defendant intended to either kill or to inflict serious bodily harm, this means that the defendant killed the victim with malice aforethought, and he should be found guilty of murder. <br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because it misstates the requirements of malice aforethought. Malice aforethought can be found not only by the intent to kill, but also by the intent to inflict serious bodily harm. Answer B is incorrect because a significant amount of time had passed between the provoking event and the defendant's actions, so there is no ""heat of passion"" defense in this situation. In addition, it is possible for the jury to find that the defendant acted in a rage provoked by the victim but still find him guilty of murder if the rage or the provocation was unreasonable or insufficient.

Embezzlement.","B.	Obtaining property by false pretenses.","C.	Robbery and larceny.","D.	Robbery or larceny.",4,"Answer D is correct. All the elements of larceny and robbery were present. Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of his interest in the property. Robbery is the taking of personal property of another from the other's person by force or intimidation with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. The woman's threat of immediate harm to the clerk was sufficient to constitute the intimidation required for robbery. However, because larceny is a lesser included offense of robbery, she cannot be convicted of both offenses for a single incident.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of property of another by a person in lawful possession of that property. The woman never had lawful possession of the money and so cannot be convicted of embezzlement.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. Theft by false pretenses occurs when a person obtains title to the property of another by an intentional or knowing false statement of past or existing fact with the intent to defraud the other. This is larceny because the money was taken by trespass, i.e., without consent and by force or threat of force. Because they money was taken by a trespass, and not with the consent of the victim, the woman cannot have valid title, she only has possession. The crime was not false pretenses because, among other things, the woman never obtained title to the cash.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. It is true that all the elements of larceny and robbery (which may be thought of as aggravated larceny) were present, as explained above. However, because robbery and larceny are greater and lesser included offenses, a defendant cannot be convicted of both for a single offense.","General Principles"

Since the young woman had known she was to commit this murder the day before and, having armed herself with a gun, had gone to the restaurant with the intent to kill the rival gang member, and did, in fact, kill the rival gang member, the young woman is guilty of intentional and premeditated murder in the first degree.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because duress does not provide a defense to a murder charge; the law recognizes no duress so severe that it will mitigate the intentional killing of another human being. Answer B is incorrect because necessity is not available as a defense when the charge is murder; there is no necessity great enough to mitigate the intentional killing of another human being. Answer D is incorrect because the young woman intentionally, and with premeditation, killed the rival gang member, and is thus guilty of first degree murder and not second degree murder. Since the young woman killed the rival gang member intentionally and with premeditation, and the defenses of duress and necessity cannot be raised to a charge of murder, the young woman is guilty of first degree murder.

"While walking home one evening, an off-duty police officer was accosted by a stranger. The stranger had been drinking and mistakenly thought the police officer was a man who was having an affair with his wife. Intending to frighten the police officer but not to harm him, the stranger pulled out a knife, screamed obscenities, and told the police officer he was going to kill him. Frightened and reasonably believing the stranger was going to kill him and that using deadly force was his only salvation, the police officer took out his service revolver and shot and killed the stranger. The police officer is charged with murder.<br /><br />The police officer's claim of self-defense should be",multiple-choice,"A.	sustained, because the police officer reasonably believed the stranger was planning to kill him and that deadly force was required.","B.	sustained, because the killing was in hot blood upon sufficient provocation.","C.	denied, because the stranger did not in fact intend to harm the police officer and the police officer was incorrect in believing that he did.","D.	denied, because the police officer was not defending his home and had an obligation to retreat or to repel with less than deadly force.",1,"The correct answer is A. In order to succeed in a claim of self-defense to a murder charge, the defendant must show that the defendant believed that the action taken was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself from unlawful force, and that the belief was reasonable. The question itself indicated that, not only did the police officer believe that the stranger was going to kill him, but also that that belief was reasonable. Therefore, the police officer's self-defense claim should be sustained.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because it deals with the difference at common law between murder and manslaughter and does not involve the police officer's self-defense claim at all.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because it is contradicted by the wording in the question. The question states that the police officer's belief that the stranger was going to kill him was reasonable. In addition, the actual intent of the stranger, as well as the question of whether the police officer's reasonable belief was, in reality, correct, would not enter into the deliberation regarding the propriety of the police officer's self-defense claim.<br /><br />Answer D is also contradicted by the wording of the question, which clearly indicates that the police officer's belief that using deadly force was ""his only salvation"" was also reasonable. The threat to the police officer was immediate and deadly, thereby allowing his self-defense claim to succeed. The police officer was not required to retreat or repel with less than deadly force. He only shot the stranger because he reasonably believed that it was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm from the stranger's unlawful use of force, so his claim of self-defense should be sustained.","General Principles"

The bullet ricochets off the street and strikes and kills the victim.",2,"The correct answer is B. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Murder can also be committed under the felony murder rule if the killing occurs in the commission of a violent felony. The defendant in answer B was committing the violent felony of armed robbery, which resulted in the death of the victim. Therefore, the defendant in answer B is the most likely to be found guilty of common-law murder. <br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the defendant can claim self-defense because he reasonably believed he was facing great bodily harm. Answer C is incorrect because the defendant also did not act with malice aforethought. His actions, while possibly negligent, are not a sufficient showing of the reckless indifference necessary to sustain a murder charge. Answer D is incorrect because while shooting a gun within city limits is likely negligent, it does not rise to the level of recklessness indifference necessary for murder. Thus, the most likely defendant to be found guilty of common-law murder is the defendant in answer B.",Homicide

After they entered the apartment, the defendant forced the woman to bind and gag her husband and then to open a safe which contained a diamond necklace. The defendant then tied her up and fled with the necklace. He was apprehended by apartment building security guards.

Robbery is defined at common law as the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Burglary is the breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein. Felony murder is the killing of a human being in the course of a violent felony. In this case, the defendant is guilty of burglary, robbery, and murder. The defendant forced, at weapon point, the couple to allow him to enter their dwelling, which is sufficient for breaking and entering. When this breaking and entering occurred, the defendant had the intent to commit a theft of their property, and he is guilty of burglary. In addition, the defendant used force by tying and binding the couple, and the threat of force by threatening them, to take the necklace from the couple, and he had the intent to permanently deprive them of the necklace. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of robbery. Finally, the husband died as a result of the commission of those two violent felonies, so the defendant is guilty of felony murder. During the commission of the robbery and burglary, the defendant had the husband bound and gagged. That the husband would die from these actions, and the stress of attempting to escape, is foreseeable from the commission of the crime, and the defendant is guilty of murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because it ignores the forced entry with the intent to commit felony theft into the apartment.

"A bank teller was fired by the president of a bank. The teller wanted to take revenge against the president, but decided against attempting it personally, because he knew the president was protected around the clock by bank security guards. The teller knew that a man had a violent temper and was very jealous. The teller falsely told the man that the man's wife was having an affair with the bank president. Enraged, the man said, ""What am I going to do?"" The teller said, ""If it were my wife, I'd just march into his office and blow his brains out."" The man grabbed a revolver and rushed to the bank.

Attempted murder requires that a defendant have the specific intent that a murder occur and that the defendant take a substantial step toward the commission of the murder. The teller intended that the president be murdered by the man, and by lying to the man, whom he knew to be violent and jealous, and encouraging him to kill the president, the teller took substantial steps toward the commission of murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because a charge of attempt requires that the defendant have the intent that the crime be committed; extreme recklessness is insufficient. Answer C is incorrect because it misstates the requirements for ""substantial step"" and although the man failed to murder the president, the steps the teller took in his attempt to murder the president were ""substantial"" and could have resulted in the murder of the president. Even if it were factually impossible for the man to murder the president, factual impossibility is not a defense to a charge of attempt, and the teller would still be convicted of attempted murder.

"The defendant and her friend went into a drugstore, where the defendant reached into the cash register and took out $200. The store owner came out of a back room, saw what had happened, and told the defendant to put the money back. The friend then took a revolver from under his coat and shot and killed the store owner.<br /><br />The defendant claims that the store owner owed her $200 and that she went to the drugstore to try to collect the debt. She said that she asked her friend to come along just in case the store owner made trouble but that she did not plan on using any force and did not know that her friend was armed.<br /><br />If the defendant is prosecuted for murder on the basis of being an accessory to her friend in committing a murder and the jury believes her claim, she should be found<br /><br /><br /><br />",multiple-choice,"A.	guilty, because in firing the shot her friend was trying to help her.","B.	guilty, because she and her friend were acting in concert in a dangerous undertaking.","C.	not guilty, because she had no idea that her friend was armed and she did not plan to use force.","D.	not guilty, because she was exercising self-help and did not intend to steal.",3,"The correct answer is C. The defendant was not an accessory to her friend and does not bear criminal responsibility for her actions. To be an accessory to a criminal charge, the defendant must have the intent that the crime be committed and aid and abet in the commission of the offense. If the jury believes the defendant, then the defendant did not have the intent to commit murder and did not aid, abet, or encourage her friend in the murder. The defendant did not know her friend was armed, did not plan to use force, and did not have the intent that a murder occur.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the friend's motive for the murder is immaterial in determining the defendant's accountability as an accessory. Unless the defendant had the requisite intent and aided and abetted in the offense, she does not bear criminal responsibility for her friend's actions, regardless of his reason for pulling the trigger. Answer B is incorrect because it misstates the requirements for criminal responsibility as an accessory; the defendant did not aid and abet her friend in the murder, and, if the jury believes the defendant's claim, the undertaking was not necessarily dangerous. Answer D is incorrect because the defendant's intent to steal would only be relevant under the felony-murder application and not when the defendant is charged as an accessory.

The most serious crime the defendant committed is larceny. The customer committed a trespassory taking and carrying away of another's property with the intent to steal it. He obtained possession of, but not title to, the watch by lying about a present fact.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. There was no robbery because the customer did not take the watch by force or threat of force. Instead, he committed larceny—-a trespassory taking and carrying away of another's property with the intent to steal it. He obtained possession of, but not title to, the watch by lying about a present fact.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. Theft by false pretenses occurs when the defendant obtains title to the property of another by an intentional (or knowing) false statement of past or existing fact with the intent to defraud the other. The crime was larceny, not false pretenses, because the customer obtained possession of, but not title to, the watch.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. Embezzlement occurs when the defendant fraudulently converts the property of another, and where the defendant is in lawful possession of that property.

"A bartender is charged with the statutory offense of ""knowingly violating a regulation of the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board"" and that he knowingly violated regulation number 345-90 issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. That regulation prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of 18 and also prohibits the sale of any alcoholic beverage to a person over the age of 17 and under the age of 22 without the presentation of such person's driver's license or other identification showing the age of the purchaser to be 18 or older.<br /><br />The evidence showed that the bartender worked in a tavern and sold a bottle of beer to a person who was 17 years old and that the bartender did not ask for or see the purchaser's driver's license or any other identification.<br /><br />Which of the following, if found by the jury, would be of the most help to the bartender?",multiple-choice,"The purchaser had a driver's license that falsely showed his age to be 21.","The bartender had never been told he was supposed to check identification of persons over 17 and under 22 before selling them alcohol.","The bartender did not know that the regulations classified beer as an alcoholic beverage.","The bartender mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old.",4,"The correct answer is D. The regulation stating that bartenders must require people between the ages of 18 and 21 to show identification of their age carries with it the implication that people above the age of 21 are not required to show identification. The bartender's best argument is that, since he mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24 years old, he was allowed to sell them beer and was not required to obtain identification; in relying on that statute, he did not ascertain the minor's age. This may allow him to argue that the regulation contains a mens rea element requiring that he knowingly violate the law. Because the bartender did not knowingly sell alcohol to the minor, he should be acquitted.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the fact that the purchaser could have presented a fake identification does not excuse the bartender's not asking to see it; his only legitimate excuse would be that he believed the person to be over 21 and that the statute includes a mens rea requirement. Answer B is incorrect because ignorance of the law is generally not an excuse, and the bartender's not being told that he has to check identification does not affect the offense's mens rea requirement. When a crime requires that the defendant act knowingly, he must have been aware that his conduct was of a particular nature, or at least know that his conduct will necessarily or very likely cause a particular result. Here, he must have been aware of the fact that he was selling to a minor, or to someone between the ages of 18 and 21, not the fact that his conduct was violating that regulation.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because, again, ignorance of the law is no excuse, and not knowing that beer is an alcoholic beverage does not excuse the bartender's actions. If the jury found that the bartender mistakenly believed the purchaser to be 24-years-old, the bartender could argue that he relied on the statute's requiring identification from 18 to 21 year olds, and thus did not meet the mens rea requirement of the regulation.","General Principles"
"A father was fired from his job. Too proud to apply for unemployment benefits, he used his savings to feed his family.

Eventually, weakened by malnutrition, the child died as a result of the illness.<br /><br />What crime has the father committed?",multiple-choice,Murder.,"Involuntary manslaughter.","Voluntary manslaughter.","No form of criminal homicide.",2,"The correct answer is B. The child's death was the result, not of malice aforethought, but of criminal negligence on the part of the father. Failure to seek medical attention for an illness is generally insufficient for the finding of malice aforethought, so the father, in his criminal negligence, has committed involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because murder, at common law, requires that the killing be done with malice aforethought. Because the death resulted from an untreated illness, and there was no evidence that the father acted with either actual or implied malice toward his child, he is not guilty of murder. Answer C is incorrect because a person is only guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he successfully raises a heat of passion defense to a murder charge. There was no heat of passion defense raised, and, combined with a lack of evidence that the father intended his child to die, he cannot properly be convicted of voluntary manslaughter. Answer D is incorrect; although there is no evidence of malice, the father's refusal to seek treatment for his child, to whom he owed a duty of care, was a proximate cause of his child's death.

The defendant's best argument for being found not guilty of felony murder is that he is not responsible for the customer's actions in shooting the clerk. The courts are split regarding whether a defendant is liable for felony murder when the death is caused by a third party. Under the proximate cause theory, a defendant can be liable where the innocent party is killed as the result of resistance from the victim or police. However, under the agency theory, the defendant will only be found liable for felony murder when someone is killed by a person acting as an accomplice of the defendant. Given that the customer is neither a victim nor the police, and that the customer is not an agent or an accomplice of the defendant, the defendant's best argument is that he is not responsible for the customer's actions. Therefore, answer D provides the best possible defense.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because felony murder does not require that the defendant have the specific intent to kill the clerk. It is sufficient that the underlying felony was dangerous and that the killing was foreseeable.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because attempted robbery, even with a toy gun, is still dangerous enough to be considered a proper underlying felony for felony murder. Arguing that he did not actually complete the robbery is not the defendant's best argument for acquittal.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because, once again, the defendant's intent to create a risk of harm is irrelevant under felony murder. Regardless of his intent that nobody get hurt, he did create a situation by committing a dangerous felony, and, if he bore criminal responsibility for the actor who did the killing, he would be found guilty.

An accomplice is a person who aids or encourages another in the commission of a crime with the intent that the crime be committed. Here, the man's words of ""Kill him"" were words of encouragement, and when spoken with the intent that the crime be committed, make the man liable as an accomplice. Answer A is incorrect because there is no requirement that the encouragement create a clear and present danger. Answer B is incorrect because oral encouragement to commit murder, if accompanied by the requisite intent, is sufficient for a conviction.

When one of the devices broke down and the speeder was arrested, he confessed that he often sped, secure in the knowledge that his ""SuperTrucker"" would warn him of police radar in the vicinity. Held: The defendant guilty as an accomplice to speeding.<br /><br />CASE B: The defendant told a man that the defendant had stored some stereo equipment in a self-storage locker. He gave the man a key and asked the man to pick up the equipment and deliver it to the defendant's house. The man complied, and removed the equipment from the locker, using the key. In fact, the equipment belonged to the defendant's neighbor, whose locker key the defendant had found in the driveway.

Case B illustrates the rule that a defendant who provides substantial encouragement or assistance to an unwitting third-person in the commission of a crime can be liable as an accomplice to the crime. However, the defendant must intend that the aid or encouragement will assist in the commission of a crime. In the present case the defendant encouraged the friend to have sex with an underage girl. The defendant intended that his words would encourage the friend to commit statutory rape. Therefore, case B is the proper authority, and the defendant should be convicted as an accomplice. <br /><br />Case A illustrates the rule that a defendant is guilty as an accomplice if he provides an individual with the means to commit an offense and the assistance could not be for a legitimate purpose. The defendant did not provide the means to commit statutory rape, he only encouraged the man, so case A is not the proper authority. Case C presents an instance where the person being charged as an accomplice is not the person the statute intended to penalize. The defendant in the present case facilitated statutory rape, and is the type of person the statute was meant to cover. Thus, case C is not a proper source of authority. Case D illustrates the rule that a defendant would not be guilty as an accomplice for providing a means for an offense to occur when there is a legitimate purpose for providing the good or service.

At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought or reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. The defendant in answer A fired a rifle into an occupied house, which is clearly reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Further, the intentional use of a deadly weapon (such as a rifle) in a manner likely to produce death or serious bodily injury permits the court to infer the intent to kill. Thus, the defendant in answer A acted with the malice aforethought necessary to support a conviction for common-law-murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the shooting occurred during an argument and immediately after a physical assault. Therefore, the defendant may have the adequate provocation to mitigate his crime to voluntary manslaughter. Answer C is incorrect because the accidental killing of a pedestrian will not be sufficient proof of ""malice aforethought"" for a conviction of murder. There is no indication that the defendant acted with a reckless indifference to a high risk to human life. Answer D is incorrect because it is possible the defendant in answer D did not intend to inflict great bodily injury to the man, and the man's injuries were an unintended consequence of the fall.

The supervisor took his watch off and left it on a blanket when he went off to join in a touch football game. The employee strolled by, saw the watch on the blanket, and decided to steal it. He bent over and picked up the watch. Before he could pocket it, however, his supervisor returned. When he saw the employee holding the watch, he said, ""I know how much you like that watch.

The employee took possession of the watch without the owner's consent and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, and is thus guilty of larceny. The fact that the supervisor later gave the employee permission to take the watch does not change the fact that the employee, when he took the watch, did not have the supervisor's permission to take it and had the intent to steal it. Although he only picked the watch up, that was enough asportation because it was part of the carrying away process.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the employee did not merely attempt to take the watch; he did take it with the intent to steal it. The attempted larceny charge merged into the larceny charge when the employee committed the larceny. Answer C is incorrect because the employee, when he took the watch, did not have the supervisor's permission to take it. Answer D is incorrect because the employee committed the crime of larceny. Although he later had the owner's permission to take the property, when the employee took the watch, he did not have the owner's consent and he intended to deprive the owner of the watch.

A six-year-old child was hiding in the bushes and was struck in the eye by some of the pellets, causing loss of sight.<br /><br />If the homeowner is charged with second-degree assault, which is defined in the jurisdiction as ""maliciously causing serious physical injury to another,"" he is",multiple-choice,"not guilty, because the child was trespassing and he was using what he believed was nondeadly force.","not guilty, because he did not intend to kill or to cause serious physical injury.","guilty, because he recklessly caused serious physical injury.","guilty, because there is no privilege to use force against a person who is too young to be criminally responsible.",3,"The correct answer is C. Proof of malice does not need to be proof of an actual specific intent to kill or harm another; it can be implied from a defendant's gross recklessness with regard to human life shown. In this case, the homeowner fired a shotgun into bushes where he believed people were hiding. This action would support a finding of malice. The shooting caused the child to lose his sight, which is a serious injury. Therefore, the homeowner is guilty of second-degree assault.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the child's status as a trespasser does not automatically allow the homeowner to inflict serious bodily harm. In addition, the homeowner's belief that the force would be non-deadly would not negate the finding that he acted maliciously. Answer B is incorrect because a finding of malice does not require the intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury. Malice can also be shown by the homeowner acting extremely recklessly with regard to human life. Answer D is incorrect because it is a misstatement of the law regarding the use of force. The homeowner, when he fired a shotgun into bushes by his back fence, acted maliciously and caused a serious injury to another.

To be guilty as an accomplice, the alleged accomplice must give aid, counsel, or encouragement to the principal with the intent to encourage the crime. Here, the girlfriend is guilty as an accomplice to both burglary and larceny because she provided aid to the man with the intent of helping him not only to break into the shed but also to steal the mower (the object of the breaking); the fact that the man ultimately used an alternative means to accomplish his crimes does not eliminate the girlfriend's accomplice liability.

"The defendant, a worker in a metal working shop, had long been teasing a young colleague by calling him insulting names and ridiculing him. One day the colleague responded to the teasing by picking up a metal bar and attacking the defendant. The defendant could have escaped from the shop. Instead, he parried the blow with his left arm, and with his right hand struck the colleague on his jaw. The colleague died as a result of his injuries.<br /><br />Can the defendant be properly convicted of an offense?",multiple-choice,"Yes, the defendant can be properly convicted of involuntary manslaughter because the colleague died.","Yes, the defendant can be properly convicted of murder because he had a chance to escape the shop.","No, the defendant cannot be properly convicted of involuntary manslaughter or murder because he did not have the requisite intent.","No, the defendant cannot be properly convicted of voluntary manslaughter or murder because the defendant was acting in self-defense.",4,"The correct answer is D. When the defendant parried the colleague's blow and struck the colleague on the jaw, he was acting in self-defense and should not be convicted of any offense. A person can properly claim self-defense if the action taken is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent harm to himself from the use of unlawful force. In this case, the force the defendant used, a blow to the head, was reasonable in light of the attack on him by the colleague with a metal bar. Although he likely could have escaped the situation, the defendant was not required to retreat before using reasonable force for the situation. Finally, although generally the initial aggressor is not allowed to claim self-defense, in this question the defendant started by using words and not a physical attack. The colleague then responded unreasonably with deadly force. The defendant, then, although the initial aggressor, was able to respond in turn with deadly force. The defendant therefore has a proper claim to self-defense and should not be convicted of any crime. Thus, A and B are incorrect.<br /><br />C is incorrect. Here, the defendant intended to harm the colleague when he struck him in the jaw. He did intend to inflict great bodily injury when he responded to the colleague's attack on him. Therefore, the reason he would not be convicted of an offense is because he was acting in self-defense, not because he did not have the requisite intent.","General Principles"
"An undercover police detective told a local drug dealer that she wanted to buy cocaine but that she needed time to raise the necessary funds. The drug dealer said that he needed time to get the cocaine. They agreed to meet again in 10 days. An hour later, without a warrant, other officers forcibly entered the drug dealer's apartment and arrested him for attempted possession of a controlled substance. <br /><br />If the drug dealer is prosecuted in a common law jurisdiction for attempted possession of cocaine, should he be convicted?",multiple-choice,"No, because he had not taken sufficient acts toward commission of the crime.","No, because he was illegally arrested.","Yes, because by objective standards the undercover detective and the drug dealer had made an agreement that the dealer would obtain cocaine.","Yes, because he unequivocally expressed his intent to obtain the cocaine.",1,"Answer A is correct. The common law of attempt required that the defendant commit some act (beyond mere ""preparation"") toward bringing about the intended crime. Here, the drug dealer took no act, much less any act that would qualify at common law, toward obtaining the cocaine. Indeed, the drug dealer likely would not be guilty of attempt even under the Model Penal Code's broadened standards because there was no substantial step toward commission of the crime.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the drug dealer should not be convicted of attempted possession of the cocaine, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The legality of a defendant's arrest has nothing to do with whether the defendant was guilty of an attempt. The common law of attempt requires that the defendant commit some act (beyond mere preparation) toward bringing about the intended crime. Here, the drug dealer took no steps toward obtaining the cocaine. Indeed, the drug dealer likely would not be guilty of attempt even under the Model Penal Code's broadened standards because there was no substantial step toward commission of the crime.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. An agreement to commit a crime is neither necessary nor sufficient to constitute attempt. The common law of attempt requires that the defendant commit some act (beyond mere preparation) toward bringing about the intended crime. Here, the drug dealer took no steps toward obtaining the cocaine. Indeed, the drug dealer likely would not be guilty of attempt even under the Model Penal Code's broadened standards because there was no substantial step toward commission of the crime.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. Attempt under common law requires more than an unequivocal expression of criminal intent; the defendant must also commit some act toward bringing about the intended crime.

At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought exists if the defendant's actions show a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Despite not having the intent to kill, driving a car into a crowd of children demonstrated a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Therefore, the driver can be convicted of murder.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the driver did not have the intent to kill anyone, therefore, the intent to kill cannot be transferred to the harm caused to the child. Answer B is incorrect because the underlying felony for a proper felony-murder charge must be separate and apart from the actions resulting in the death. Therefore, assault with a deadly weapon will not qualify as an underlying felony for purposes of felony murder liability. Answer C is incorrect because the driver's stated intent in the question was not to kill but to watch the children flee. He did not have the specific intent to kill anyone.",Homicide

He had broken into an office where he once worked and had taken a typewriter that he erroneously believed had been given to him before he was fired.",1,"The correct answer is A. At common law, bigamy is a strict liability crime, and a mistake of fact will not serve as a defense to strict liability crimes. In addition, mistake of law is, in general, never a valid defense. A mistake may only be a valid defense if it creates another defense, or if it acts to negate the mental state requirement of the offense. The defendant in answer A knowingly married a person who was already married, thereby committing the strict liability offense of bigamy, and the defendant's mistaken belief that he was allowed to marry her is no defense.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because a mistake as to the necessity for the use of force to protect oneself may still serve as a defense if the mistake is reasonable. In answer B, the defendant's belief that he was in imminent danger of being killed by the man who was extorting money from him, if it was reasonable, would be a defense to the murder.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because assault with intent to rape is a specific intent crime that requires the intent to commit the rape. Since the defendant's mistake in answer C negates his intent to commit the rape, he should be acquitted of assault with intent to rape.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect because burglary is a specific intent crime that requires the intent to commit a felony or theft. Since the defendant's mistake in answer D negates his intent to commit a felony or theft, he should be acquitted of burglary.

Burglary is defined at common law, as the breaking and entering of a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony therein. If the man reasonably believed he was in the homeowner's house, there would be no intent to commit a felony. The man's reasonable belief that he was in the homeowner's house shows the man did not have the intent to commit a felony in the neighbor's house and is the man's best argument for acquittal.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. The man's mistake regarding which house belonged to the homeowner negates the intent required for burglary. The mistake of law defense only comes into play if there is an official interpretation of the law, or if the statute specifically requires that the defendant know he is violating the law. In this case, there was no mistake of law; it was a factual mistake, and no official legal interpretation was involved. Answer B is incorrect because the man did not, in fact, have the consent of the owner to break into the house that he did; he had consent of the homeowner to break into the homeowner's house. The homeowner's consent does not transfer to the owner of another house, and there is no indication that the owner of the other house consented.

In this case the surgeon is removing the fingerprints from a known safecracker.

Case D illustrates the rule that a defendant would not be guilty as an accomplice for providing a means for an offense to occur when there is a legitimate purpose for providing the good or service.

Attempt consists of two elements: (i) a specific intent to commit the crime; and (ii) an overt act in furtherance of that intent. Regardless of the intent required to complete the crime, attempt is always a specific intent crime. Attempted murder requires the specific intent to kill another person, even though the mens rea for murder itself does not necessarily require a specific intent to kill.

The defendant is guilty of attempted murder despite his mistake of fact as to the man's identity because the mistake does not negate his intent to kill.<br /><br />A and D are incorrect. The defendant's intention to kill his neighbor does not amount to an attempt to commit murder without a voluntary action.

The instruction was wrong. Intent to steal the car would not prove the man knowingly damaged the store.

""Heat of passion"" means there must be legally adequate provocation that caused a sudden and passionate response, which would mitigate the malice aforethought and allow for a finding of voluntary manslaughter. In this case, it is possible for the jury to find that being struck in the face with an umbrella constituted adequate provocation and that the defendant's response was done in the heat of passion. Because there was some evidence presented as to ""heat of passion,"" the jury must be instructed as to voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because it misstates the elements of voluntary manslaughter. If the jury found that the defendant acted with gross recklessness with disregard for human life giving rise to malice aforethought, they should convict of murder, not voluntary manslaughter. Answer C is incorrect because there must only be some evidence presented for the jury to be instructed as to voluntary manslaughter, and that evidence is present in the fact situation. Because it is possible for the jury to find that the defendant acted under adequate provocation, they must be instructed as to voluntary manslaughter. Answer D is incorrect because the fact that the defendant had committed a larceny prior to being struck would not negate the possibility that the jury could find the defendant acted with adequate provocation and under the heat of passion. The defendant raised the possibility of a heat of passion ""defense"" and should be allowed to have the jury instructed as to voluntary manslaughter.",Homicide
"A wife decided to kill her husband because she was tired of his infidelity. She managed to obtain some cyanide, a deadly poison. One evening, she poured wine laced with the cyanide into a glass, handed it to her husband, and proposed a loving toast. The husband was so pleased with the toast that he set the glass of wine down on a table, grabbed his wife, and kissed her passionately. After the kiss, the wife changed her mind about killing the husband. She hid the glass of wine behind a lamp on the table, planning to leave it for the maid to clean up.

"A man who had become very drunk left a bar and started to walk home. Another patron of the bar, who had observed the man's condition, followed him. The patron saw the man stumble and fall to the ground near an alley. The patron then began to pull out a gun but saw that the man had passed out asleep in the gutter. The patron reached into the man's pocket, grabbed his wallet, and started to walk away.

Larceny requires a trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to steal it. All the elements were satisfied here. The asportation (carrying away) element requires movement of only a slight distance, so it was satisfied here even though the patron ultimately discarded the wallet. <br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. The patron could not properly be convicted of robbing the sleeping man because robbery requires a larceny by violence or intimidation. The latter element cannot be satisfied here because the sleeping man was not aware of what was happening. <br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. As explained above, the patron properly could be convicted of the more serious crime of larceny. Thus, even assuming the patron could be convicted of attempted robbery, this offense is not the most serious possible crime of conviction, so the answer is wrong. <br /><br />Answer D is incorrect.

"A statute in a jurisdiction makes it a crime to sell ammunition to a minor (defined as a person under the age of eighteen). The courts have interpreted this statute as creating a strict liability offense that does not require knowledge of the age of the purchaser and as creating vicarious liability. A minor, who was sixteen years old, but looked four or five years older, entered a store and asked a clerk for a box of .22 caliber shells. The store owner had instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors. The clerk asked the minor his age. The minor said he was twenty. The clerk then placed a box of shells on the counter and asked, ""Anything else?"" The minor said that was all he wanted but then discovered he did not have enough money to pay for the shells, so the clerk put the box back onto the shelf.<br /><br />If the owner of the store is charged with attempting to violate the statute, her best argument would be that",multiple-choice,"it was impossible for the sale to have occurred.","she had strictly instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors.","the minor lied about his age.","the clerk did not have the mental state needed for attempt.",4,"The correct answer is D. To be convicted of attempt, a person must have the intent that the crime be committed, and take a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. In this case, the clerk did not have the intent to sell ammunition to minors, and the store owner, as his accessory, should be found not guilty of attempting to sell ammunition to minors.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because it was not, in fact, impossible for the offense to occur and only legal impossibility is a defense to an attempt charge. Although the sale of the ammunition was not completed, that is insufficient for a showing of impossibility, and factual impossibility is not a defense to an attempt charge.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because, even though she instructed her employees not to sell ammunition to minors, the crime is one of strict liability. For strict liability crimes, it does not matter what the store owner's, or the clerk's as her agent, state of mind was. If they sold ammunition to a minor, they would be guilty of the offense. However, for a charge of attempt, there must exist the intent to commit the offense.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because, once again, the crime is one of strict liability. The minor's lie about his age, the clerk's belief of his age, or whether that belief was reasonable, are all irrelevant for strict liability offenses. The store owner's best argument for acquittal would be that, since the clerk had no intent to commit the crime, there can be no proper attempt charge.","Inchoate Crimes"
"A teenager's high school teacher told her that she was going to receive a failing grade in history, which would prevent her from graduating. Furious, she reported to the principal that the teacher had fondled her, and the teacher was fired. A year later, still unable to get work because of the scandal, the teacher committed suicide.

The teacher committed suicide, and the teenager committed no act that was a proximate cause of the teacher's death. A defendant will only be held criminally responsible for the foreseeable consequences of her actions. The suicide by the teacher was not a foreseeable consequence of the teenager's lying.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because a charge of manslaughter does not require proof of intent to kill. Answer C is incorrect because a charge of manslaughter does not require proof of malice, either. Manslaughter is generally defined as causing the death of another without malice aforethought The teenager's lack of intent to kill and her lack of malice are not defenses to a manslaughter charge. Answer D is incorrect because acting under extreme emotional distress generally is not a defense to a manslaughter charge. Unless the teenager could show that she was legally insane, emotional distress may be insufficient to raise a valid defense. The fact that the teacher killed herself and the teenager did not proximately cause that death is the teenager's best defense to the charge of manslaughter.",Homicide

Burglary is defined as the crime of breaking and entering into a structure for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Since merely looking at examination questions is not a crime, and thus not a felony in this fact pattern's jurisdiction, the student cannot be said to have the intent to commit a crime and therefore, does not have the requisite mental state to be guilty of burglary.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because a burglary charge does not require the actual commission of the felony. Breaking and entering with the intent to commit the felony would be sufficient. Although the student did not actually find the questions, he could have been found guilty of burglary if he had the intent to commit a felony.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because the requisite mental state for burglary is having the intent to commit a felony or theft. The fact that the action the student intended to take was not a felony or theft, even though he believed that it was, is a proper defense to a burglary charge.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect because factual impossibility is inapplicable to this situation.

"A defendant entered the county museum at a time when it was open to the public, intending to steal a Picasso etching. Once inside, he took what he thought was the etching from an unlocked display case and concealed it under his coat. However, the etching was a photocopy of an original that had been loaned to another museum. A sign over the display case containing the photocopy said that similar photocopies were available free at the entrance.

In the question's jurisdiction, the charge of burglary requires that the defendant entered the building unlawfully and with the intent to commit a crime. The facts in the question state that the defendant entered the building at a time it was open to the public. Because the defendant's entry was lawful, he did not commit a burglary. Larceny, at common law, requires the taking of personal property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession. The defendant, with the intent to steal, took the photocopy of the etching from its display case and concealed it. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of larceny.<br /><br />Answers A and B are incorrect because the defendant did not commit a burglary as his entry was lawful. Answer D is incorrect because the attempted larceny charge merged into the larceny charge when the defendant actually left with the painting. Despite the fact that the painting was a photocopy, the defendant would not be guilty of attempted larceny.","Other Crimes"
"Four men are being tried for conspiracy to commit a series of bank robberies. Nine successful bank robberies took place during the period of the charged conspiracy. Because the robbers wore masks and gloves and stole the bank surveillance tapes, no witnesses have been able to directly identify the robbers. Some circumstantial evidence ties each of the men to the overall conspiracy. During cross-examination, a prosecution witness testified that one of the men was in jail on other charges during the last six robberies. That man's lawyer has moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case.<br /><br />Should the motion be granted?",multiple-choice,"No, because a conspirator is not required to agree to all of the objects of the conspiracy.","No, because a conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime conspired upon.","Yes, provided the defendant has complied with the rule requiring pretrial notice of alibi.","Yes, regardless of compliance with the alibi rule, because the government is bound by exculpatory evidence elicited during its case-in-chief.",2,"Answer B is correct. At common law, a conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful goal, or to accomplish some lawful goal by unlawful means. A co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. So long as there is an initial agreement among the conspirators to engage in a course of criminal conduct constituting all the crimes, there is only one conspiracy.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. Conspirators must agree on the essential objectives of the conspiracy. In any event, the rationale offered here is inapposite because the problem raised by the question is not failure to agree to the robberies, but not being present during the latter robberies. The defendant's motion for acquittal in this case should be denied because a co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. The defendant is not entitled to acquittal of conspiracy, even if there was compliance with an alibi notice rule. A co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. In this case, even if the defendant showed that he was in prison during several of the robberies, he could be convicted of the conspiracy.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. The defendant is not entitled to acquittal of conspiracy because a co-conspirator need not be present at the commission of each crime, nor does the arrest of one co-conspirator automatically terminate the conspiracy where other co-conspirators continue to carry out the goals of the conspiracy. In this case, even if the evidence showed that the defendant was in prison during several of the robberies, he could be convicted of the conspiracy.

She testified that on March 5, at the time of the robbery, the defendant was with her in a city 300 miles away. On cross-examination, the sister admitted having given a statement to the police in which she had said that the defendant was not with her on March 5, but she claimed that the earlier statement was mistaken. <br /><br />The court instructed the jury that in order to convict the defendant, they had to find all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <br /><br />As to the defendant's claim of alibi, which of the following additional instructions would be proper?",multiple-choice,"Alibi is a matter of defense and so must be established by the defendant; however, the burden of persuasion is by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.","Before you may consider the defendant's claim of alibi, you must decide whether he has produced sufficient evidence to raise the issue.","If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant was present at the convenience store at about 11 p.m. on March 5, you must find him not guilty.","If the defendant's evidence has caused you to have a reasonable doubt as to whether he was the robber, you must find him not guilty.",3,"Answer C is correct. Due process requires the prosecution to prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Because an alibi is not a traditional defense but rather negates an essential element of the crime (the defendant's actual commission thereof), due process precludes imposing upon a defendant the burden of proving an alibi. Thus, Answer C is correct. Answers A and B are incorrect because they treat the alibi like a defense and put the burden of proof on the defendant. Answer D is incorrect because it refers to a reasonable doubt arising from the defendant's evidence, rather than a reasonable doubt arising from the prosecution's lack of evidence to support a conviction.","General Principles"

A charge of conspiracy requires an agreement between at least two individuals with the intent to achieve the objective of the agreement. Because neither the man nor the brother entered the agreement with the intent to commit the larceny, there is no conspiracy to commit the crime, and the cousin cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny.<br /><br />Answers A and B are incorrect because only the cousin entered into the agreement with the intent to achieve the objective of the agreement (larceny). Therefore, there was no true conspiracy between two or more parties. Answer C is incorrect as a misstatement of the law.

Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. A charge of conspiracy requires an agreement that a crime be committed and that at least two of the co-conspirators intend that the crime be committed. The associate did not agree to commit the theft, nor did he help to plan, participate or assist in the theft of the food stamps. Although the associate may be guilty of conspiracy to receive stolen property, he did not agree to steal the food stamps. Therefore, he should not be found guilty of conspiracy to steal food stamps.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the agreement that the associate may have entered into with the man and woman was for the receipt stolen property, not for the commission of theft. At the time of the conversation, the associate was not aware that the theft had not already taken place. The associate did not agree to this theft. Answer B is incorrect; conspiracy punishes the agreement, not the actual commission of the offense. The associate will not be criminally liable for aiding and abetting a conspiracy that he did not intend to be a part of.

The executive committed larceny, but not burglary. Burglary requires the breaking and entering of the building with the intent to commit a felony therein. Burglary was not committed in this situation because the executive did not break in with the intent to commit larceny or any other felony. It was only after breaking that the executive developed the intent to carry away the property of another, and only after returning home that she developed the intent to permanently deprive ownership. For burglary to attach, the executive must have had the complete requisite intent to commit a larceny in the building at the time of entry. The facts state that at the time of entry the executive only intended to claim her own property, so no burglary was committed and A and B are incorrect. She did, however, commit larceny, under the theory of continuing trespass. Therefore, D is incorrect and C is correct.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect.

The defendant asked for an instruction to the effect that if the jury believed that he was influenced by the drug at the time of the crime and would not have committed it otherwise, it had to acquit him.<br /><br />Which of the following circumstances would most aid the defendant's argument in favor of such an instruction?",multiple-choice,"Evidence that the defendant is addicted to this drug and has an overwhelming urge to consume it.","Evidence that the defendant's coach, who gave him the drug, told him it was only an aspirin.","Evidence that the victim of the assault taunted the defendant about his use of the drug immediately before the assault.","Expert testimony that a reasonable person, on consuming this drug, may experience uncontrollable rages.",2,"Answer B is correct. Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another resulting in either an offensive touching or bodily injury. Battery is also a general intent crime. ""General intent"" is an awareness of all the factors constituting the crime. Voluntary intoxication is not a valid defense to a general intent crime. Thus, the most helpful fact supporting an intoxication defense would be evidence that the intoxication was involuntary, which could be shown by evidence demonstrating that the defendant was tricked into taking a substance that he did not know was an intoxicant. Answer B is correct.<br /><br />As stated above, voluntary intoxication would not be a defense to the crime of battery, and the fact that a defendant was addicted to a drug does not make intoxication with that drug involuntary for purposes of the criminal law. Thus, Answer A is incorrect.<br /><br />Nor would the victim's taunting constitute a valid defense. The victim's taunting would not support an intoxication instruction, which would be proper only if there was evidence showing that the intoxication was involuntary.

Using a prior judicial decision as binding authority requires that the two cases be factually analogous and involve the same legal issues. The case in the question involves the taking of property of another when the ultimate intent of the thief is to obtain money.

The legal issue was whether a conviction is proper when the property taken was taken in an attempt to obtain further money. Answer A is correct.<br /><br />In answer B, there was no intent to permanently deprive the owner, and no attempt to convert that property to money. Answer B is incorrect. Answer C deals with a breach of a deal to take possession of real property. Answer C is incorrect. Answer D deals with obtaining lawful possession of property using fraud and then selling the property, which, at common law, would be embezzlement.

Voluntary intoxication is only a defense to specific intent crimes and only applies if the intoxication negates the requisite mental state for the charge. The defendant in answer B could not have intended to assault with intent to kill if his intoxication did not allow him to realize that anyone was around. Therefore, the defendant will likely be found not guilty.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. The defendant's intoxication did not negate his intent to drive, and will provide no defense to the manslaughter charge.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. While armed robbery is generally considered a specific intent crime, the defendant's intoxication did not negate the defendant's intent to commit the robbery, and only made him uncertain about the gun.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. Statutory rape is not a specific intent crime, and does not require the defendant to know that the girl was under the age of 16.

"A foreign diplomat discovered that a small person could enter a particular jewelry store by crawling through an air vent. The diplomat befriended a woman he met in a bar who he believed was small enough to crawl through the air vent. Without telling her that he was a diplomat, he explained how she could get into the jewelry store. She agreed to help him burglarize the store. Someone overheard their conversation and reported it to the police. Shortly thereafter, the police arrested the diplomat and the woman. Both were charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. <br /><br />Before trial, the diplomat moved to dismiss the charge against him on the ground that he was entitled to diplomatic immunity. The court granted his motion. The woman then moved to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her. <br /><br />The jurisdiction has adopted the Model Penal Code version of conspiracy. <br /><br />Should the court grant the woman's motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge against her?",multiple-choice,"No, because the diplomat's defense does not negate any element of the crime.","No, because the woman was not aware of the diplomat's status.","Yes, because a conspiracy requires two guilty participants.","Yes, because but for the diplomat's conduct, no conspiracy would have occurred.",1,"Answer A is correct. Model Penal Code section 5.03(1) adopts a unilateral interpretation of conspiracy, defining conspiracy as requiring agreement by the defendant but not by two or more persons. The defendant can be convicted of conspiracy regardless of whether the other parties have all been acquitted or were only feigning agreement. In addition, many jurisdictions that require a bilateral conspiracy still allow conviction if one of the co-conspirators agreed to the crime but cannot be convicted based on lack of capacity or some other defense personal to the co-conspirator. Thus, Answer A is correct because the diplomat's defense will not negate the fact that the woman agreed to commit burglary. Answer C is incorrect because, as stated above, under the Model Penal Code's unilateral approach to conspiracy, a defendant may be found guilty of conspiracy even if the other conspirators are all acquitted or assert valid personal defenses. <br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. The woman would not be entitled to dismissal even if she knew of the diplomat's status, because the diplomat's capacity to be convicted of the crime would be irrelevant to her possible conviction in a jurisdiction that has adopted the unilateral view of conspiracy set out in the Model Penal Code. <br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. The woman properly can be convicted because, regardless of the diplomat's immunity, she agreed to commit a crime. The fact that the diplomat's conduct was a but-for cause of the conspiracy is irrelevant because the diplomat was not a government agent, and in any event there is no basis for finding that he entrapped her.","Inchoate Crimes"
"An eighteen-year-old boyfriend and his 14-year-old girlfriend made plans to meet in the boyfriend's apartment to have sexual intercourse, and they did so. The girlfriend later told her mother about the incident. The boyfriend was charged with statutory rape and conspiracy to commit statutory rape.<br /><br />In the jurisdiction, the age of consent is 15, and the law of conspiracy is the same as at common law.<br /><br />The boyfriend was convicted of both charges and given consecutive sentences. On appeal, he contends that his conspiracy conviction should be reversed. <br /><br />That conviction should be",multiple-choice,"affirmed, because he agreed with the girlfriend to commit the crime.","reversed, because the girlfriend could not be a conspirator to this crime.","reversed, because the crime is one that can only be committed by agreement and thus Wharton's Rule bars conspiracy liability.","reversed, because one cannot conspire with a person too young to consent.",2,"The correct answer is B. Because the charge of statutory rape is meant to protect minor children, and the girlfriend is a member of the protected class, the girlfriend cannot be charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit statutory rape. Because it is impossible for the girlfriend to commit the crime, she cannot be a conspirator to the crime, and the boyfriend's conviction for conspiracy should be reversed.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because a conspiracy charge not only requires that there be an agreement, but also that both parties be capable of committing the offense. Because the girlfriend cannot be a conspirator to statutory rape, the boyfriend cannot be convicted of conspiring with her.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because Wharton's rule only applies in cases where the crime to be committed is one that, by definition requires the voluntary concerted criminal participation of two persons. Statutory rape can be committed without the voluntary concerted criminal participation of the minor victim. Because statutory rape can be committed by only one of the participants, Wharton's rule does not apply.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect because it is possible to conspire with a minor to commit a crime. The reason the girlfriend cannot be a conspirator is because she is the protected victim, not because she is presumed incapable of consenting. Because the boyfriend was convicted of conspiring with someone who is incapable of committing the underlying charge, his conviction should be reversed.","Inchoate Crimes"
"The defendant became intoxicated at a bar. He got into his car and drove away. Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped his car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, the defendant turned and struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, the defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street.<br /><br />Relevant statutes define burglary to include ""breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein."" Manslaughter is defined as the ""killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner."" Criminal recklessness is defined as ""consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct."" Murder is defined as the ""the premeditated and intentional killing of another or the killing of another during the commission of a rape, robbery, burglary, or arson."" Another statute provides that intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense.<br /><br />The defendant was charged with the murder of the watchman and manslaughter of the pedestrian.

According to the statute, manslaughter is defined as the killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner, and criminal recklessness is defined as ""consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk resulting from the actor's conduct."" The mens rea requirement for manslaughter is therefore, that the defendant ""consciously"" disregarded the risks of his conduct. Since intoxication is a defense if it negates an element of the offense, if the defendant was too intoxicated to ""consciously"" disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk, he should be found not guilty of manslaughter as defined by statute.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. While criminal law does not punish actions that are involuntary, at common law, and in the statute, voluntary intoxication does not mitigate the voluntariness of an action taken while intoxicated.

"A defendant and a sports fan were engaged in a heated discussion over the relative merits of their favorite professional football teams when the defendant said, ""You have to be one of the dumbest people around."" The sports fan slapped the defendant. The defendant drew a knife and stabbed the sports fan in the stomach. Other people then stepped in and stopped any further fighting. Despite the pleas of the other people, the sports fan refused to go to a hospital or to seek medical treatment. About two hours later, he died as the result of a loss of blood. The defendant was charged with the murder of the sports fan. At trial, medical evidence established that if the sports fan had been taken to a hospital, he would have survived.<br /><br />At the end of the case, the defendant moves for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for an instruction on the elements of voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br />The court should",multiple-choice,"grant the motion for acquittal.","deny the motion for acquittal, but instruct on manslaughter because there is evidence of adequate provocation.","deny both motions, because the defendant failed to retreat.","deny both motions, because malice may be proved by the intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body.",2,"The correct answer is B. The defendant's motion for acquittal should be denied because there is sufficient evidence for the jury to find the defendant guilty of murder. The sports fan's refusal to seek medical treatment is an insufficient intervening act to allow the defendant to escape criminal liability for stabbing the sports fan. Whether an intervening act is sufficient to break the chain of causality in a homicide case rests on the foreseeability of the intervening act. A defendant will be held criminally responsible for the foreseeable consequences of his actions; however, if an unforeseeable act intervenes, a defendant will not be deemed responsible for the death. The defendant stabbed the sports fan in the stomach, and as a result of the injury, the sports fan died. A refusal to get medical treatment by the victim is foreseeable and is insufficient to allow the defendant to escape criminal responsibility for his actions. The motion for judgment of acquittal should be denied.<br /><br />A jury should be instructed as to voluntary manslaughter if there is at least some evidence that the murder was done in the ""heat of passion."" In this case, the sports fan's slapping the defendant may be considered adequate provocation, and a reasonable jury could find that the defendant was acting in the ""heat of passion"" when he stabbed the sports fan. Because there is some evidence such that a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the jury should be instructed on that issue.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the sports fan's refusal to obtain medical treatment will not break the chain of causality, and there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find him guilty of murder. Answer C is incorrect because the defendant, even if he did not retreat, could still be found to have acted in the ""heat of passion"" as a result of adequate provocation. Answer D is incorrect because, although malice may be proved by the intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, there was still some evidence presented that the defendant did so in the ""heat of passion.""

"After being fired from his job, a defendant drank almost a quart of vodka and decided to ride the bus home. While on the bus, he saw a briefcase he mistakenly thought was his own, and began struggling with the passenger carrying the briefcase. The defendant knocked the passenger to the floor, took the briefcase, and fled. The defendant was arrested and charged with robbery.<br /><br />The defendant should be",multiple-choice,"acquitted, because he used no threats and was intoxicated.","acquitted, because his mistake negated the required specific intent.","convicted, because his intoxication was voluntary.","convicted, because mistake is no defense to robbery.",2,"The correct answer is B. Robbery is the taking of the personal property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, by force or threat of force. The defendant's mistaken belief that the briefcase was his negated his intention to permanently deprive the owner of the property. He believed he was the owner and that it was his property. Because the defendant did not have the requisite mens rea (in this case, specific intent to deprive), he should be acquitted of the charge of robbery.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because, although he did not use the threat of force, he did use actual force by struggling with the passenger and pushing him to the floor, and robbery can be committed through either threat of force or actual force. In addition, intoxication, by itself, is not a defense to a crime. Only when the intoxication negates the requisite mental state can it be a defense to a criminal charge.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because, although his intoxication was voluntary, he still lacked the requisite mental state to make the actions he took criminal. He believed the briefcase was his, and he had no intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property.<br /><br />Answer D is a misstatement of the law and ignores the fact that a mistake can negate the specific intent necessary to commit a robbery. The defendant's mistaken belief that he was the owner of the property negated the specific intent necessary for a proper robbery charge and he should be acquitted.","General Principles"
"The general manager and chief executive officer of a knitting mill delegated all operational decision making to the supervising manager of the mill. The child labor laws in the jurisdiction provide, ""It is a violation of the law for one to employ a person under the age of 17 years for full-time labor."" Without the general manager's knowledge, the supervising manager hired a number of 15- and 16-year-olds to work at the mill full time. He did not ask their ages and they did not disclose them. The supervising manager could have discovered their ages easily by asking for identification, but he did not do so because he was not aware of the law and believed that company policy was to hire young people.<br /><br />If the statute is interpreted to create strict liability and the general manager is convicted of violating it, his contention that his conviction would violate the federal Constitution is",multiple-choice,"correct, because it is a violation of due procees to punish without a voluntary act.","correct, because criminal liability is personal and the knitting mill is the employer of the children, not the general manager.","incorrect, because regulatory offenses are not subject to due process limitations.","incorrect, because he was in a position to exercise control over the hiring employees for the knitting mill.",4,"The correct answer is D. Because the general manager is the CEO and the person who delegated the authority to the supervising manager, he will bear criminal responsibility for the actions of his agents who are acting on his behalf. Because the general manager had control over the hiring of employees for the knitting mill, and he delegated that authority to the supervising manager, he is responsible for the actions taken in the hiring of children by his agent. The offense is a strict liability crime and neither the general manager nor the supervising manager needs to have actual knowledge that the children were under the age of 17.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the general manager is criminally responsible for the actions of his agents; there is no violation of due process even if he did not do the act of hiring the children himself. Assigning the responsibility to his agent was a sufficient actus reus for criminal liability. Answer B is incorrect because corporate officers, such as the general manager and the supervising manager, can be held criminally liable for strict liability crimes involving corporations. Although the named employer is the knitting mill, the supervising manager, as the hirer, and the general manager, as his superior, will bear responsibility for those corporate actions in strict liability crimes. Answer C is incorrect because even regulatory offenses are subject to certain due process limitations. Because the general manager had the authority to hire the children, and he specifically delegated that authority to the supervising manager, he will bear criminal responsibility for the supervising manager's actions that violated the strict liability crime of hiring children.","General Principles"
"A two-year-old child became ill with meningitis. Her parents were members of a group who believed fervently that if they prayed enough, God would not permit their child to die.

The parents' best defense to the murder charge is that they did not act with the intent to kill or harm their child, and therefore they did not have malice aforethought necessary for a murder conviction. Failure to seek medical attention for an illness is generally insufficient for the finding of malice aforethought, so the parents, since they did not intend to kill or harm their child, in their criminal negligence may have committed involuntary manslaughter, but not murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because acting pursuant to constitutionally protected religious beliefs will not serve as a defense to an otherwise criminal act. Answer C is incorrect because they owed a duty of care to their child, and her death was a foreseeable consequence of their refusal to seek medical treatment. Their inaction contributed to the illness, and was thus a ""proximate"" cause of their child's death. Answer D is incorrect because it misstates the requirements for a murder charge at common law. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought, not with premeditation and deliberation. The parents' best defense to the charge of murder is that their lack of intent to kill or harm their child means they did not have the requisite malice aforethought for a murder conviction.",Homicide
"The defendant was charged with the murder of his wife. In his defense, he testified that at the time he killed her he believed that his wife was planning to destroy the world by detonating a massive explosive device that she had developed and built in the basement of their home. He further testified that he had tried many times to dissuade his wife from her plan and had tried to destroy devices that she stored in the basement. She had, he testified, foiled his efforts by, on two occasions, signing papers for his hospitalization, which lasted for a brief period each time. He said that he had concluded that the only way to prevent her scheme was to kill her and that he had become so obsessed with the importance of doing so that he could think of nothing else.

The defendant's best defense to a murder charge is that he was insane at the time of the killing. The defendant's testimony shows that at the time of the killing, he was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know that what he was doing was wrong. The defendant's testimony indicates he had been involuntarily committed twice, was delusional and obsessed, and thought his actions were necessary to save the world. His best defense is insanity.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the defendant did have the requisite mental state for murder; he had the intent to kill his wife. Even though, in his delusions, he thought it was necessary to save the world, he still intended to kill his wife, so he did have the requisite mental state for murder. Answer B is incorrect because the defendant did meet the requisite act element; he caused her death by pushing her down the steps. Answer D is incorrect because belief alone that he was acting in defense of the planet is insufficient to justify killing his wife. That belief, and the force used, must be reasonable. In light of the unreasonableness of the defendant's delusions that his wife was going to destroy the world, the defendant's defense of others claim would probably fail.

Using a prior judicial decision as binding authority requires that the two cases be factually analogous and involve the same legal issues. The factual situation in the question indicates that the man took the property of his neighbor with the intent to return the property, but that intention was subsequently frustrated by an intervening event. The legal issue is whether this lack of intent to permanently deprive the owner is sufficient to preclude a conviction for larceny. The case in answer B is the most factually analogous and deals with the same legal issue as those raised in the man's case. The defendants in answer B took the property of another with the intent to return it, but a car crash frustrated their intent to return the car. Therefore, B provides the most applicable precedent. <br /><br />In answer A, the legal issue was whether a conviction is proper when the property taken was taken in an attempt to obtain further money. Answer C deals with a breach of a deal to take possession of real property. Answer D deals with obtaining lawful possession of property using fraud, and then selling the property.

A charge of solicitation is completed once the person invites, requests, commands, hires, or encourages another to commit a particular offense with the intent that the offense be committed. In this case, the man is guilty of the solicitation when he requested that the undercover officer kill his girlfriend's parents.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the man's attempt to withdraw was done after the solicitation occurred. His later withdrawal is not a valid defense to his original solicitation. Answer B is incorrect because the only act necessary for a solicitation charge is the request to commit the crime; it is not necessary that the crime actually be committed or that steps be taken to commit the crime. Answer D is incorrect because the solicited party does not need to agree to commit the offense for the solicitation to be completed. The man, by hiring the undercover officer to commit the murder, is guilty of solicitation to commit murder.

The most serious offense for which the man could properly be convicted of is murder. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought exists where the defendant acted with one of the following mental states: (i) intent to kill, (ii) intent to inflict great bodily injury, (iii)reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (acting with a ""depraved heart""), or (iv) intent to commit a felony (felony murder). The man could properly be convicted of murder, even though he lacked specific intent to kill, because his conduct created such a high risk of death and was so devoid of social utility that he could be found to have acted with a depraved heart. <br /><br />Answer B is incorrect.

If the defendant did not have the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, the defendant cannot be found guilty of larceny. Answer B is incorrect. If the defendant honestly believes that he is entitled to the money or property of another for the payment of a debt, then the defendant will not have the intent to take the property of another. The defendant in answer B believed he had a valid claim to the property, and thus lacked the requisite intent to commit larceny. Answer D is incorrect. Larceny is a specific intent crime.

"An employee worked at a day-care center run by the Happy Faced Day Care Corporation. At the center, one of the young children often arrived with bruises and welts on his back and legs. A statute in the jurisdiction requires all day-care workers to report to the police cases where there is probable cause to suspect child abuse and provides for immediate removal from the home of any suspected child abuse victims. The employee was not aware of this statute. Nevertheless, he did report the child's condition to his supervisor, who advised him to keep quiet about it so the day-care center would not get into trouble for defaming a parent. About two weeks after the employee first noticed the child's condition, the child was beaten to death by his father. The employee has been charged with murder in the death of the child. The evidence at trial disclosed, in addition to the above, that the child had been the victim of beatings by the father for some time, and that these earlier beatings had been responsible for the marks that the employee had seen. The child's mother had been aware of the beatings but had not stopped them because she was herself afraid of the child's father.<br /><br />The employee's best argument that he is NOT guilty of murder is",multiple-choice,"he was not aware of the duty-to-report statute.","he lacked the mental state necessary to the commission of the crime.","his omission was not the proximate cause of death.","the day-care corporation, rather than the employee, was guilty of the omission, which was sanctioned by its supervisory-level agent.",2,"The correct answer is B. The employee will not bear criminal responsibility for the actions of another unless he intended that those actions be committed and he aided and abetted in the commission of the offense. Because the employee never intended that the child be murdered, he should be found not guilty.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because it is not the best argument for the employee to be found not guilty, and the employee's awareness of the duty-to-report statute is irrelevant to whether or not he will bear criminal responsibility for the actions of another. Answer C is incorrect because it is not the best argument to be found not guilty, and because it is possible that the child's death was foreseeable by the employee's failure to act. It is possible that, if the murder was foreseeable, then the employee's inaction may be considered a proximate cause of death. Answer D is incorrect because the burden is on the employee to report to the authorities, not to his corporation, and because the employee's guilt or innocence as to the failure to report statute is, at best, incidental to the determination of guilt as to the murder. The employee's best argument is that he was not criminally responsible for the actions of the child's father.","Inchoate Crimes"

The defendant's pointing a loaded weapon at the victim and pulling the trigger posed a great threat of serious bodily injury to the victim, and, because it resulted in the victim's death, the defendant should be convicted of murder in the second degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with malice aforethought, done without premeditation and deliberation. The defendant's actions were done with reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, and will support a finding of malice aforethought. <br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because there is no evidence that the defendant intended to kill the victim. Because the statute defines first degree murder as the premeditated and intentional killing of another, and there is no evidence that the defendant intended to kill the victim, she will not be convicted of murder in the first degree. In addition, answer A is also incorrect because the underlying felony in a felony murder charge must be sufficiently independent of the actual killing. In this case, the underlying felony of assault with a deadly weapon would merge into the homicide charge and would not be independent enough to allow for a proper felony murder charge. The defendant cannot be properly convicted of first degree murder under either theory.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because manslaughter is not the most serious crime for which the defendant can properly be convicted. In addition, the defendant's actions were beyond mere negligence, and the killing of the victim was done with malice aforethought.

"The defendant became intoxicated at a bar. He got into his car and drove away. Within a few blocks, craving another drink, he stopped his car in the middle of the street, picked up a brick, and broke the display window of a liquor store. As he was reaching for a bottle, the night watchman arrived. Startled, the defendant turned and struck the watchman on the head with the bottle, killing him. Only vaguely aware of what was happening, the defendant returned to his car, consumed more liquor, and then drove off at a high speed. He ran a red light and struck and killed a pedestrian who was crossing the street.<br /><br />Relevant statutes define burglary to include ""breaking and entering a building not used as a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein."" Manslaughter is defined as the ""killing of a human being in a criminally reckless manner.""

The defendant is charged with murder, which means the state must prove either 1) the defendant premeditated and intentionally killed the watchman, or, 2) the murder occurred in the commission of a burglary. As the statute outlines, intoxication is not a defense to a crime unless it negates an element of the offense. Therefore, intoxication would be available as a defense to the burglary charge if it negated the element that the defendant had the intent to commit a theft when he broke and entered the building. Since there are two ways for the jury to possibly find the defendant guilty of murder, the jury must be instructed that the felony-murder way of charging would be unproven if they believed that the defendant was not guilty, by reason of his intoxication, of the burglary, AND the jury must be instructed that, if they so find, the state must prove the defendant premeditated and intentionally killed the watchman. Thus, answer A is correct. The statute regarding intoxication, which controls over common law, indicates it could be a defense to the specific intent crime of burglary, so the jury must be instructed as to the possibility of that defense on the underlying charge of burglary. Without the underlying felony burglary charge, the defendant cannot be found guilty of felony murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. The jury, as fact finders, could easily find that the defendant did kill the watchman in the course of the commission of burglary, despite his intoxication, and so they must be instructed as to the availability of the felony murder charge. Answer C ignores the felony-murder method of committing murder and is thus incorrect. Answer D misstates the requirements for the intoxication defense by applying a ""but for"" test rather than the statutory requirements. When the jury is instructed, they must be allowed to consider both methods of committing the offense of murder and that intoxication is a defense to the burglary charge which, in turn, could negate the felony-murder charge.",Homicide

In jurisdictions that recognize unilateral conspiracies, it is enough that one person agree with another person to commit a crime (and in some jurisdictions, that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement be committed). It is no defense to unilateral conspiracy that the other person was feigning agreement or acting in an undercover capacity. Therefore, the man's lack of intent does not make the woman any less guilty. <br /><br />B is incorrect. In jurisdictions that recognize unilateral conspiracies, it is enough that one person agree with another person to commit a crime (and in some jurisdictions, that an overt act in furtherance of that agreement be committed). It is no defense to unilateral conspiracy that the other person was feigning agreement or acting in an undercover capacity.

This question deals with the impossibility defenses to an attempt charge. Factual impossibility is not a defense to an attempt charge. However, legal impossibility is a defense. Factual impossibility arises when the defendant unsuccessfully takes a criminal action, whereas legal impossibility arises when the intended action is not actually a crime. Answer C is the only example of legal impossibility given and is the correct answer. In answer C, the defendant attempted a legal act, so he will be found not guilty.<br /><br />In answers A, B, and D, if the facts had been as the defendant believed them to be, then a crime would have been committed.

"A professional poker player had cheated a man in a card game. Angered, the man set out for the poker player's house with the intention of shooting him. Just as he was about to set foot on the poker player's property, the man was arrested by a police officer who noticed that the man was carrying a revolver. A statute in the jurisdiction makes it a crime to ""enter the property of another with the intent to commit any crime of violence thereon.""<br /><br />If charged with attempting to violate the statute, the man should be found",multiple-choice,"not guilty, because the statute defines an attempted crime and there cannot be an attempt to attempt.","not guilty, because to convict him would be to punish him simply for having a guilty mind.","guilty, because he was close enough to entering the property and he had the necessary state of mind.","guilty, because this is a statute designed to protect the public from violence, and the man was dangerous.",3,"The correct answer is C. To be found guilty of attempt to commit a crime, one must have the intent that the crime be committed and take a substantial step towards its commission. In this question, the statutory crime is to enter the property of another with the intent to commit any crime of violence thereon. The question indicates that the man clearly had the intent to shoot the poker player, and the man clearly had the intent to enter the poker player's property to do so. Obtaining the weapon and going over to the poker player's house are substantial steps towards the commission of the statutory offense. The man intended to enter the poker player's property in order to cause violence and took substantial steps toward the commission of that offense; thus, he should be convicted of attempt to commit the offense.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the crime listed in the statute punishes the entry of property with the intent to commit a crime of violence. The statute does not define an attempt crime. It is a crime of its own, separate and apart from any other attempt to commit violence and is defined by the action of entering property of another with the requisite mental state.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the attempt to commit the statutory offense does not punish the defendant simply for having a guilty mind. The defendant must also take substantial steps towards the commission of the offense. There is an actus reus requirement for all attempt charges, including this offense. In this case, the man's obtaining the gun and setting out for the poker player's house were sufficient actions for a conviction of attempt.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect because the policy behind the statute and the dangerousness of the man are not sufficient reasons to convict the man of a crime. The man must have actually committed the offense. The man, with the intent to cause violence to the poker player, attempted to enter the poker player's property, and therefore should be convicted of attempting to violate the statutory offense.","Inchoate Crimes"

He put his hand into his pocket and growled, ""Give me the money or I'll start shooting."" The attendant, who knew the man as a neighborhood character, did not believe that he was violent or had a gun. However, because he felt sorry for the man, he handed over the cash.

The man attempted to take the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, by the threat of force. The man had the intent to commit a robbery, and took substantial steps, by putting his hand in his pocket and threatening the attendant, toward the commission of that robbery. Although it was factually impossible for the man to have committed robbery, because the attendant was not afraid and gave the money to the man out of sympathy rather than because of force or the threat of force, factual impossibility is not a defense to an attempt charge. The man committed attempted robbery.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the man did not commit a robbery. The attendant did not give the man the money because of force or the threat of force, but rather because he felt sorry for the man. A conviction for robbery requires the money be given due to force or the threat of force, and not because of sympathy.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because, at common law, false pretenses requires the obtaining of the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation. Regardless of whether the check was properly endorsed, the man did not obtain the money through fraud, but rather through the sympathy of the attendant. Therefore, he did not commit false pretenses.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect for the same reason. At common law, larceny by trick is obtaining the possession, with the owner's consent, of the property of another by fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. The attendant did not give away the property because of misrepresentation, but rather sympathy. The man, however, did have the intent to commit a robbery, and took substantial steps towards the commission of the offense, and is most likely guilty of attempted robbery.","Inchoate Crimes"

Felony-murder is a death that is caused in the commission of, or in an attempt to commit an inherently dangerous felony. The common law felony murder doctrine recognizes arson, burglary, rape, robbery, kidnapping, etc. as qualifying underlying offenses (modern statutes have expanded on the traditional common law felony-murder definition to include additional felonies). Arson is an inherently dangerous felony that may serve as the basis for a felony-murder conviction. In this case, the friend intentionally burnt the building, and the owner, as an accomplice to the burning, may be held responsible for the friend’s actions, including the resulting death. Therefore, A is correct.<br /><br />B is incorrect, because fraud is not an underlying offense recognized by the felony murder doctrine. The common law felony murder doctrine applies to inherently dangerous felonies, including arson, burglary, rape, robbery, kidnapping, etc. Fraud is not an inherently dangerous felony, and therefore, cannot serve as a basis for a felony-murder conviction.<br /><br />C is incorrect because conspiracy is not an underlying offense recognized by the felony murder doctrine (which traditionally recognizes arson, burglary, rape, robbery, kidnapping, etc. to be qualifying underlying inherently dangerous offenses). Conspiracy is not an inherently dangerous felony, and therefore, cannot serve as a basis for a felony-murder conviction.<br /><br />D is incorrect. The common law elements of burglary are: (i) breaking; (ii) and entering; (iii) of a dwelling; (iv) of another; (v) at nighttime; (vi) with the intent to commit a felony therein.

In the present case, the friend’s actions do not amount to a “breaking.” The friend had the owner’s permission to enter the building, and could have used any means possible to do so, including through the use of force.

"Which of the following is LEAST likely to be the underlying felony in a prosecution for felony murder?",multiple-choice,Arson.,Manslaughter.,"Attempted rape.",Burglary.,2,"The correct answer is B. At common law, the underlying felony in a prosecution for felony murder must be sufficiently different from the facts and circumstances of the murder so as to not merge with the murder charge. Manslaughter is a lesser-included offense of murder, and has many, if not all, of the same elements as murder, and will merge into the murder offense if it is used as the underlying felony for felony murder. Thus, manslaughter will not be a proper underlying felony for a prosecution for felony murder.<br /><br />Answers A, C, and D are incorrect because, at common law, arson, attempted rape, and burglary are all felonies, are all inherently dangerous enough for felony murder to apply, and will all not merge into the murder offense.

"A state statute makes it a felony for any teacher at a state institution of higher education to accept anything of value from a student at the same institution.

The teacher and the student are tried jointly for violation of the state statute. The teacher is charged with violating the statute and the student with aiding and abetting him.<br /><br />The student's best argument for a dismissal of the charge against him is that",multiple-choice,"a principal and an accessory cannot be tried together, since the principal must be convicted first.","he cannot be an accessory, since he is the victim of the crime.","the legislature did not intend to punish the person giving the thing of value.","he did not assist the teacher in violating the statute.",3,"C is correct. The best argument the student has is that the statute, by its wording, excludes him as a possible party to the crime, so he cannot be held criminally responsible. For this argument to work, the statute must, by its nature, involve two necessary parties to the crime, with only one of the parties identified in the statute. If the statute leaves the other one unnamed and unpunished, courts will hold that the legislature did not intend to punish the second necessary party, and he thus cannot be liable as an accessory. When a statute specifically names only one party as being criminally liable when there must be at least 2 or more actors to commit the offense, there is a clear indication that the legislature did not intend the other actor to be punished, and a court will not hold that other actor criminally liable. That is the student's best argument for a dismissal here. Answer C is correct.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect; a principal and an accessory can be tried together, and an accessory can be convicted without the principal even being charged. Answer B is incorrect because the statutory offense is not a crime against a person or property, and the student is not the victim; he is a participant in the bribery. Answer D is incorrect because by making the offer, and giving the teacher the money, the student's actions clearly assisted the teacher in the commission of the offense.

Accessory-after-the-fact is a separate crime, and can be used to prosecute a person for aid given to a defendant after the crime was completed. Answer C is incorrect because the woman need not have known that the man had been indicted, as long as the woman knew that her aid was to prevent his prosecution or punishment. If the jury finds that the woman, in helping the man and the daughter move, was attempting to aid the man in avoiding prosecution or punishment for the crime, they can convict her as an accessory-after-the-fact.","General Principles"
"A defendant wanted to kill his neighbor because the defendant believed his neighbor was having an affair with his wife. Early one morning, armed with a pistol, he crouched behind some bushes on a park hillside overlooking a path upon which his neighbor frequently jogged. On this morning, however, the defendant saw his neighbor jogging on another path about a half mile away. Unaware of the limited range of his pistol, the defendant fired five shots at his neighbor. None of the five shots came anywhere close to the neighbor as he was well out of the range.<br /><br />The defendant is",multiple-choice,"guilty of attempted murder, because he was not aware of the limited range of his pistol.","guilty of attempted murder, because a reasonable person would not have been aware of the limited range of his pistol.","not guilty of attempted murder, or any lesser included offense, because, under the circumstances, it was impossible for him to have killed his neighbor.","not guilty of attempted murder, but guilty of assault.",1,"The correct answer is A. To be found guilty of attempted murder, a defendant must have the intent to commit murder, and take a substantial step toward the commission of murder. In this question, the defendant had, prior to the shooting, the intent to kill his neighbor, and took the substantial step of firing the weapon at the neighbor. He is guilty of attempted murder. However, if the defendant was aware that it was impossible for his shots to actually reach his neighbor, it cannot be said that the defendant, by shooting at his neighbor, had the intent and took a substantial step to kill the neighbor. However, because the defendant was unaware of the limited range of his pistol he can be convicted of attempted murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the standard applied is the actual intent of the defendant and the substantiality of the step taken; it doesn't matter what a reasonable person would know with respect to the range of the pistol. Answer C is incorrect because only legal impossibility, not factual impossibility, is a defense to an attempt charge. Although it was impossible for the defendant to kill his neighbor, he still had the intent to kill him and took a substantial step toward doing so. This is a case of factual impossibility, and is not a defense to an attempt charge. Answer D is incorrect because the defendant is guilty of attempted murder, as well as assault.","Inchoate Crimes"
"A defendant was charged with assault and battery in a jurisdiction that followed the ""retreat"" doctrine, and he pleaded self-defense. At his trial, the evidence established the following: A man and his wife were enjoying a drink at a tavern when the defendant entered and stood near the door. The wife whispered to her husband that the defendant was the man who had insulted her on the street the day before. The husband approached the defendant and said, ""Get out of here, or I'll break your nose."" The defendant said, ""Don't come any closer, or I'll hurt you."" When the husband raised his fists menacingly, the defendant pulled a can of pepper spray from his pocket, aimed it at the husband's face, and sprayed. The husband fell to the floor, writhing in pain.<br /><br />Should the defendant be convicted?",multiple-choice,"No, because he had no obligation to retreat before resorting to nondeadly force.","No, because there is no obligation to retreat when one is in an occupied structure.","Yes, because he failed to retreat even though there was an opportunity available.","Yes, because the husband did not threaten to use deadly force against him.",1,"Answer A is correct. The majority rule is that there is no duty to retreat prior to using deadly force. The non-aggressor may use deadly force in self-defense even if the use of deadly force could be avoided by retreating. However, the question states that the jurisdiction follows the ""retreat"" rule. In such a jurisdiction, a non-aggressor may use deadly force only after making a proper retreat. No retreat is necessary if it cannot be made in complete safety. Additionally, there is no obligation to retreat unless the defender intends to use deadly force. Here, the accused used pepper spray on the victim--a nondeadly force--and therefore there was no need to retreat.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the defendant should not be convicted, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. The reason the defendant was not required to retreat was because he used nondeadly force and not because he was in an occupied structure.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. As explained above, even where safe retreat is possible, it is not required before using nondeadly force in self-defense.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. A response of nondeadly force is justified where the defender reasonably believes the other is about to inflict unlawful bodily harm, which need not be deadly harm.","Other Crimes"
"A defendant is charged with assault and battery. The state's evidence shows that the victim was struck in the face by the defendant's fist. In which of the following situations is the defendant most likely to be not guilty of assault and battery?",multiple-choice,"The defendant had been hypnotized at a party and ordered by the hypnotist to strike the person he disliked the most.","The defendant was suffering from an epileptic seizure and had no control over his motions.","The defendant was heavily intoxicated and was shadow boxing without realizing that the victim was near him.","The defendant, who had just awakened from a deep sleep, was not fully aware of what was happening and mistakenly thought the victim was attacking him.",2,"The correct answer is B. Assault and battery both require an act. The act can be any bodily movement, but it must be voluntary. The defendant having the epileptic seizure had no control over his movements, so his act of striking the victim was not voluntary and he will be found not guilty of assault and battery. A is not the best answer because there is a jurisdictional split about whether hypnosis is sufficient to negate volition, and thus actus reus, with the majority declining the recognize hypnosis as a valid defense. C is incorrect because even though the defendant was intoxicated, his movements while shadow boxing were still voluntary. D is incorrect. Although an act performed while sleeping or unconscious will not be considered voluntary, here the defendant has awakened and his striking of the victim can still be considered voluntary.","General Principles"
"A man, despondent and angry over losing his job, was contemplating suicide. With his revolver in his pocket, he went to a bar and drank until he was very intoxicated. He overheard a customer on the next barstool telling the bartender how it was necessary for companies to downsize in order to keep the economy strong. The man turned to the customer and said, ""Why don't you shut the hell up."" The customer responded, ""This is a free country, and I can say what I want,"" all the while shaking his finger at the man.

While the man's intoxication prevented the kind of ""cool reflection"" required for first-degree murder, it did not preclude the mental state required for second-degree murder.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. There was no reasonable explanation for the man becoming enraged. Although his intoxication prevented the kind of ""cool reflection"" required for first-degree murder, it did not preclude the mental state required for second-degree murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. Even assuming that deliberation can be instantaneous, the man's intoxicated anger prevented the kind of ""cool reflection"" required for deliberation. However, while his intoxication prevented the mental state required for first-degree murder, it did not preclude the mental state required for second-degree murder.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect.

"Driving down a dark road, the defendant accidentally ran over a man. The defendant stopped and found that the victim was dead.

Robbery is the taking of property of another, by use of force or the threat of force, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. There must be a nexus between the force or threat of force and the taking. Larceny is the taking and carrying away of the property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. In this question, the defendant took property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property, and, although there was force used on the victim, there was no nexus between the taking and the use of force. The defendant, by taking the personal property of the victim and having the intent to permanently deprive, committed larceny, but because the taking was not done by force or threat of force, he did not commit robbery.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. The purpose of the taking in this case is irrelevant to the charge of larceny; the defendant need not take the property for his own use to be guilty of larceny. Answer B is incorrect because the fact that the victim is dead is not a defense to the charge of larceny. The property taken was not the defendant's to take; it belonged to another, the estate of the victim. Answer D is incorrect because the property taken need not have a specific monetary value. The fact that it is the personal property of another is sufficient.","Other Crimes"
"A man suffered from the delusion that he was a special agent of God. He frequently experienced hallucinations in the form of hearing divine commands. The man believed God told him several times that the local Roman Catholic bishop was corrupting the diocese into heresy, and that the bishop should be ""done away with."" The man, a devout Catholic, conceived of himself as a religious martyr. He knew that shooting bishops for heresy is against the criminal law. He nevertheless carefully planned how he might kill the bishop. One evening the man shot the bishop, who was taken to the hospital where he died two weeks later.<br /><br />The man told the police he assumed the institutions of society would support the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and he expected to be persecuted for his God-inspired actions. A psychiatrist examined the man and found that the man suffered from schizophrenic psychosis, that in the absence of this psychosis he would not have shot the bishop, and that because of the psychosis the man found it extremely difficult to determine whether he should obey the specific command that he do away with the bishop or the general commandment ""Thou shalt not kill.""

The M'Naughten rule is the test that should be applied to determine if a defendant will be held criminally responsible for his actions, or if he was insane at the time of the commission of the offense. The test is whether at the time of committing the act, the accused was laboring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. With this fact situation, the man was operating under a mental defect that made him believe the actions he took were, in fact, the right thing to do.<br /><br />Answers A and C are incorrect because the man understood the nature and quality of his actions. He had the intent to kill the bishop, he carefully planned the killing, and he knew the actions he took would result in the death of the bishop. The quality and nature of his actions were intended to, and did, kill the bishop. Answer D is a statement of the product test, a different test for insanity, and not the applicable M'Naughten test. Answer D is incorrect.<br /><br />Although he understood the nature and quality of his actions, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.

The defendant in Answer B is charged with assault, which is the attempt to commit a criminal battery. The defendant's mistake as to the identity of the person grabbing him would negate his intent to commit a criminal unlawful touching of another. The defendant could not be said to have had the intent to commit a battery, because he did not believe that his use of force was unlawful; he believed it was in self-defense.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because illegal sale of alcohol is a strict liability offense so the defendant's mistake does not negate the mental state necessary for the offense.

The statutory definition of burglary requires that the man break and enter the building with the intent to commit a felony or steal therein.

The man had cased the store, planned to hold up the store, got a toy gun, and entered the store, all while having the requisite intent to steal from the owner. Any subsequent intent to leave will not be a valid defense to his entry with the intent to steal. Answer C is incorrect; although he quickly changed his mind, the man had the intent to commit a theft when he entered the store. A change in his mind after he entered with the necessary intent would not be a valid defense to the burglary charge. One cannot withdraw from a crime after he has committed it.

Robbery is the taking, by force or threat of force, the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property.

To be convicted of attempted robbery, a person must have the intent to commit a robbery and take a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. The man did, by threatening the clerk and going behind the counter, take substantial steps toward the commission of the offense of robbery, and did have the intent to commit the robbery, so he should be convicted of attempted robbery.<br /><br />A is incorrect.

The fact that the man changed his mind about the crimes after he had completed them does not negate either charge. Answer B is incorrect because when the man committed the larceny, the charge of attempted larceny merged into the larceny charge. Answer C is incorrect because the man committed a larceny when he took the silverware with the intent to permanently deprive the neighbor of possession.

"During an altercation between a boss and her employee at a company picnic, the boss suffered a knife wound in her abdomen and the employee was charged with assault and attempted murder.

At common law, voluntary intoxication can be the basis for a defense to a specific intent crime if the intoxication negated the requisite mens rea of the offense. In this case, the employee is charged with assault and attempted murder, both of which are specific intent crimes. Assault requires the intent to commit a battery or the intent to create a reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm. Attempted murder requires proof that the employee had the intent to kill his boss and took substantial steps toward the commission of the offense. If the employee was unable to form the intent to commit a battery or the intent to commit a murder due to his intoxication, he would have a valid defense to the charge. The evidence of the employee's intoxication should be admitted without limitation.<br /><br />Answer B can also be correct because the assault was actually brought to fruition by the commission of the battery. By stabbing his boss, the employee did not merely commit an assault; he committed criminal battery. The charge of assault would thus merge into the battery offense, and the evidence of the intoxication should be admitted only to the attempted murder charge.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because the evidence of intoxication may negate the employee's intent to commit the murder and should be admitted for that purpose. Answer D is incorrect for the same reason. Because the evidence of the intoxication could negate the mental state requirement of the assault charge and the attempted murder, it should be admitted as to both. However, it is also possible that the assault charge merged into a battery, and the evidence of the intoxication should only be admissible to the attempted murder charge.

A simple promise to pay, even if the debt is not paid, is insufficient evidence to prove the intent to permanently deprive. In addition, a simple promise to pay is insufficient to be considered a false or misleading statement.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because there was no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation, and no evidence of the man's intent never to pay back the loan. At common law, larceny by trick is the obtaining of possession, with the owner's consent, of the property of another by fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. At common law, false pretenses is obtaining the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Both larceny by trick and false pretenses require proof of intent to permanently deprive and the making of false or fraudulent statements. A promise to pay, even if never met, is insufficient for a finding of either. Answers B and C are also incorrect for the same reason. This case is a simple unpaid loan, which, at common law, is insufficient evidence for proof of fraud or misrepresentation or of proof of intent to permanently deprive.","Other Crimes"
"A father, disappointed by his 8-year-old son's failure to do well in school, began systematically depriving the child of food during summer vacation. Although his son became seriously ill from malnutrition, the father failed to call a doctor. He believed that as a parent he had the sole right to determine whether the child was fed or received medical treatment. Eventually the child died. An autopsy disclosed that the child had suffered agonizingly as a result of the starvation, that a physician's aid would have alleviated the suffering, and that although the child would have died in a few months from malnutrition, the actual cause of death was an untreatable form of cancer.<br /><br />The father was prosecuted for murder, defined in the jurisdiction as an ""unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought."" The father should be",multiple-choice,"acquitted, because of the defendant's good faith belief concerning parental rights in supervising children.","acquitted, because summoning the physician or feeding the child would not have prevented the child's death from cancer.","convicted, because the father's treatment of his son showed reckless indifference to the value of life.","convicted, because the child would have died from malnutrition had he not been afflicted with cancer.",2,"B is correct. The father should be acquitted of murder because, simply put, he did not cause the death of the child. His actions, as reprehensible as they may be, were not an actual, nor a proximate cause of his child's death. His child died of cancer, and, even if the child had been taken to the physician and fed properly, the defendant cannot be criminally liable for the child's death.<br /><br />A is incorrect. The father's belief concerning his parental rights, whether done in good faith or not, will not serve as a defense to a charge of murder. If the father's actions rose to the standard of gross recklessness necessary for implied malice aforethought, his belief concerning his parental rights is not a defense. This answer choice ignores the actual and proximate cause of the child's death.<br /><br />C is incorrect. While the father's treatment of his son did show reckless indifference to the value of human life, it did not cause the child's death. It certainly caused severe pain and suffering, and the father may be prosecuted for that, but the fact remains that the child died from an untreatable form of cancer, not as a result of the father's actions.<br /><br />D is incorrect. The fact that the child would have died eventually from the malnutrition will not allow for a conviction of murder when the cause of death was unrelated to the malnutrition. Because there is no evidence that the father's actions caused the death, aided in the cancer, or even shortened the life, of the child, he cannot be convicted of murder.",Homicide
"Two bullies hated a bartender and agreed to start a fight with the bartender and, if the opportunity arose, to kill him.<br /><br />The two bullies met the bartender in the street outside a bar and began to push him around. Three men who also hated the bartender stopped to watch. One of the men threw one of the bullies a knife. A second man told the bully, ""Kill him."" The third man, who made no move and said nothing, hoped that the bully would kill the bartender with the knife. One bully held the bartender while the other bully stabbed and killed him.<br /><br />On a charge of murdering the bartender, the third man who made no move and said nothing is",multiple-choice,"not guilty, because mere presence, coupled with silent approval and intent, is not sufficient.","not guilty, because he did not tell the bully ahead of time that he hoped the bully would murder the bartender.","guilty, because he had a duty to stop the killing and made no attempt to do so.","guilty, because he was present and approved of what occurred.",1,"The correct answer is A. Mere presence, even if accompanied by silent approval and intent, is insufficient actus reus to make a person criminally responsible for the actions of another. The man's mere presence, even if he had the requisite intent, will not make him accountable, and he should be found not guilty. Answer A is correct.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because there is no affirmative duty to save the life of another, except in rare, usually familial, relationships; mere failure to stop a murder does not make one accountable for the actions of the murderer. Answer D is incorrect; mere presence and approval lack the sufficient actus reus requirement for criminal liability for the actions of another. There must be some verbal encouragement made or aid given. Answer B is incorrect; while informing the actor beforehand that you approve of his actions may, in some rare circumstances, be sufficient to act as ""encouragement,"" it is not the only way for the man to be found accountable for the bully's actions.","Inchoate Crimes"

He returns the car the next day. The defendant is charged with obtaining property by false pretenses.","With permission, the defendant, promising to return it by 9:00 p.m., borrows the owner's car. Later in the evening, the defendant decides to keep the car until the next morning and does so. The defendant is charged with embezzlement.",2,"Answer B is correct. At common law, larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent, and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Larceny by trick is obtaining possession, with the owner's consent, of the property of another by fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. False pretenses is obtaining the title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation. Embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of another person's property by someone who held the property pursuant to a trust agreement.<br /><br />In answer A, the defendant took possession of the property of another without the owner's consent but lacked the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Because he was planning to return the vehicle at the time of the taking, he is not guilty of larceny. Therefore, answer A is incorrect.<br /><br />In answer B, the defendant obtained possession of the property by falsely promising to return it. When the defendant took, he had the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. His subsequent return of the car does not negate this intent, thus, the defendant is guilty of larceny by trick. Therefore, answer B is correct.<br /><br />In answer C, the defendant obtained possession of, but not title to, the property. If only possession is obtained, the proper charge is larceny by trick. Therefore, answer C is incorrect.<br /><br />In answer D, the defendant obtained possession of the property pursuant to a trust agreement, but never converted the property. Instead, the defendant merely kept the property for an extra few hours. Therefore, answer D is incorrect.","Other Crimes"
"Unprepared for a final examination, a student asked his girlfriend to set off the fire alarms in the university building 15 minutes after the test commenced. The girlfriend did so. Several students were injured in the panic that followed as people were trying to get out of the building. The student and the girlfriend are prosecuted for battery and for conspiracy to commit battery.<br /><br />They are",multiple-choice,"guilty of both crimes.","guilty of battery but not guilty of conspiracy.","not guilty of battery but guilty of conspiracy.","not guilty of either crime.",2,"Both B and D are correct answers. At common law, battery is a general intent crime and is defined as the unlawful offensive touching of another. The girlfriend and the student, as accomplices, by pulling the fire alarm, caused many of the students to be offensively touched to the point of injury. These unlawful touchings were completely foreseeable from the pulling of the fire alarm, and they were the direct result of the student and his girlfriend's intentional act. Because battery is a general intent crime, the student and his girlfriend are guilty of battery.<br /><br />Conspiracy to commit battery, on the other hand, is a specific intent crime and requires an agreement to commit the crime of battery. For a proper conspiracy charge, both parties must reach an agreement and intend that the crime of battery be committed. Because conspiracy is a specific intent crime, there must be proof that both the student and his girlfriend specifically intended for people to be the victims of criminal battery. In this case, although the batteries were a foreseeable consequence of their actions, the student and his girlfriend did not have the specific intent that the batteries occur. Instead, they intended that the student get out of a final exam. The student and his girlfriend should be found not guilty of the offense of conspiracy to commit battery. Therefore answer B is correct.<br /><br />Answer D is also correct. When this question appeared on the bar exam, so many students chose answer D, that credit was given for both answers. If the student and his girlfriend are found to have lacked the general intent necessary to commit the crime of battery, then they would be found not guilty of either crime. In this case, it is possible that the girlfriend, and the student as her accomplice, meant to pull the fire alarms, but there is no indication that they intended to cause unlawful offensive touchings.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the student and his girlfriend did not have the specific intent to cause criminal battery, and, lacking that specific intent, cannot be found guilty of conspiracy. Answer C is incorrect for that same reason, and also because battery is a general intent crime.","Other Crimes"
"A bank teller was fired by the president of a bank. The teller wanted to take revenge against the president, but decided against attempting it personally, because he knew the president was protected around the clock by bank security guards. The teller knew a man who had a violent temper and was very jealous. The teller falsely told the man that the man's wife was having an affair with the bank president. Enraged, the man said, ""What am I going to do?"" The teller said, ""If it were my wife, I'd just march into his office and blow his brains out."" The man grabbed a revolver and rushed to the bank. He walked into the bank, carrying the gun in his hand. One of the security guards, believing a holdup was about to occur, shot and killed the man.<br /><br />If charged with murder of the man, the teller should be found",multiple-choice,"guilty, based upon extreme recklessness.","guilty, based upon transferred intent.","not guilty, because he did not intend for the man to be shot by the security guard.","not guilty, because he did not shoot the man, and he was not acting in concert with the security guard.",1,"The correct answer is A. Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Malice does not require the intent to kill; in some cases, there may be ""implied malice"" if there was gross or extreme recklessness to human life on the part of the defendant. In the question, the teller, knowing the man to be violent and jealous, lied to him, and suggested he commit murder. By taking actions that ensured the man would be walking into a heavily guarded bank with a gun, the teller acted with extreme recklessness; this is enough to show implied malice aforethought. Therefore, the teller should be found guilty of murder. An additional facet of the question raises the issue of whether the teller was a ""proximate cause"" of the man's death. The general test is whether the death was foreseeable; a defendant will be held criminally liable for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. In this case, by ensuring the man would enter a heavily guarded bank with the intent to kill the president and armed with a gun, it was foreseeable that the man would be killed.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because transferred intent does not apply in cases where the actor doing the killing is different than the one who has the intent to kill the president. The teller's intent to kill the president will not transfer to the security guard's' action of killing the man. Answer C is incorrect because the ""implied malice"" doctrine does not require that the teller have the intent that the man be killed; it is sufficient that the death of the man was a foreseeable result of the actions the teller put into motion, and that those actions were taken with extreme recklessness. Answer D is incorrect because the charge does not require that the teller be the one to shoot the man or that he act in concert with the security guard. Because the teller proximately caused the death of the man and did so with malice aforethought, the teller should be found guilty of murder.",Homicide
"The defendant, an avid fan of his home town football team, shot at the leg of a star player for a rival team, intending to injure the player's leg enough to hospitalize him for a few weeks, but not to kill him. The player died of loss of blood.<br /><br />What is the most serious offense of which the defendant could be properly convicted?",multiple-choice,"Involuntary manslaughter.","Voluntary manslaughter.",Murder.,"Felony murder.",3,"The correct answer is C. Murder is defined at common law as the unlawful killing of another with malice aforethought. The malice aforethought requirement can be satisfied by an intent to kill, an intent to inflict great bodily harm, reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, or intent to commit certain dangerous felonies. In this question, the defendant acted with the intent to commit great bodily harm, shown by his intent to hospitalize the player for a few weeks. Since the killing was done with malice aforethought, the most serious offense that the defendant can be properly convicted of is murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. Voluntary manslaughter is a killing that would otherwise be murder but is distinguishable from murder by the existence of adequate provocation. This is often described as a killing in the heat of passion. Here, there was no legally adequate provocation, and the shooting was not done in the sudden heat of passion. Therefore, there is no defense that would mitigate the killing to voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. Involuntary manslaughter refers to an unintentional killing that results from recklessness or criminal negligence. Here, the defendant intended to shoot the player. Although he did not intend for the player to die, he did intend to cause great bodily harm. The killing was not done pursuant to a lawful act recklessly done, nor does the misdemeanor manslaughter rule apply. Therefore involuntary manslaughter does not apply.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. Under felony murder, a killing that occurs in the course of a dangerous felony, even an accidental one, may be charged as first-degree murder. The specific intent required, must be the intent to commit the underlying felony. The felony murder rule can be applied only if the underlying felony is independent of the killing. Thus, felonies such as manslaughter or aggravated battery are not qualifying underlying felonies because they are not a separate offenses. They are included in the same act. Felony murder statutes usually include a list of enumerated felonies which qualify as the base offense. The most common enumerated felonies are arson, rape, burglary, robbery, and kidnapping. Here, the defendant begun by commit an aggravated battery, which turned into a homicide. There is no felony independent of the killing for which felony murder could be charged.",Homicide
"A homeowner met a man, who was known to him to be a burglar, in a bar. The homeowner told the man that he needed money. He promised to pay the man $500 if the man would go to the homeowner's house the following night and take some silverware. The homeowner explained to the man that, although the silverware was legally his, his wife would object to his selling it.<br /><br />The homeowner pointed out his home, one of a group of similar tract houses. He drew a floor plan of the house that showed the location of the silverware. The homeowner said that his wife usually took several sleeping pills before retiring, and that he would make sure that she took them the next night. He promised to leave a window unlocked.<br /><br />Everything went according to the plan except that the man, deceived by the similarity of the tract houses, went to the wrong house. He found a window unlocked, climbed in and found silver where the homeowner had indicated. He took the silver to the cocktail lounge where the payoff was to take place.

Burglary is defined at common law as the breaking and entering of a dwelling of another with the intent to commit a felony therein. Neither the homeowner nor the man had the intent to commit a felony, which should lead to an acquittal for the homeowner. The man's mistake regarding which house belonged to the homeowner negates the intent required for burglary. Therefore, this is also the homeowner's best argument for acquittal.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect; since the house was not open to the public, the man's opening of the window was a ""breaking."" Answer B is incorrect because the homeowner could not give consent for the man to enter his neighbor's house, and the owner of the house did not consent to the entry. Answer C is incorrect because requesting that the man commit these acts, providing the floor plan of the house, and providing additional information were all overt acts that the homeowner had taken. The homeowner aided and abetted the man in his actions, and he would thus be criminally liable for the man's actions.","Other Crimes"
"Two brothers operated an illicit distillery. They customarily sold to anyone unless they suspected the person of being a revenue agent or an informant. One day when one of the brothers was at the distillery alone, he was approached by a buyer who asked to buy a gallon of liquor. The buyer was in fact a revenue officer. After the brother had sold him the liquor, the buyer revealed his identity. The brother grabbed one of the rifles that the brothers kept handy in case of trouble with the law, and shot and wounded the buyer. Other officers, hiding nearby, overpowered and arrested the brother who had shot the buyer.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, the second brother came on the scene. The officers in hiding had been waiting for him. One of them approached him and asked to buy liquor. The second brother was suspicious and refused to sell.

Conspirators are liable for all foreseeable crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. The brothers conspired to operate a distillery, and the battery of a revenue officer was a foreseeable act in furtherance of the conspiracy. The fact that the brothers kept rifles handy in case of trouble with the law shows that the possibility of battery was foreseeable, and therefore the second brother will bear criminal responsibility for the battery. The second brother is criminally responsible for the actions of his brother in committing the battery. Both are guilty.<br /><br />A is incorrect; the brother who shot the buyer intentionally caused an unlawful offensive touching of the buyer so he is clearly guilty. Answer C is incorrect; the arrest of the brother who shot the buyer was made after he shot the buyer, and it would not serve to terminate the conspiracy or negate the second brother's responsibility for foreseeable crimes committed in the furtherance of the conspiracy. Answer D is incorrect; the battery that the brother who shot the buyer committed was foreseeable; this is evidenced by the fact that the brothers kept the rifles handy in case of trouble with the law. It was also done in the furtherance of the conspiracy to continue to sell illegal liquor. Since the battery was foreseeable, it was not outside the scope of the conspiracy, and the second brother is guilty of the battery.","Inchoate Crimes"

In this jurisdiction, the use of poison or acting with premeditation may elevate murder from second to first degree. However, murder requires that a killer have acted with malice aforethought, express or implied. Malice exists when a person intends to kill, intends to inflict great bodily harm, intends to commit an inherently dangerous felony, or acts with a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. The employee here did not intend to kill or cause serious injury to her boss when the employee dropped laxatives into her boss's coffee; the facts state that the employee only intended to cause her boss discomfort. Moreover, giving her boss laxatives that could be purchased over the counter does not rise to the level of reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life. Therefore, because the employee did not intend to kill, did not intend to cause serious bodily injury, did not act with reckless indifference, and was not in the course of committing a felony, she would not be guilty of any degree of murder.

The bar patron's best argument for acquittal is that, because the accident would have occurred even if the bar patron had not been intoxicated, his reckless action giving rise to the manslaughter charge was not a cause in fact ('but for' cause) of the other driver's death. Because the action that the bar patron took was not a cause in fact, he cannot be convicted of manslaughter.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because contributory negligence is a civil issue and does not apply to criminal manslaughter cases. Answer C is incorrect because voluntary intoxication is only a defense to specific intent crimes, not to crimes involving criminal negligence, such as manslaughter.

At common law, forgery is the false making or material alteration of a writing where the writing has the apparent ability to defraud and is of apparent legal efficacy with the intent to defraud. The calligrapher did not commit forgery, because the document, by itself, has no legal efficacy or significance, it was merely purporting to be a letter. However, the calligrapher did commit false pretense because she obtained the property and title to property, the $5,000, by fraud and misrepresentation, and she had the intent to permanently deprive the owner of that property. Even though she did not specifically promise anything about the letter's authenticity, the calligrapher misrepresented the nature of the letter by saying it was from a collector rather than created by herself; she misrepresented who owned the letter, and how she obtained the letter. Those misrepresentations induced the buyer into giving her the money.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the letter, by itself, had no legal significance, so the calligrapher did not commit forgery.

As explained above, the movement in the neighboring state was more than incidental to the robbery and would constitute kidnapping there as well as in the driver's home state.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect.

"The owner of an old warehouse decided to destroy the warehouse because the taxes on the structure exceeded the income that he could receive from it. He crept into the building in the middle of the night with a can of gasoline and a fuse and set the fuse timer for 30 minutes. He then left the building. The fuse failed to ignite and the building was not harmed.<br /><br />Arson is defined in this jurisdiction as ""the intentional burning of any building or structure of another, without the consent of the owner."" The warehouse owner believed, however, that burning one's own building was arson, having been so advised by his lawyer.<br /><br />Has the warehouse owner committed attempted arson?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because factual impossibility is no defense.","Yes, because a mistake of law, even on the advice of an attorney, is no defense.","No, because his mistake negated a necessary mental state.","No, because even if his actions had every consequence he intended, they would not have constituted arson.",4,"The correct answer is D. Because the warehouse owner, even if everything went as he had intended, could not have committed the crime of arson, he cannot be convicted of committing attempted arson. Arson requires that the building being burned be owned by ""another"" and that it be burned without the consent of the owner. Because he owned the building and consented to the burning, it was legally impossible for him to commit the crime of arson. Legal impossibility is a defense to an attempt charge, so the owner did not commit attempted arson.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because, although factual impossibility is not a defense, the owner also had a legal impossibility claim that served as a defense to the attempt charge. Answer B is incorrect because mistake of law can be a defense, and it confuses the mistake of law defense to a criminal charge with the legal impossibility defense to an attempt charge. It was impossible for the owner to commit the crime of arson, regardless of whether the owner made the mistake of believing it was. This kind of legal impossibility is a defense to a charge of attempted arson. Answer C is incorrect because the owner's ""mistake"" did not negate a necessary mens rea. The owner did have the requisite mental state for arson, which is intentionally burning a building. However, he could not be convicted of attempted arson, because the building he intended to burn was his own.","General Principles"
"A man, his brother, and his cousin are charged in a common law jurisdiction with conspiracy to commit larceny. The state introduced evidence that they agreed to go to a neighbor's house to take stock certificates from a safe in the neighbor's bedroom, that they went to the house, and that they were arrested as they entered the neighbor's bedroom.<br /><br />The man testified that he thought the stock certificates belonged to the cousin, that the neighbor was improperly keeping them from the cousin, and that he went along to aid in retrieving the cousin's property.<br /><br />The brother testified that he suspected the man and the cousin of being thieves and joined up with them in order to catch them. He also testified that he made an anonymous telephone call to the police alerting them to the crime and that the call caused the police to be waiting for them when they walked into the neighbor's bedroom.<br /><br />The cousin did not testify.<br /><br />If the jury believes the man, it should find him",multiple-choice,"guilty, because there was an agreement, and the entry into the bedroom is sufficient for the overt act.","guilty, because good motives are not a defense to criminal liability.","not guilty, because he did not have a corrupt motive.","not guilty, because he did not intend to steal.",4,"The correct answer is D. A charge of conspiracy requires that there exist an agreement that a crime be committed and that the co-conspirators intend that the crime be committed. If a defendant does not have the intent to commit a crime, he should be found not guilty of conspiracy to commit that offense. In this case, the jury believes that the man thought the property was rightfully the cousin's. Therefore, the man did not have the intent to commit larceny, and should be found not guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because it ignores the requisite mental state for a conspiracy charge. Conspiracy to commit larceny requires not only that there exist an agreement and an overt act, but also that the defendant have the requisite mental state for the commission of the underlying crime. Answer B is incorrect because the man's belief that he was acting legally to retrieve the cousin's property will preclude a conviction due to a lack of criminal intent. Answer C is incorrect because conspiracy requires proof of intent to commit a crime, and does not require proof of a corrupt motive. A corrupt motive does not always prove criminal intent, and criminal intent can still be present in the absence of a corrupt motive.","Inchoate Crimes"
"A defendant was tried for robbery. The victim and a bystander were the only witnesses called to testify. The victim testified that the defendant threatened her with a knife, grabbed her purse, and ran off with it. The bystander testified that he saw the defendant grab the victim's purse and run away with it but that he neither saw a knife nor heard any threats. On this evidence the jury could properly return a verdict of guilty of",multiple-choice,"robbery only.","larceny only.","either robbery or larceny.","both robbery and larceny.",3,"The correct answer is C. The jury, as fact-finder, can find that the victim was correct and credible and that the defendant took her property by threat of force. The jury could then find the defendant guilty of robbery. The jury could also find that the bystander was correct and credible and find that the defendant took the property without force, and find the defendant guilty of larceny. However, in this question, larceny is a lesser included offense of robbery and will be merged into the higher charge if the jury finds the robbery was committed. So the jury can find the defendant guilty of larceny only or guilty of robbery only, but under the merger doctrine, cannot find him guilty of both. Answer C is correct.<br /><br />Answers A and B are incorrect; the jury is the finder of fact in the case, and there is sufficient evidence presented for them to make a finding of guilt as to either robbery or larceny.

"Statutes in a jurisdiction define criminal assault as ""an attempt to commit a criminal battery"" and criminal battery as ""causing an offensive touching.""<br /><br />As a man was walking down the street, a gust of wind blew his hat off. The man reached out, trying to grab his hat, and narrowly missed striking a woman in the face with his hand. The woman, fearful of being struck by the man, pushed the man away.<br /><br />If charged with criminal assault, the man should be found",multiple-choice,"guilty, because he caused the woman to be in apprehension of an offensive touching.","guilty, because he should have realized he might strike someone by reaching out.","not guilty, because he did not intend to hit the woman.","not guilty, because he did not hit the woman.",3,"The correct answer is C. Assault is the attempt to commit a criminal battery. To attempt to commit a crime, one must have the intent that the crime be committed and take a substantial step towards its commission. The man had no intent to commit a criminal battery; he was attempting to grab his hat.<br /><br />The mens rea requirement of assault requires the intent to commit a battery. Answer A is incorrect because it ignores the mens rea requirement of an assault charge. Answer B is incorrect because it misstates the mens rea requirement. The possibility of striking someone is not the same as the intent to strike someone. The charge of assault does not require actual contact occur, just the attempt to commit battery. Answer D is incorrect. Under these facts, the man did not ever have to actually hit the woman; he just needed to intend to hit her.","Inchoate Crimes"
"Which of the following is most likely to be found to be a strict liability offense?",multiple-choice,"A city ordinance providing for a fine of not more than $200 for shoplifting.","A federal statute making it a felony to possess heroin.","A state statute making it a felony to fail to register a firearm.","A state statute making the sale of adulterated milk a misdemeanor.",4,"D is the correct answer and can be reached through the process of elimination. A strict liability crime is a light-penalty public welfare offense, which does not require that the actor have mens rea; rather, the actor need only perform the action prohibited by statute. Although for public policy concerns we impose punishment without mens rea, the punishment is usually lighter than that for a crime where intent, recklessness, or knowledge has been proved.<br /><br />Answers B and C can be eliminated immediately as they are both felony crimes, which are subject to more severe penalties. Answer A is not the best answer because it is not a public welfare offense, but an ordinance against theft. This leaves choice D as the best answer. The sale of adulterated milk is clearly a matter of public welfare and as such could be subject to a strict liability statute. A, B, and C are incorrect.","General Principles"

The defendant locked the woman in the bathroom while he accepted the jewelry from the maid when she arrived.","The defendant unbuttoned the vest of a man too drunk to notice and removed his wallet. A minute later, the victim missed his wallet and accused the defendant of taking it. The defendant pretended to be insulted, slapped the victim, and went off with the wallet.",4,"The correct answer is D. Robbery is defined at common law as the taking, by force or threat of force, of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. There must be a nexus between the use or threat of force, and the taking. The defendant's unbuttoning of his victims vest is insufficient to be considered the taking by force, and his later slap did not coincide with the taking, but rather was done to aid in his pretending to be insulted. Of the answer choices, choice D has the most tenuous connection between the force or threat of force and the taking of the property.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because here the defendant used force by binding his victim and compelling her to tell him the whereabouts of the jewelry, and he then took her property. Answer B is incorrect because here the defendant took the property of another, with the intent to deprive the owner of the property, by the use of force. Since the other man who used the force was his confederate, the defendant is responsible for both the taking and the use of force. Answer C is incorrect because here the defendant's forcing the woman to have the jewelry brought to him, accompanied by his locking her in the bathroom, were force and the threat of force. This use of force and threat of force were necessary to help him with the taking of her jewelry.","Other Crimes"
"A clerk lived on the second floor of a small convenience store/gas station that he owned. One night he refused to sell the defendant a six-pack of beer after hours, saying he could not violate the state laws. The defendant became enraged and deliberately drove his car into one of the gasoline pumps, severing it from its base. There was an ensuing explosion causing a ball of fire to go from the underground gasoline tank into the building. As a result, the building burned to the ground and the clerk was killed.<br /><br />In a common-law jurisdiction, if the defendant is charged with murder and arson, he should be",multiple-choice,"convicted of both offenses.","convicted of involuntary manslaughter and acquitted of arson.","convicted of arson and involuntary manslaughter.","acquitted of both offenses.",1,"The correct answer is A. At common law, murder is defined as the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice can be shown by having an intent to kill, or by having an intent to inflict great bodily harm. Malice can also be implied in actions that demonstrate gross recklessness toward human life. In addition, felony murder is the killing of someone during the commission of a violent felony. Arson is defined at common law as the malicious burning of the dwelling of another.<br /><br />In this case, the defendant maliciously burned the clerk's dwelling and, during the commission of that arson, caused the clerk's death. Additionally, the defendant acted with malice aforethought when he caused the clerk's death. Deliberately driving a car into a gasoline pump demonstrates a reckless indifference to a high risk to human life; this is sufficient for a finding of malice aforethought for the murder charge. The defendant could be convicted of either murder with malice aforethought or felony murder with arson as the underlying felony. In addition, the defendant's driving his vehicle into a gasoline pump also had the foreseeable consequences of igniting the gasoline, creating a ball of fire, and burning the building the clerk was in. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of both arson and murder.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because the defendant's actions were not merely negligent, which would support only an involuntary manslaughter charge; they were done with the type of reckless disregard for human life that would qualify the clerk's homicide as murder committed with malice aforethought. In addition, answer B is incorrect because the defendant could be convicted of felony murder. Additionally, because the defendant maliciously burned the clerk's dwelling, he should also be convicted of arson. The charge of arson does not require an intentional setting of a fire. It is sufficient for the burning to be foreseeable from a defendant's action, such as deliberately driving a vehicle into gasoline pumps. Answer C is incorrect because the defendant committed murder, not involuntary manslaughter. Answer D is incorrect because the defendant committed both offenses.",Homicide
"The plaintiff took a diamond ring to a pawnshop and borrowed $20 on it. It was agreed that the loan was to be repaid within 60 days and if it was not, the pawnshop owner, the defendant, could sell the ring. A week before expiration of the 60 days, the defendant had an opportunity to sell the ring to a customer for $125. He did so, thinking it unlikely that the plaintiff would repay the loan and if he did, the defendant would be able to handle him somehow, even by paying him for the ring if necessary. Two days later, the plaintiff came in with the money to reclaim his ring. The defendant told him that it had been stolen when his shop was burglarized one night and that therefore he was not responsible for its loss.<br /><br />Larceny, embezzlement, false pretenses, and robbery are separate crimes in the jurisdiction.<br /><br />Suppose that instead of denying liability, the defendant told the plaintiff the truth--that he sold the ring because he thought the plaintiff would not reclaim it--and offered to give the plaintiff $125. The plaintiff demanded his ring. The defendant said, ""Look buddy, that's what I got for it and it's more than it's worth."" The plaintiff reluctantly took the money. What offense could the defendant most appropriately be found guilty of?",multiple-choice,Larceny.,Embezzlement.,"False Pretenses.",Robbery.,2,"B is correct. At common law, embezzlement is the fraudulent conversion of another person's property by someone who had lawful possession of said property. The fact that the defendant, after his illegal action, offered to make restitution for the ring does not excuse his guilt, nor change the offense under which he should be found guilty. The defendant still had a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff, he still had lawful possession of the ring, and he still unlawfully converted the ring. He is guilty of embezzlement. A later attempt to make restitution does not change the offense.<br /><br />A is incorrect. At common law, larceny is the taking possession and carrying away of the personal property of another, without the owner's consent, and with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of said property. Here, the defendant had permission to possess the ring from its rightful owner. Therefore, he would not be found guilty of larceny.<br /><br />C is incorrect. At common law, false pretense is obtaining the possession and title of property of another through fraud or misrepresentation, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Here, the defendant did not obtain possession of the ring through fraud or misrepresentation. He obtained possession lawfully. Therefore, he would not be found guilty of false pretenses.<br /><br />D is incorrect. Robbery consists of: (i) a taking; (ii) of personal property of another; (iii) from the other's person or presence; (iv) by force or intimidation; (v) with the intent to permanently deprive him of it. Here, the defendant was given the ring by the plaintiff. The elements of robbery are not met, therefore, he would not be found guilty of robbery.","Other Crimes"
"A college student and his friend were watching a football game at the student's home when they began to argue. The friend became abusive, and the student asked him to leave. The friend refused, walked into the kitchen, picked up a knife, and said he would cut the student's heart out. The student pulled a gun from under the sofa, walked to his front door, opened it, and again told the friend to leave. The friend again refused. Instead, he walked slowly toward the student, brandishing the knife in a threatening manner. The student, rather than running out the door himself, shot in the friend's direction, intending only to scare him.

The college student, when he shot his friend, was acting in self-defense and should be acquitted of murder. A claim of self-defense will be successful against a murder charge if the action resulting in the death is reasonably necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself from the use of unlawful force. In this case, the friend had verbally threatened to kill the student, and was walking toward the student, brandishing the knife in a threatening manner. The student believed shooting the gun was necessary to protect himself from the friend's unlawful use of force, and that belief was, in light of all the circumstances, reasonable.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because the friend had threatened to cut the student's heart out, was coming directly at the student, and was brandishing a deadly weapon, the knife, in a threatening manner. The student's firing of the gun to protect himself was not unreasonable. Answer B is incorrect because the student was in his own house and had asked the friend to leave twice. The student was under no obligation to retreat from his own house before using force to protect himself. Answer C is incorrect because it ignores the student's self-defense claim and because it is possible to be convicted of murder with malice aforethought without having the intent to kill the victim. The student, in his own house and having no duty to retreat, killed the friend in self-defense, and should be acquitted of murder.","General Principles"
"Nine gang members, including the gang leader, were indicted for the murder of a tenth gang member, who had become an informant. The gang leader pleaded guilty.

The gang leader had learned that the released gang member had earned his freedom by informing the authorities about the gang's criminal activities. The gang leader decided to use the party to let the other gang members see what happened to informants. He told no one about his plan. At the party, after everyone had consumed large amounts of liquor, the gang leader announced that the released gang member was an informant and stabbed him with a knife in front of the others.

The jury found the eight gang members guilty of murder, and they appealed. <br /><br />Should the appellate court uphold the convictions?",multiple-choice,"No, because mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to make a person an accomplice.","No, because murder is a specific-intent crime, and there is insufficient evidence to show that the other gang members intended to kill.","Yes, because the gang members made no effort to save the released gang member after he had been stabbed.","Yes, because voluntary intoxication does not negate criminal responsibility.",1,"Answer A is correct. Murder is the intentional killing of another human being with malice aforethought. The eight gang members are not guilty of murder because they took no affirmative act and were merely present at what turned out to be a crime scene. <br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the convictions should not be upheld, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. Murder does not require specific intent to kill, but may be committed in other circumstances (e.g., intent-to-do-serious-bodily-harm murder, depraved-heart murder, and felony murder). In this case, the eight gang members are not guilty of murder because they took no affirmative steps and were merely present at what turned out to be a crime scene. <br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. The eight gang members did not have a legal duty, enforceable by the criminal laws, to save the informant. Moreover, they are not responsible for the murder because they took no affirmative steps and were merely present at what turned out to be a crime scene. <br /><br />Answer D is incorrect.

In this case, the defendant is using a mistake of fact defense. She incorrectly believed that the gun was a prop, not a real gun, and that it would fire blanks, not real bullets. Mistake of fact may be a defense only if it negates the state of mind required for the crime. In this case, the mistake of fact would negate the intent needed for both murder and manslaughter. However, with a mistake of fact defense, there is also one more consideration. For malice and general intent crimes, there is an extra requirement that the mistake of fact be reasonable (i.e., the type of mistake that a reasonable person would have made under the circumstances). In contrast, specific intent crimes do not require the added reasonableness requirement. Any mistake of fact, reasonable or unreasonable is a defense to a specific intent crime. In this case, murder and manslaughter are general intent crimes. Therefore, if the jury believes that the mistake of fact made by the defendant is reasonable, it is a valid defense to both crimes.

The charge of conspiracy requires that two parties intentionally enter an agreement to commit a crime with the intent to achieve the objective of the agreement.

Therefore, he should be found not guilty of conspiracy to commit larceny.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because it ignores the requisite intent for a conspiracy charge. Conspiracy to commit larceny requires that each co-conspirator enter the agreement with the intent to achieve the object of the agreement.

The defendant, on the other hand, had the intent to sell cocaine, and took substantial steps toward the commission of that offense. The fact that it was factually impossible for her to commit the crime of selling cocaine is not a valid defense to the attempt charge.

"A state statute provides: ""Aggravated robbery of the elderly consists of robbery committed against a victim who is 65 years of age or older."" Another state statute provides that when a criminal statute does not designate a necessary mental state, the mental state required is recklessness. A third state statute provides that a person acts recklessly if the person ""consciously disregards a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element exists or will result from the person's conduct."" <br /><br />The evidence at a criminal trial showed that the defendant robbed a 66-year-old man outside a senior citizens' center. The defendant testified truthfully that the robbery had occurred on a dark night, that she had had no idea how old the victim was and had not cared how old the victim was, and that she had intended to rob whomever she encountered. <br /><br />Could the defendant properly be convicted of aggravated robbery of the elderly?",multiple-choice,"No, because the only evidence on the issue showed that the defendant did not know, nor could she reasonably have known, the victim's age.","No, because there was no evidence of a substantial risk that the victim was age 65 or older.","Yes, because the evidence was clear that the victim was 66 years old, and the statute is designed to protect the elderly.","Yes, because the jury could find that there was no justification for the defendant's conduct and that she was willing to take the risk that the victim was age 65 or older.",4,"Answer D is correct. The mens rea or scienter standard for a conviction under the statute is recklessness, defined as disregard of a substantial and unjustified risk. Given the totality of the circumstances--including the crime's location, the victim's age, and the defendant's intent and unjustifiable actions--a jury could properly conclude that the defendant had acted with reckless disregard of the victim's age. Thus, Answer D is correct, and Answers A and B are incorrect.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. The result in this response is correct, but the reasoning is wrong. While a jury could properly convict the defendant, it could do so only after finding that she acted with the requisite mens rea or scienter.

Answer B is incorrect; the woman's later withdrawal does not affect her liability for her actions up to that point. While it is possible to withdraw from a conspiracy, after one has aided or abetted another with the intent that the actions be committed, withdrawal will not apply. Answer C is incorrect; the woman did not need to know the exact specifics of the man's conduct to bear criminal responsibility for them.","General Principles"
"A defendant was upset because he was going to have to close his liquor store due to competition from a discount store in a new shopping mall nearby. In desperation, he decided to set fire to his store to collect the insurance. While looking through the basement for flammable material, he lit a match to read the label on a can. The match burned his finger and, in a reflex action, he dropped the match. It fell into a barrel and ignited some paper. The defendant could have put out the fire, but instead left the building because he wanted the building destroyed. The fire spread and the store was destroyed by fire. The defendant was eventually arrested and indicted for arson.<br /><br />The defendant is",multiple-choice,"guilty, because he could have put out the fire before it spread and did not do so because he wanted the building destroyed.","guilty, because he was negligent in starting the fire.","not guilty, because even if he wanted to burn the building there was no concurrence between his mens rea and the act of starting the fire.","not guilty, because his starting the fire was the result of a reflex action and not a voluntary act.",1,"The correct answer is A. Arson is not a specific intent crime; instead it requires malice on the part of the defendant. To establish malice in an arson case, the prosecution need only show that the defendant recklessly disregarded an obvious or high risk that the burning of the structure would occur. It is important to note that questions on the MBE that are testing on other arson issues (such as malice) will often impliedly follow the modern trend that the structure does not need to be the dwelling of another. Since the answer choices focus on intent, do not get hung up on the fact that the defendant's actions do not fall within the common law definition of arson.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because negligence alone is insufficient proof of malicious burning. However, the defendant's recklessness, combined with the obvious risk of the burning, demonstrates malice. Answer C is incorrect because arson requires only the malicious burning of the building, not the specific intent to burn the building down. Answer D is incorrect because the burning need not be intentional, as long as it is a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions. By allowing a minor fire that he started to spread throughout the building with the intent to destroy the building, the defendant maliciously burned the property and is guilty of arson.","Other Crimes"
"A husband and wife took their 12-year-old son to a political rally in an auditorium to hear a controversial United States senator speak. The speaker was late, and the wife stepped outside the auditorium to smoke a cigarette. While there, she saw a man placing what she believed to be a bomb against the back wall of the auditorium. She went back inside and told her husband what she had seen. Without alerting anyone, they took their son and left. Some 20 minutes later, the bomb exploded, killing 8 persons and injuring 50. In the jurisdiction, murder in the first degree is defined as an intentional homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation; murder in the second degree is defined as all other murder at common law; and manslaughter is defined as either a homicide in the heat of passion arising from adequate provocation or a homicide caused by gross negligence or reckless indifference to consequence.<br /><br />As to the deaths of the eight persons, what crime, if any, did the wife commit?",multiple-choice,Manslaughter.,"Murder in the first degree.","Murder in the second degree.","No crime.",4,"Answer D is correct.

"A state statute divides murder into degrees. First degree murder is defined as murder with premeditation and deliberation or a homicide in the commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping. Second degree murder is all other murder at common law.<br /><br />In which of the following situations is the defendant most likely to be guilty of first degree murder?",multiple-choice,"Immediately after being insulted by the victim, the defendant takes a knife and stabs and kills him.","Angered over having been struck by the victim, the defendant buys rat poison and puts it in the victim's coffee. The victim drinks the coffee and dies as a result.","Intending to injure the victim, the defendant lies in wait and, as the victim comes by, the defendant strikes him with a broom handle. As a result of the blow, the victim dies.","The defendant, highly intoxicated, discovers a revolver on a table. He picks it up, points it at the victim, and pulls the trigger. The gun discharges, and the victim is killed.",2,"The correct answer is B. First degree murder in this jurisdiction is defined as murder with premeditation and deliberation or homicide in the commission of certain enumerated felonies. First degree murder is also a specific intent crime; therefore, in this jurisdiction first degree premediated murder (as defined by the statute) requires a premeditated intent to kill. All other murders at common law will be second degree murder in this jurisdiction. Deliberate means that the defendant made the decision to kill in a cool and dispassionate manner. Premeditated means that the defendant actually reflected on the idea of killing beforehand, even if only for a brief period. Answer B is the best answer because it contains evidence of both premeditation and deliberation. The acts of going out and buying the poison and putting it in the coffee show a thought out plan with a premeditated intent to kill. The defendant also had sufficient cooling off time to act with deliberation.<br /><br />Answer A is not as good of an answer as Answer B. Answer A has fewer facts that support premeditation and deliberation. In some cases, adequate provocation can reduce a killing down to voluntary manslaughter. In this case it is unclear the nature of the relationship between the victim and defendant. Although “mere words” often are not enough for adequate provocation, it is still a question usually submitted to a jury. In this case as well, there is little time to form a premeditated intent (although time is usually not the deciding factor), and little evidence of a cooling off period for necessary deliberation.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because the defendant was lacking the premediated intent to kill. While lying in wait is normally indicative of premeditation, here the intent was only to injure not to kill, evident by the choice of weapon. Although the defendant did not have the specific intent to kill, he likely still had the intent to inflict great bodily injury or at the least criminal negligence. This crime would likely be second degree murder or involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect because voluntary intoxication may be a defense to first degree murder. To be a defense, the intoxication must negate the required intent for the crime, which is consequently why voluntary intoxication is only a defense to specific intent crimes. In this case, the intoxication likely negates the specific intent to kill. Additionally, the seemingly chance discovery of the revolver and its immediate discharge likely negate any deliberation.",Homicide
"A new lawyer has three clients, all of whom are indigent. To improve the appearance of his office, he decided to purchase some new furniture and to pay for it out of future earnings. Wearing an expensive suit borrowed from a friend, the lawyer went to a furniture store and asked to purchase on credit a desk and various other items of furniture. The lawyer told the store owner that he was a very able lawyer with a growing practice and that he expected to do very well in the future. The store owner agreed to sell him the items on credit, and the lawyer promised to make monthly payments of $800. The lawyer has never had an income from his practice of more than $150 a month. The lawyer's business did not improve, and he did not make any payments to the furniture store. After three months, the store owner repossessed the items.<br /><br />If the lawyer is charged with obtaining property by false pretenses, his best argument for being NOT guilty would be that",multiple-choice,"even if he misled the store owner, he intended to pay for the items.","he did not misrepresent any material fact.","the store owner got his property back and so suffered no harm.","the store owner could have asked for payment in full at the time of the purchase.",2,"The correct answer is B. Obtaining property by false pretenses requires the transfer of title to the property through fraud or false statements. The lawyer, when he obtained the property, did not misrepresent any material fact, and so did not obtain the property through fraud or false statements. The lawyer honestly believed his business would grow and, although his payment schedule was over his income level, he did not perpetrate fraud on the owner. The lawyer's best argument for being not guilty is that he did not obtain the property as the result of knowingly fraudulent misrepresentations of fact.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because guilt under the charge of false pretenses does not require that the lawyer never intend to pay for the furniture. If the owner gave over title and possession of property based on material misrepresentations, it does not matter if the lawyer meant to pay for it; he would still be guilty of false pretenses. Answer C is incorrect because the eventual return of the property obtained is not a defense to a charge of false pretenses. In addition, the owner did suffer the loss of the furniture for three months and the loss of the payments for the furniture, so he did, in fact, suffer harm. Answer D is incorrect because the mere fact that the store owner could have arranged for a different payment plan or for the total payment to be made up front is not a defense to the charge of false pretenses. The lawyer's best argument for being not guilty of false pretenses is that he did not misrepresent any material fact.","Other Crimes"
"A babysitter, while baby-sitting one night, noticed that the next-door neighbor had left his house but that the door did not close completely behind him. The babysitter said to the 11-year-old boy she was baby-sitting, ""Let's play a game. You go next door and see if you can find my portable television set, which I lent to the neighbor, and bring it over here."" The babysitter knew that the next-door neighbor had a portable television set and the babysitter planned to keep the set for herself. The boy thought the set belonged to the babysitter, went next door, found the television set, and carried it out the front door. At that moment, the neighbor returned home and discovered the boy in his front yard with the television set. The boy explained the ""game"" he and the babysitter were playing. The neighbor took back his television set and called the police.<br /><br />The babysitter is",multiple-choice,"not guilty of larceny or attempted larceny, because the 11-year-old boy did not commit any crime.","not guilty of larceny but guilty of attempted larceny, because she never acquired possession of the television.","guilty of larceny as an accessory to the 11-year-old boy.","guilty of larceny by the use of an innocent agent.",4,"The correct answer is D. The babysitter is criminally responsible for the 11-year-old boy's actions, and, even though the boy did not have the mens rea necessary for the commission of larceny, the babysitter did, so she is guilty of larceny. With the intent to commit larceny, the babysitter aided and abetted the boy in the taking of the next-door neighbor's property, so she is criminally responsible for the larceny. <br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because, although the 11-year-old boy did not commit a crime, the babysitter did because she used him as an innocent agent in the commission of larceny, and she had the requisite mental state. Answer B is incorrect because larceny requires the taking of the property of another without the owner's consent, and with the intent to deprive the owner of the property. The television need not have been in the babysitter's possession for her to bear criminal responsibility for the taking of the television. Answer C is incorrect because, although she bears criminal responsibility for the 11-year-old boy's actions, she is not his accessory because he did not have the intent to commit the larceny. The boy was the babysitter's innocent agent, and the babysitter used him to commit larceny.","Inchoate Crimes"
"A woman and her sister took a trip to the Caribbean. When they passed through U.S. Customs inspection upon their return, the customs officials found packages of cocaine stitched inside separate carry-on bags belonging to each of them. They were arrested. Upon separate questioning by customs officers, the woman broke down and cried, ""I told my sister there were too many officers at this airport."" The sister did not give a statement.<br /><br />The woman and her sister were indicted for conspiracy to import cocaine. They were tried separately. At the woman's trial, after the government introduced the above evidence and rested its case, her lawyer moved for a judgment of acquittal on grounds of insufficient evidence.<br /><br />Should the court grant the motion?",multiple-choice,"No, because the evidence shows that both the woman and her sister agreed to import cocaine.","No, because the evidence shows that both the woman and her sister possessed cocaine.","Yes, because the evidence shows only that the woman and her sister committed separate crimes of cocaine possession.","Yes, because the evidence shows that the woman effectively withdrew from the conspiracy when she cooperated by giving a statement.",1,"Answer A is correct. A conviction of conspiracy requires proof of an agreement to commit a crime and, in some jurisdictions or under some statutes, proof of an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. The conspiratorial agreement need not be proven through direct evidence, as long as the circumstantial evidence taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution is sufficient to allow a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a conspiratorial agreement. Here, because a jury rationally could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt from all the circumstances (including the woman's statement about her discussion with her sister) that the woman and her sister had agreed to import cocaine, the issue is for the jury, and the woman is not entitled to a court-ordered acquittal. Thus, Answer A is correct, and Answer C is incorrect.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. A conviction of conspiracy requires proof of an agreement to commit a crime and, in some jurisdictions or under some statutes, proof of an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. The fact that both the woman and her sister possessed cocaine does not necessarily show that they agreed with each other to do so.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. A defendant cannot effectively withdraw from a conspiracy simply by confessing to the conspiracy after the crime is complete. There is sufficient evidence of conspiracy in this case to send the case to the jury.","Inchoate Crimes"
"A girl told a man she would like to have sexual intercourse with him and that he should come to her apartment that night at 7 p.m. After the man arrived, he and the girl went into the bedroom. As the man started to remove the girl's blouse, the girl said she had changed her mind. The man tried to convince her to have intercourse with him but after ten minutes of her sustained refusals, the man left the apartment. Unknown to the man, the girl was 15 years old. Because she appeared to be older, the man believed her to be about 18 years old.<br /><br />A statute in the jurisdiction provides: ""A person commits rape in the second degree if he has sexual intercourse with a girl, not his wife, who is under the age of 16 years.""<br /><br />If the man is charged with attempting to violate this statute, he is",multiple-choice,"guilty, because no mental state is required as to the element of rape.","guilty, because he persisted after she told him she had changed her mind.","not guilty, because he reasonably believed she had consented and voluntarily withdrew after she told him she had changed her mind.","not guilty, because he did not intend to have intercourse with a girl under the age of 16.",4,"The correct answer is D. An attempt charge requires that the defendant have the intent to commit the crime and that the defendant take substantial steps toward the commission of the crime. The man did not have the intent to commit rape in the second degree, and therefore, should be found not guilty.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect because, although the charge of rape in the second degree does not require the man to know that the girl is under the age of 16, he cannot be found to have committed attempted rape because he did not have the requisite intent to commit the crime. Attempt is a specific intent crime. Even if the underlying crime has a lesser mens rea requirement, the man cannot be convicted of attempt without having the specific intent that rape in the second degree be committed.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect because it ignores the specific intent requirement for an attempt charge and instead addresses the issue of whether or not the man committed a ""substantial step"" toward the commission of the offense. However, he cannot be convicted of rape in the second degree even if he is found to have committed a substantial step toward it, because he lacked the requisite mental state.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect because it ignores the specific intent requirement for an attempt charge, and because consent is irrelevant to rape in the second degree or attempt to commit rape in the second degree. Therefore, because the man lacked the requisite mental state for an attempt charge, he should be found not guilty.","Inchoate Crimes"

To be an accessory to a criminal charge, the defendant must have the intent that the crime be committed and aid and abet in the commission of the crime. The friend, not knowing that the man was committing bigamy, had no intent to aid or assist the man in the commission of bigamy and should be found not guilty.<br /><br />Answer A is incorrect. An accessory, if he has the requisite intent, need only give encouragement or aid in the commission of the offense; he need not be the legal cause of the action.<br /><br />Answer C ignores the requirement that the friend have the proper mental state for the commission of the offense before he can bear criminal responsibility. Answer C is incorrect.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. Principal in the second degree, like other common law descriptions of accessories, also requires intent that the offense be committed.

The statute itself defines the required mental state by stating that the defendant must ""knowingly"" fail to file the required report. Here, if the jury believes the defendant did not know that he had sold over $50,000 worth of prescription drugs, and thus he did not know that he had to file the report, they should find him not guilty. The mens rea requirement was not met in this case.<br /><br />A is incorrect. Since the statute specifically states the mens rea requirement, it takes precedence over common law requirements of a public welfare offense, which generally are strict liability offenses.<br /><br />B is incorrect. While the defendant's poor record keeping may violate a different offense, it did negate the mens rea requirement of ""knowingly"" failing to file, and thus, is a valid defense to the criminal charge.<br /><br />C is incorrect.

To be guilty as an accomplice, the alleged accomplice must give aid, counsel, or encouragement to the principal with the intent to encourage the crime. Here, the girlfriend is guilty as an accomplice to both burglary and larceny because she provided aid to the man with the intent of helping him not only to break into the shed but also to steal the mower (the object of the breaking); the fact that the man ultimately used an alternative means to accomplish his crimes does not eliminate the girlfriend's accomplice liability.

The issue is whether the neighbor was privileged to use deadly force in self-defense given the situation. A person may use deadly force in self-defense when: (1) he is without fault (i.e., not the aggressor or provoker), (2) he is confronted with unlawful force, and (3) he is threatened with imminent death or great bodily harm. In this case, the husband was clearly the aggressor, and used unlawful deadly force in attacking the neighbor with the knife. Additionally, there is no indication that the neighbor provoked the attack. Therefore, the neighbor was privileged to use deadly force in self-defense, and is not guilty of murder.<br /><br />A is incorrect because the neighbor's right to be in the house is not the proper justification for self-defense. C is incorrect because the neighbor's presence in the woman's bedroom is not an act of provocation that would invalidate the neighbor's privilege of self-defense.

When determining the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a charge, the appellate court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the state. In this case, the marksman placed his target so that, if he missed, he would be shooting in the direction of the children; he fired numerous shots from a rifle in the direction of an occupied playground and killed a child.
