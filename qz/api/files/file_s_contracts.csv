"1. Janice purchases health insurances from ConRip Insurance. The insurance policy written by ConRip Insurance excludes from coverage ""any disease of organs of the body not common to both sexes."" Janice develops a fibroid tumor, which can occur in any organ, in her uterus. When Janice files a claim, ConRip Insurance denies coverage. In a law suit by Janice against ConRip, which of the following is the most likely outcome?",multiple-choice,"Janice will prevail. Although the policy is ambiguous because ""not common to both sexes"" can modify ""disease"" or ""organs"", this ambiguity is likely to be constructed against the drafter.","Janice will prevail based on the doctrine of reasonable expectations.","ConRip will prevail because they have substantially performed.","ConRip will prevail. Although the policy is ambiguous because ""not common to both sexes"" can modify ""disease"" or ""organs"", the purpose of the contract is to exclude coverage of male and female reproductive organs.",,,1,"A    In choosing between reasonable interpretations, a court may construe a contract against the party who drafted it. This is not true of collaborative efforts or where one party of reasonably equal bargaining power drafts a contract as a matter of convenience for the other party. This maxim is especially true of adhesion contracts where the contract is drafted by a dominant party with no reasonable bargaining ability by the other party, such as the insurance contract at issue. Choice Bis incorrect because in this case there is more than one reasonable interpretation and no commonly accepted custom is indicated. Choice Cis incorrect because it pertains to determining damages, not to contract interpretation. Choice Dis incorrect, though it is the second-best answer, because it is unknown if the proffered interpretation is the intent of the contract.","Ambiguous Contract"
"2. Sarah Seller, president and owner of Comps, a company that sells discounted computers, ordered 500 computer chips from Chippers, a manufacturer of computer chips. The terms of the transaction were that Comps would pay $500 for the computer chips, all of which would be delivered by the end of business on December 31, 2008. On December 21, 2008, Chippers sent the shipment, which was delivered to Comps on December 23, 2008. Upon inspection by Sarah, 475 of the computer chips were in perfect condition, but there were some problems with the other 25, ranging from nicks to bent edges. Sarah, incredibly annoyed at what she saw as Chipper's shoddy shipping practices, decided she needed to send them a message. So, she accepted only 400 of the computer chips, and refused delivery on the remaining 100 computer chips. Chippers wants to know what their legal rights are before they decide whether to sue. What outcome should they anticipate?",multiple-choice,"With notice, Chippers has an absolute right to redeliver conforming computer chips by December 31, 2008, and Comps will be in breach if it does not accept them.","Comps has the right to retract their repudiation provided Chippers has not changed their position in reliance or informed Comps that it is treating the contract as breached.","Comps has committed a breach by not accepting the undamaged computer chips, and Chippers must make an election as to whether to perform or sue for damages.","Comps actions amount to an anticipatory repudiation, and Chippers may immediately sue for total breach.",,,1,"A    Assuming there is a defect in the tender or delivery of goods, UCC §2-601, often called the “perfect tender rule,” gives buyers the right to reject the whole lot, accept the whole lot, or accept any commercial unit(s) and reject the rest. The rejection must be made in good faith and not just to void an unfavorable bargain. The broad power of a buyer to reject is tempered by UCC §2-508, often called the “right to cure” section, which has two standards for cure based on when the rejection occurs. If the time in which the performance is due has not passed, the seller, with seasonable notice, can make a conforming tender by the date of performance as a matter of right (subsection 1). If the time for performance has passed, the seller with seasonable notice, may still cure within a reasonable time provided the seller reasonably expected the buyer to accept the original tender. Choice Bis incorrect because it deals with anticipatory rejection that would be a material breach. Choice Cis incorrect, though it is the second best answer, because the buyer had the right to reject the units. Choice Dis incorrect because Chippers' actions did not constitute a statement that they intended to commit a material breach of their obligation to perform.","Correction of Goods"
"3. Epstein offers to sell 50,000 shoelaces to Ponoroff for $50,000, deliverable in 30 days. On October 15, 2006, the parties sign a 27 page contract that includes all relevant details, as well as a merger clause. Epstein dies on October 16, 2006. Ponoroff is seeking fulfillment of the contract from Epstein's estate, and produces written evidence of an oral side agreement that Ponoroff could choose to be paid 50,000 euros instead of dollars if he so chose. The Epstein estate claims the merger clause prohibits inclusion of any other information. The jurisdiction in which Ponoroff brings the suit always uses the four corners method of analysis. In the side agreement admissible evidence?",multiple-choice,"Yes, when the offeree dies, courts admit all evidence.","No, even if accurate, the parol evidence will not be admitted.","Yes, the court will consider the parol evidence as it supplements the agreement.","Yes, the court will admit any evidence that explains ambiguity.",,,2,"B    Under the parol evidence rule, extrinsic evidence of prior agreements is not admissible to contradict the terms of a writing intended to be an integration. The parol evidence rule requires that the prior extrinsic evidence be offered to show that there was a consistent additional term not reflected in the contract language, or to assist in interpreting the terms of a contract. In no event, however, is evidence allowed to contradict the written expression of the parties because that expression is the best evidence of the intent of theparties. Choice Ais incorrect because the death of the offeree does not alter the terms of the contract; euros are a different currency than dollars. Choice Cis incorrect because the proffered evidence does not supplement the writing, it would contradict it. Choice Dis incorrect because there is no ambiguity with respect to “dollars.”","Parol Evidence"
"4. Which of the following theories is used to justify the giving of only expectation damages in the event of breach of contract?",multiple-choice,"Encourage efficient breaches when all parties are better off as a result.","Avoid having a party incur greater risk than could have been foreseen and protected against.","Encourage parties to keep their word and follow through with their obligations.","Avoid allowing the non-breaching party to obtain a windfall.",,,3,"C    In an action based on breach of contract, no causes of action for punitive or penal damages are available. This is true regardless of the propriety or rationale of the party breaching the contract. Choice Ais incorrect. In fact, the concept of an efficient breach wherein repudiation is encouraged where all parties will benefit economically as a result, is a hallmark of the law and economics school of thought. Choice Bis incorrect because parties should be able to assess the economic risk and plan accordingly. Choice Dis incorrect because damages in contract are intended to put a party in as good a place as the party would have been had performance occurred, not allow a party to obtain greater damages.",Remedies
"5. On December 1, 2006, WebPeanut.com, a company that sells baby products over the Internet, faxed an order to Bippy, Inc., manufacturer of baby pacifiers, for 250 pacifiers of assorted colors, to be delivered by December 24, 2006, at a wholesale cost of $1 per pacifier, with shipping to be paid by Bippy. WebPeanut's faxed form included about 30 other terms, most pertinently a provision that, prior to filing suit, the parties would agree to try to mediate their dispute in a location convenient to both parties or, if that is not feasible, by telephone. Bippy received the fax and, using Bippy's form, which did not have the mediation clause, confirmed the order. In the holiday rush, Bippy forgot all about WebPeanut's order and failed to perform. WebPeanut wishes to enforce the mediation clause, but Bippy objects. What will be the likely outcome?",multiple-choice,"While the parties did not have a contract, they behaved as though they did, and the contract will consist of what they agreed on, plus the UCC gap-fillers.","Since one of the parties is not a merchant and since Bippy did not agree to the term, it is not included.","Since the term would likely cause surprise and hardship, it is not included in their contract.","The cause will likely to be enforced.",,,4,"D    UCC §2-207, also called the “Battle of the Forms,” is intended to clarify the terms of a contract when one party uses a confirming document that has different or additional terms from the other party's document. In this case, the parties do have a definite expression of acceptance. Thus, a contract was formed under subsection 1, and subsection 2 is applied to determine which terms apply. Here, the mediation term is additional, not different (contradictory). Between merchants, the additional term becomes part of the contract unless it materially alters the contract (causes surprise or hardship). Here, a local or telephonic mediation prior to filing suit would most likely not be a material alteration and thus the term would be included. Choice Ais incorrect because subsection 3 is applicable only if the parties do not have a contract but behave as if they do. Choice Bis incorrect because most likely both parties would be found to be merchants. Choice Cis incorrect because the mediation clause would most likely not be a material alteration of the contract.","Battle of Forms"
"6. Ashira is worried about her 21-year-old son, Malachi, who is spending a lot of time at college drinking alcohol. She tells him, ""If you stop drinking alcohol and get straight A's this year, I will buy you a new stereo."" Malachi stops drinking alcohol and get straight A's. When he asks for a new stereo, she says, ""You know I was joking about that."" If Malachi sued Ashira, which of the following is the most correct?",multiple-choice,"Malachi would win. He stopped partying and got straight A's, giving Ashira the consideration she was bargaining for.","Malachi would win. They had a bilateral contract and he fully performed his end of the bargain.","Malachi would lose if the evidence showed Ashira actually was joking when she made her offer.","Malachi would lose. The fact that he stopped partying and got straight A's was a benefit to him. In order for there to be consideration, the promisee must also suffer a legal detriment.",,,1,"A    Agreements where both parties intended to contract should be enforced. Agreements where both parties know that a contract is not intended, even when the objective manifestations indicate a contract has been formed, should not be enforced. The difficult case is where one party claims to have been serious and the other party claims to have been joking. To resolve this case, ask whether a reasonable person would believe an offer had been made based on objective manifestations. If so, enforce the contract even if theofferor subjectively did not intend to contract. Here, it appears Ashira intended to make a valid offer and Malachi believed a valid offer had been made, so the contract is enforceable even if Ashira was subjectively joking. Choice Bis incorrect because the parties did not have a bilateral contract; Malachi did not promise to get straight A's. Choice Cis incorrect because it does not matter if Ashira was subjectively joking; only how it truly appeared to Malachi matters. Choice Dis incorrect because it does not matter whether the consideration was a benefit to the offeree. Malachi performed as requested in response to the offer.","Detrimental Reliance"
"7. Jeff asked his neighbor, Ron, to help Jeff install a TV antenna on Jeff's roof. Jeff had recently purchased a ladder but had not assembled it properly. When Ron climbed up the ladder, a step broke and so did Ron's leg.

Jeff visited Ron in the hospital and said, ""I will pay your medical expenses if you will promise not to sue me."" Ron said, ""Fine"". When Jeff failed to pay the expenses, Ron paid them and sued Jeff for breach of contract.

Jeff elicits Ron's admission that at the time of their agreement Ron had absolutely no intention of suing Jeff and Jeff knew Ron did not believe in settling disputes through the courts. Based on that fact which of the following statements is correct?",multiple-choice,"Ron will loose because the release of an invalid claim is not consideration.","Ron will win because he has detrimentally relied on Jeff's promise.","Ron will win because there as consideration for Jeff's promise.","Ron will win because failure to enforce Jeff's promise in these circumstances would be unconscionable.",,,3,"C    Following the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §71, consideration is a bargained-for benefit or detriment. Courts generally do not inquire into the adequacy of consideration so long as it is present. Courts generally do not examine a party's motivation in deciding whether consideration is present. In this case, assuming Ron arguably had a cause of action against Jeff, he agreed to give up that cause of action in return for Jeff paying Ron's medical expenses.Abilateral agreement to compromise a disputed claim provides consideration. Choice Ais incorrect because Ron's claim is not invalid, even if he had no intention of suing Jeff. Choice Bis incorrect because the facts don't indicate any reliance and we have a valid contract. Choice Dis incorrect because it is not unconscionable under these circumstances for the parties to compromise a disputed claim.","Breach And Consideration"
"8.Fred Freeloader, a 40 year old slacker who achieved notoriety many years before by skateboarding from one side of Manhattan to the other while hanging on to the fenders of taxis, is ready to put all that behind him and start a company that will make skateboards, surfboards, and snowboards, all bearing the ""Freeloader"" logo. There's just one problem: Freeloader has no money. He decides to approach Sam Startup, a fellow surfer and millionaire, for a loan. However, he knows Startup won't lend him the money if he just makes an appointment to see him in his office. So, on Friday night at 11 P.M, Freeloader and his friend Mike Massive, a giant of a man and an ex-boxer, pay Startup a visit. Startup is surprised to see the pair so late at night. He initially says no to the idea, but over many hours he gets so beaten down, so tired, and so afraid for his life, that he agrees to meet Freeloader at the office of Startup's lawyer to consider the idea. A week later, in the lawyer's office, Startup decides to invest and has the lawyer draw up the papers. In short order, the loan is made, and the company fails. Is startup likely to prevail in a lawsuit to rescind the transaction?",multiple-choice,"Yes, Freeloader and Massive exerted undue influence on Sam.","Yes, Startup made a unilateral mistake in believing that the company was likely to be successful.","No. There is no rescission for mistakes of law.","No. The circumstances surrounding the consummation of the transaction are unlikely to be subject to a defense that would allow rescission.",,,4,"D    This problem examines the defense of undue influence. Undue influence is unfair persuasion of a party who is under the domination of the person exercising the persuasion. The degree of persuasion that is unfair depends on a variety of circumstances. The ultimate question is whether the result was produced by means that seriously impaired the free and competent exercise of judgment. Factors courts consider include the presence of one or more persuaders; discussions at an inappropriate location or time; statements by the dominant party that the weakened party cannot seek counsel or cannot delay in reaching an immediate agreement. If found, the agreement is voidable by the weakened party. Here, although many of the factors of undue influence are present, the delay in reaching the agreement and decision to seek counsel and meet in counsel's office probably defeats an undue influence defense. Thus, choice Ais incorrect. Choice Bis incorrect because there was no actionable mistake made in the bargaining process. Choice Cis incorrect because there is no mistake of law presented in the problem.","Defense of Undue Influence"
"9. Tim, during negotiations to purchase Sue's house, told Sue that his ""last offer"" was $101,000 for the property, and ""not a penny more"". In fact, Tim and his spouse Jane had agreed that they would pay as much as $106,000 for the house if Sue was not willing to budge from her asking price of $115,000. Sue accepted Tim's offer of $101,000. A few days later, Jane volunteered to Sue that Tim would have offered Sue $106,000 if Sue had turned down the offer at $101,000. Which of the following sentences best describes the legal relationship between Tim and Sue?",multiple-choice,"Sue is entitled to rescind the contract for the sale of the house because of Tim's misrepresentation, assuming it is material.","Sue is entitled to rescind the contract for the sale of the house because of Tim's concealment.","Sue is not entitled to rescind the contract because there is no liability for intentional nondisclosure.","Sue is not entitled to rescind the contract.",,,4,"D    This problem examines the defense of material misrepresentation. Amisrepresentation is a statement not in accord with the facts. It is material if the misrepresenter knows or should have known that the misrepresentation would induce the recipient to enter into the agreement. The misrepresentation defense is available to a party reasonably induced to enter into a contract as a result of false information provided by opposing party during bargaining process. In this case, while there was a misrepresentation, which may have been material, the recipient was not justified in relying upon it. It is understood that parties may misrepresent how much they are willing to pay for something in the bargaining process. Thus, choice Ais incorrect. Choice Bis incorrect because there is no concealment in this case. Choice Cis incorrect because there is no intentional nondisclosure in this case.","Material Misrepresentation"
"10. Party A sends an offer to party B by mail. B then receives the offer. B then mails an acceptance. A then mails a revocation to B. B then receives the revocation. A never receives B's acceptance. In this circumstances, what is the most accurate statement of the legal principle that governs this sequence?",multiple-choice,"A contract is formed because B's acceptance was sent before A's revocation was received.","A contract is formed because B's acceptance was sent before A's revocation was sent.","A contract is not formed because A's revocation was sent before B's acceptance was received.","A contract is not formed because A's revocation was received before B's acceptance was received.",,,1,"A  This problem examines the application of the “mailbox” rule. This rule, followed by most courts, states that an acceptance of an offer is effective when dispatched — i.e., when put in the mailbox. The theory behind the rule is that the offeror, as “master of the offer,” could specify any means of acceptance she wanted, but chose to create a risk of the acceptance being lost. As such, it is fair to put the burden of the loss on the offeror. The mailbox rule is applicable only to acceptances. As such, when Asends the offer and Bdispatches the acceptance, a contract is formed at that moment. Choice Bis incorrect because the acceptance took place before Areceived the revocation. Choice Cis wrong because it is not relevant when A's revocation was sent. Choice Dis incorrect because it is not relevant when B's acceptance is received since the contract was formed when B's acceptance was dispatched.","Mailbox Rule"
"11. Allen decided to play a joke on his classmate, Paul. He told several of his friends that he would make Paul an offer of $3,000 for his used car. The vehicle has a fair market value of $1,500. The next time Allen and Paul met, Allen offered Paul $3,000 for his vehicle. Paul immediately said, ""I accept your offer. I will deliver the transfer papers to you tomorrow."" Allen said nothing. When Paul presented Allen with the ""pink slip"" the next day, Allen and his friends burst into laughter. Allen said, ""It was all a big joke, and you fell for it."" Paul was very upset and walked away. Based on these facts, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"A contract occurred because Paul was reasonably entitled to believe that Allen's offer was seriously made.","A contract occurred under the doctrine of estoppel because Paul was subjected to the ridicule of his friends.","No contract occurred because Allen's offer was not seriously made.","No contract occurred because Allen had previously told his friends that the offer would not be serious.",,,1,"A  The law does not expect people to be mindreaders. For this reason, if a party says that he's making an offer, we assume that he means it. The offeree is entitled to respond to the offeror's actions and manifestations, so long as they appear to be reasonable. An offer to buy a $1,500 car for $3,000 is not so unreasonable that the offeree should not be able to rely on it. The correct answer is choice A. Choice Bis incorrect. The doctrine of promissory estoppel requires some action or forbearance by the offeree to his detriment. Rest. 2d §90(1). The facts do not indicate that Paul took any action in response to Allen's offer except to offer him the transfer documents. Choice Cis incorrect because it begs the real issue. It doesn't matter whether Allen was serious or not. What matters is that he manifested seriousness. Choice Dis incorrect because, again, although his statements to his friends confirmed that he intended a jest, he did not appear to Paul to be acting in jest.",Offer
"12. Seller verbally offered to sell her home to Buyer for $100,000. The offer was later confirmed in a writing prepared and signed by Seller. The written offer stated, ""I hereby offer to sell my home at 202 Neptune Street to you for $100,000, all cash."" In response to the written offer, Buyer said, ""I'll think about it."" Seller responded: ""All right, but please let me know within two days."" The next day, Buyer called Seller and said simply, ""I accept your offer."" Seller now refuses to go ahead with the sale. Based on these facts, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"The agreement was unenforceable because no writing was signed by Buyer.","No contract was formed because Buyer's promise was unenforceable, and thus Buyer gave no consideration for Seller's promise.","No contract was formed because Seller had a right to revoke her offer since Buyer gave no consideration for the promise to keep the offer open for two days.","A valid contract exists between Seller and Buyer.",,,4,"D  Buyer accepted the offer within the time specified. None of the defenses apply. Choice Cis a correct statement of law, but does not fit the facts. Absent consideration (or an exception), Seller had a right to revoke, despite the promise to keep the offer open. But Seller did not revoke the offer before Buyer accepted; Seller refused to perform only after Buyer accepted. Choice Ais factually correct, but legally insufficient. The agreement providing for the transfer of an interest in land is within the Statute of Frauds. Rest. 2d §125. This law requires a writing signed by the party to be charged — here, the Seller, who is resisting enforcement. Seller's written and signed offer was sufficiently definite to satisfy this requirement. Rest. 2d §131. Because Buyer's acceptance was communicated by phone and not in writing, the contract would not be enforceable against Buyer if Buyer raised the Statute of Frauds as a defense. Choice Bsuggests the unenforceable promise was not consideration for Seller's promise. That is wrong; even an unenforceable promise can satisfy the requirement of consideration. Rest. 2d §78.","Formation of Contracts"
"13. Malachi tells Ashira, ""I offer to sell you my 2009 black Toyota Prius for $28,000."" Ashira is worried that she doesn't have enough money, so she ask Malachi if he'll leave the offer open until 10:00 A.M. the next morning. Malachi says, ""Okay, if you'll give me $10 so I can buy some gas to get home."" Ashira looks in her wallet and says, ""I only have $5; is that okay?"" Malachi says, ""Deal. Anything's better than nothing,"" and takes the money. That evening, following a victorious Redbull chugging contest, Malachi dies. Also, right before the contest, Malachi sold the Prius to his professor for $29,000. The next day, Ashira goes to Malachi's house at 9:00 A.M. and says, ""I accept the offer"". She is then told of the death and the sale. Ashira ultimately sues to enforce the contract. Is it likely the court would find that there was an enforceable contract?",multiple-choice,"No, death terminated the offer.","No, the offer was revoked prior to acceptance.","Yes, regardless of the sale and death, the offer was accepted.","Yes, but only because the offer was accepted prior to Ashira learning of the sale or the death.",,,3,"C  While it is true that death terminates a revocable offer, this is not the case with option contracts. When Ashira gives Malachi $5 to hold the offer open, the parties have entered into a “mini-contract” in which Ashira has paid for the option to purchase the car and neither death nor the sale of the car can terminate the offer. She accepted within the allotted time, so a contract was formed. Choice Ais therefore incorrect as death did not terminate the offer. Because there was a valid option contract, it could not be revoked during the option period. Choice Bis incorrect because Ashira's knowledge of the death or sale is irrelevant. Choice Dis incorrect because knowledge of the death or sale makes no difference provided acceptance occurs within the valid option period.","Formation of Contracts"
"14. New Frisco High School boy's cricket team has a tradition of hazing its freshman players by having them take LSD, an illegal hallucinogenic drug and then playing a match. This year the captains of the team made sure each freshman signed a statement before the game began that said, ""I, (name), promise to participate fully in the cricket match, including the LSD ingestion, and I agree that binding arbitration will be the sole forum for the adjudication of any claim made against the school in connection with the match.""

"15. Buyer and Seller (both merchants)  agree over the phone that Seller will sell the Buyer 500 metal tubes at $5 each. Buyer informs the Seller that the tubes will be incorporated into one of his products. The parties do not discuss Buyer's remedies in the event of Seller's default. The next day, Seller sends a ""Confirmation"" to Buyer. The confirmation recites the quantity and price but states that in the event of a breach by Seller, the Buyer's only remedy is to return the defective goods and recover the purchase price. Seller ships the tubes to Buyer, which accepts delivery and incorporates the tubes into one of its products. Subsequently, Buyer finds that the tubes are defective and the products are unsaleable. Buyer sues and seeks to recover damages. Which of the following is correct?",multiple-choice,"Buyer can recover its damages because the remedies limitation in the ""Confirmation"" was a material alteration of the oral agreement.","Buyer can recover its damages because the default terms of the UCC apply unless the parties writings agree on a different term.","Seller will prevail because the limitation on remedies in his Confirmation was a condition that Buyer accepted by accepting delivery.","Seller will prevail because Buyer did not object to limitation on remedies within reasonable time.",,,1,"A  A written confirmation of an oral agreement operates as an acceptance even if it states terms different from the terms of the agreement. UCC §2-207(1) (UCC §2-206(3) in the 2003 revisions to article 2). However, in transactions between merchants, the additional terms might become part of the contract unless they contain material alterations of the original terms. UCC §2-207(2)(b) (deleted under 2003 revisions). Here, the language limiting the remedies of the Buyer on Seller's default was a sufficiently material alteration to be excluded from the bargain. *Choice Bis not correct under existing law but will become correct if the 2003 revisions become law. If the parties had not made an agreement at all, UCC §2-207(3) might produce the result in choice B. But if the term had not been material, Buyer's silence might have been deemed an acceptance, producing an agreement that would obviate recourse to UCC §2-207(3). Thus, choice Bis true only if choice Already prevented the term from becoming part of the contract. Choice A, then, is a better answer. Choice Cis not correct. The limitation was not an express condition to acceptance of delivery, but a material change imposed by the Seller's form of Confirmation. Choice Dis incorrect because an objection is unnecessary when the additional term materially alters the agreement.","Contract Terms"
"16. Paul, a job printer, called Seller and asked for the price of ""two tons of 50lb. white paper."" Seller told Paul he would calculate the price and then responded, via signed letter dated April 1, ""Our price for the next three weeks will be 52 cents per pound."" One week later, Seller sent another letter to Paul. It stated that because of a devastating forest fire, the price of the paper would be raised to 80 cents per pound. One week after Seller's second letter, Paul sent a signed letter to Seller stating, ""I accept your offer of paper at 52 cents in your April 1 letter. Please ship two tons ASAP."" If Paul attempts to enforce the original offer against Seller, it is more likely that",multiple-choice,"Paul will prevail because Seller's April 1 letter was a firm, non revocable offer.","Seller will prevail if his performance has become commercially impracticable.","Seller will prevail unless Paul has committed printing jobs in reliance on Seller's April 1 offer.","Seller will prevail because the April 1 letter was not an offer but a price quotation.",,,4,"D  In commercial transactions, a buyer often asks a supplier for a price in advance of placing an order. He may wish merely to compare the price of one supplier against the price of a competitor. A price quotation is, therefore, not always an offer. The facts, in this case, would indicate that Seller was merely stating a price in anticipation of Paul's order. Since Paul did not respond until Seller changed the price after the forest fire, there was no agreement between the parties. Choice A is incorrect because the April 1 letter was not a firm offer but a price quotation. Choice Bis not the best answer because the facts are not dispositive on the issue of practicability. We are not told what the impact of the fire on Seller will be. If he is able to sell his inventory at the increased price, there may be no impact at all. Choice C is not the right answer because Paul was not entitled to rely on the April 1 quotation, especially since his order was placed only after he had received notice of the price increase.","Formation of Contracts"
"17. Neff and Owens owned adjoining residences in Smithville. In May, they hired a contractor to lay a continuous sidewalk running in front of both their homes. Each man was to pay the contractor for that part of the work measured by the width of his property. After he had paid the bill that the contractor submitted to him, Neff reasonably (but erroneously) became convinced that the contractor had mistakenly charged him for labor and materials that were used for that part of the sidewalk in front of Owen's home. Neff asked Owens to reimburse him for the amount that he thought he had erroneously paid the contractor. After a lengthy discussion, and although he believed that he owed Neff nothing, Owens finally said: I want to avoid trouble, so if you agree to forgo the money, Ill hire a caretaker to keep our sidewalks free of ice and snow this winter. Neff orally agreed.

Owens decided to go to Florida for the winter. He left without hiring anyone to remove snow and ice in front of either property. When the first snow fell and the sidewalk was not cleared, Neff cleaned his own sidewalk and then kept it clean the rest of the winter. Was Owen's promise to hire a caretaker supported by consideration?",multiple-choice,Yes.,"No, because Owens did not believe that Neff had a valid claim.","No, because Neffs claim was groundless.","No, because the agreement between Neff and Owens was not in writing.",,,1,"A  When a party agrees to forbear from asserting a claim which he honestly (albeit mistakenly) believes to be valid in exchange for the promise of another, the latter's promise is ordinarily enforceable; Rest. 2d §74. Even though Owens may have owed Neff nothing, his promise to Neff would still be enforceable by Neff, because Neff believed that Owens did owe him reimbursement for Neff's overpayment to the contractor. Choice Bis incorrect because the fact that Owens did not believe Neff had a valid claim is not pertinent under the facts and the applicable rule of law (i.e., Owens' promise is enforceable because Neff believed that he had a claim against Owens). Choice Cis incorrect because it doesn't matter that Neff's claim was in fact groundless: So long as he reasonably believed he had a valid claim, Owens' promise is enforceable. Finally, choice Dis incorrect because the agreement did not have to be in writing. It provided for performance by Owens over a single winter.

The next day, Shirin sent a signed letter to Ning to confirm the contract, which Ning received. One week later Shirin showed up with $4,500 and demanded the thumbscrew. Ning denied ever entering into such an agreement, pointed out that she did not sign anything, and refused to sell the thumbscrew.

Grant's shipment of the Model Y Hearing Aids constituted an acceptance of Axel's offer (even though the goods were nonconforming) and also a breach of contract because Axel tendered nonconforming goods.

"21. Paul walks past a building that is under construction. Dan is about six feet behind Paul when he notices a loose brick falling from the top of
the building. Dan rushes at Paul and pushes him in the back to get him out of the bricks path. The brick misses Paul but shatters Dans hand and forearm. Grateful for Dans help in avoiding a blow that might have killed him, Paul comforts Dan as he lies on the sidewalk, writhing in pain. He says, ""You saved my life. Ill never be able to repay you, but I will pay all your hospital and medical expenses. And Ill pay whatever income you lose while you're mending."" In too much pain to speak, Dan nods.

Later, Paul refuses to pay Dan any money. In an action to enforce the alleged promise in a jurisdiction that follows the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"Dan will prevail because it would be unjust not to enforce Pauls promise.","Paul will prevail because he did not request Dans assistance.","Paul will prevail because there was no consideration for his promise to Dan.","Paul will prevail because Dan did not unequivocally accept his offer.",,,1,"A  The question requires us to construe the facts under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. The Restatement follows the minority view in cases involving promises to pay for past humanitarian acts. The majority view is that these promises are not enforceable for lack of consideration. The Restatement, on the other hand, follows the decision in Webb v. McGowin on the theory that the promisee received a material benefit and it would be unjust to allow him to avoid his promise. Rest. 2d §86(1). Under these facts, it's clear that Dan probably saved Paul's life, to his own detriment. Under the Restatement, his promise will be enforceable. Choice B is wrong because the Restatement does not require that the promisor request the services. In a case such as this one, the services arise under circumstances that make a request impossible. Choice C is incorrect because under the Restatement no consideration is required. Choice D is incorrect because no response by Dan was required. The facts indicate that he did nod, but the result would be the same even if he were unable to respond at all. What makes Paul's promises enforceable under the Restatement view is the underlying notion that the contrary result would create an injustice.","Formation of Contracts"
"22. Questions 22-23 are based on the following fact situation:

On December 20, Carl, the owner of Carls Coffee Shop, entered into a written contract with Dan, owner of Dan's Doughnut Factory, under which Carl agreed to purchase from Dan all his doughnut requirements for the next calendar year. The contract provided that ""Carl shall have no obligation to accept any specified quantity of doughnuts, but only all his daily requirements and that Dan ""agrees to supply your requirements at a fixed price per dozen specified in the contract, cash on delivery. During the year, Carls requirements of doughnuts averaged approximately 50 dozen per week.

The parties renewed the contract for a second year. After three months, Dan experienced a rise in his costs and decided he could no
longer afford to supply Carls requirements at the price fixed in their agreement.

If Dan asserts that the agreement is not binding on him because of lack of consideration, will Dan prevail?",multiple-choice,"Yes,because requirements contracts lack mutuality of obligation.","Yes,because the provision that Carl had no obligation to accept any specified quantity made the contract illusory.","No, because requirements contracts do not need consideration to be enforceable.","No, because Carls agreement to buy his requirements was sufficient consideration for Dans agreement to supply those requirements.",,,4,"D  The modern view, as represented in the UCC, is that neither party to an output or requirements contract can evade obligation with impunity, but may avoid the obligation only if, in good faith, they have no requirements or output. UCC §2-306. Agreement to accept this limitation is consideration. Choice Ais incorrect because mutuality of obligation is not required (as long as consideration exists). Rest. 2d §79(c). In addition, both parties have obligations to act in good faith. Choice Bis incorrect because the facts tell us that Carl had an obligation to purchase all of his doughnuts from Dan. Carl cannot withdraw from the contract at will, but is committed to buy from Dan unless, in good faith, Carl has no requirements for doughnuts. The contract was not illusory. Choice Cis not the best answer because it implies that consideration is not needed to support a requirements contract. The UCC rules create obligations that satisfy the requirement of consideration, but do not create an exception to the requirement.","Formation of Contracts"
"23. Questions 22-23 are based on the following fact situation:

On December 20, Carl, the owner of Carls Coffee Shop, entered into a written contract with Dan, owner of Dan's Doughnut Factory, under which Carl agreed to purchase from Dan all his doughnut requirements for the next calendar year. The contract provided that ""Carl shall have no obligation to accept any specified quantity of doughnuts, but only all his daily requirements and that Dan ""agrees to supply your requirements at a fixed price per dozen specified in the contract, cash on delivery. During the year, Carls requirements of doughnuts averaged approximately 50 dozen per week.

Assume instead of the facts in question 22 that six months into the second year of the contract, Carl opened Carls Coffee Shop No. 2 in a new office building. In the previous four months, Carl had ordered an average of 50 dozen doughnuts per week from Dan. The first week after the opening of the second shop,he ordered 75 dozen doughnuts, explaining that he needed the larger quantity for the two shops. Dan refused to supply any more than 50 dozen at the price fixed in the agreement.

Is Dan justified in his refusal?",multiple-choice,"Yes, because Carl demanded an unreasonably large increase over the prior needs.","Yes, because the opening of Carls Coffee Shop No. 2 was an unanticipated occurrence that excused Dan from his contract with Carl.","No, because the agreement provided that Dan would supply Carls requirements of doughnuts at the fixed price.","No, if in opening Carls Coffee Shop No.2, Carl relied on his requirements contract with Dan.",,,1,"A  A requirements or output contract involving the sale of goods must meet the test of fairness and good faith — that is, “no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or, in the absence of a stated estimate, to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements, may be tendered or demanded.” UCC §2-306(1). Since Carl's prior requirements had been 50 dozen doughnuts per week, the increase to 75 dozen doughnuts (a 50 percent increase) would probably be considered unreasonably disproportionate to the parties' prior dealings. Choice Bis incorrect because there is no rule of law that permits the supplier to a requirements contract to refuse to perform because of an “unanticipated occurrence” external to and independent of the buyer's requirements. Choice Dis incorrect because a buyer is not entitled to rely on a requirements contract to create new outlets and then insist on deliveries unreasonably disproportionate to his previous orders.

"24. Joan (a consumer) purchased a three-piece living room set from Norton, Inc., a local dealer. Norton presented loan with a three-page agreement, signed by Norton's president at the foot of the document, above a signature line under which his name was typed. Joan signed the contract on a line parallel to the presidents after her name was typed underneath. On page 2, the contract contained a clause that stated that it could not be modified, except in a writing signed by both parties. Joan did not place her signature or her initials alongside this clause. loan paid for the set by paying $200 down and agreeing to pay an additional $500 in five monthly installments. She paid the first two installments and then noticed a long tear in the back of a sofa. She went to the store and demanded a refund. Norton suggested instead that they reduce the remaining payments to $50 per month instead of $100. Joan agreed but refused to make any further payments. Norton sued for $300. 

Based on these facts, What is the likely result?",multiple-choice,"Norton will prevail because the agreement to reduce the price was not in writing. ","Joan will prevail because she was not bound by the no-oral-modification clause.","Norton will prevail because Joan signed the agreement.","Norton will prevail because there was no consideration for its agreement to reduce the price.",,,2,"B  A consumer who deals with a merchant is at a disadvantage when required to sign an agreement on the merchant's form. In recognition of this, the UCC frowns on contract clauses that prevent modification of contracts between merchant and customer except by a writing. These are called no-oral-modification clauses. The clause will be ineffective unless it is separately initialed or signed by the customer. UCC §2-209(2). Under these facts, Joan did not sign or initial the no-oral-modification clause and was not bound by it. Her oral agreement with Norton to reduce the price is therefore effective against Norton's efforts to recover the full price. Choice Ais wrong because the agreement to reduce the price did not have to be in writing. Joan was not bound by the no-oral-modification clause. Choice Cis incorrect because, although Joan signed the agreement itself, she did not separately sign the no-oral-modification clause. Choice Dis incorrect because contracts for the sale of goods are an exception to the general rule that contracts may not be modified if the modification benefits only one party; between seller and buyer, a modification needs no consideration. UCC §2-209(1). (Note: If the new agreement was deemed an accord rather than a modification, Joan's failure to perform the accord might permit Norton to sue on the original agreement. Rest. 2d §281.

"25. Ben applied to ABC Bank for a loan to expand his florist business. ABC agreed in writing to make the loan. The writing specified that the loan would be repaid within six months, at interest of 10 percent per annum, a legal rate in that state. The writing was countersigned by Ben. Before the closing and delivery of the funds, however, the loan officer indicated that ABC might need the guarantee of Joe Smith, Ben's wealthy uncle. Ben verbally assured the officer that the guaranty would be no problem. The loan closed without the guarantee. The next day, the officer called Ben and informed him that Joe Smiths guarantee was necessary after all. Ben approached Ioe with ABCs standard guarantee form and requested his signature. Joe signed the guarantee and Ben delivered it to ABC. Despite the infusion of funds, Ben's business has failed, and he is unable to repay the loan. ABC asks Joe to honor his guarantee. Joe refuses to pay, and ABC sues.

If we construe these facts under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts and the UCC",multiple-choice,"ABC will prevail because of the relationship between Joe and Ben.","ABC will prevail because no consideration was necessary for the execution of the guarantee. ","Joe Smith will prevail because there was no consideration for the guarantee executed by him.","Joe Smith will prevail because ABC closed the loan before asking for the guarantee.",,,2,"B  If a guarantee is not given until the principal debt has already been created, there would appear to be no consideration to support the guarantee. This is the view of many jurisdictions. However, the more modern view is that if the guarantee is in writing, it will be enforceable. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts requires that the writing make some references to a purported consideration, even if none is really paid. Rest. 2d §88(a). The UCC is even more liberal; it requires only that the guarantee be in writing — no recital of consideration is necessary. Under these facts, the written guarantee of Ben's Uncle Joe would be clearly enforceable by ABC Bank. Choice Ais incorrect because, although it was clearly the motivating force behind the guarantee, the relationship between Ben and Joe is not necessary to support the guarantee; the guarantee of a friend would be treated in the same way. Choice Cis incorrect because both the Restatement and the UCC dispense with the need for consideration. Choice Dis incorrect because it is exactly in those cases in which the principal debt is incurred before the guarantee that both the Restatement and the UCC will support the subsequent guarantee.","Breach And Consideration"
"26. Questions 26-30 are based on the following fact situation:

An acceptance is ordinarily effective when it is dispatched. Anna's offer did not stipulate a specific mode of acceptance, and, in any event, Ella used the same means as Anna — a wire. Because Ella's wire was sent before Anna's revocation was received by her, Ella's acceptance was valid. Choice Bis incorrect because a revocation may be made by any reasonable means. In this instance requiring speed, a telephone call was certainly reasonable. However, the call came too late. Ella had already dispatched her acceptance. Choice Cis incorrect because Anna would be presumed to know Ella's usual fee: the facts tell us that Ella had performed for Anna previously.

Under these facts, however, Anna's wire was clearly not a request to quote a fee for performing. On the contrary, it was a desperate cry for help and required an immediate acceptance. Anna did not reserve the right to select only one of the three performers to whom she sent her wire. She knew, or should have known, that all three might accept. Choice Cis the correct answer. Choice Ais incorrect. If Anna had not intended to assume the risk of receiving more than one acceptance, she could have wired one at a time and waited for an answer, or she could have made it clear in her wire that she was soliciting three responses and that the first to accept would be hired. Choice Dis incorrect because it doesn't matter who accepted first. All three would be able to recover if they accepted. Finally, choice Bis incorrect because Anna's objective manifestations govern, regardless of her secret intent.

On the contrary, his surgeon had advised that he would not. Sam's recovery was therefore a subsequent event unknown to either party at the time of contract. An offeree's rights are not affected by a supervening event that is not in the contemplation of either party. The correct answer is choice D. Because Anna did not suspect that Sam might recover, she did not condition her offer to Anna on his continued incapacity. Choice Ais incorrect on the facts as stated. Anna's offer made no mention of the possibility that Sam might recover; on the contrary, it cited Sam's illness as the reason for requesting Ella's appearance. Choice Bis incorrect. Although illness will sometimes operate to excuse default in a personal services contract, Sam's illness was relevant only to Sam's performance, not to Ella's. Choice Cis wrong. Although it is arguably a good answer, it is not the best answer. The fact that Ella's contract came after Sam's is not critical; if Ella's appearance had been conditioned on Sam's continuing illness, the order of contracts would not have mattered.","Formation of Contracts"

Anna had wired, “You must arrive no later than June 29,” not “Let me know if you're coming.” Choice D is incorrect because, as we have seen, some offers can be accepted either by a return promise or by performance.
            Choice B is wrong because it is not Stella's best argument. Anna could not reasonably be charged with knowledge that Stella would cancel another engagement, and in any event, Stella can rely on her appearance as a valid acceptance entitling her to be paid her usual fee. Choice C is wrong because Anna's wire was at least ambiguous as to whether it expected a response other than performance (Stella's appearance).","Formation of Contracts"

(Note: Because Corey went to college, as Alex requested, many courts would find Corey gave consideration.) However, Corey did not satisfy the condition Alex imposed — he did not get an all-A average.

You may sue only for the 60 percent in the settlement agreement because Frank is insolvent and can file for bankruptcy.",,,1,"A  Creditors are often confronted with the need to renegotiate the terms of payment in response to the financial improvidence of their debtors. They are asked to reduce the obligation, to extend the period of payment, or both. The traditional view has been that even if a creditor agrees to these modifications, he is not bound by them for lack of consideration. Without an exception — a promise to change the duty (e.g., pay sooner), a dispute over the validity of the debt, reliance on the promise to forgo part of the debt, or changed circumstances that make reduction fair and equitable — this agreement is not enforceable. Even if the agreement was enforceable as an accord, Frank's failure to perform the new agreement may permit Paul to insist on full payment. Rest. 2d §281.
            Choice Ais the best answer. Choice Bis incorrect for the loan described here, but would be correct if the contract arose under article 2 of the UCC, where §2-209 permits good faith modifications without consideration. Choice Cwould be correct in some jurisdictions that are still trying to hold onto the old rule (Foaks v. Beer), but are permitting some inroads so long as the creditor gets something new to support his agreement. But choice Cis not the best answer. Choice Dis also not the best answer. It relies on a consideration — Frank's abstention from a filing in bankruptcy — that Frank did not agree to give. Nothing in the facts suggests Frank promised not to file for bankruptcy.","Formation of Contracts"
"33.  Bob sells radios. His friend and neighbor of more than ten years, Arthur, is a C.P.A. Bob puts a note in Arthur's mailbox. It reads, “You've asked me if I'll sell my '87 Volvo. I'll sell it to you for $2,000. I'll keep this offer open for two weeks.” A week later, Bob has not heard from Arthur, so he puts another note in Arthur's box. It reads, “I have to cancel my offer on the Volvo. My Toyota's transmission is gone, so I need the Volvo.” Arthur immediately knocks on Bob's door and says, “You can't go back on your offer. You said it was good for two weeks, and I want the Volvo. Here's your $2,000.” Arthur tenders a check for $2,000 to Bob and demands the car.
On these facts, if Arthur commences an action for specific performance of the transaction, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"A.   Bob will prevail because he revoked his offer for good reasons.","B.   Bob will prevail because there was no consideration for his promise to keep the offer open for two weeks.","C.   Arthur will prevail because Bob's offer was binding as an option contract.","D.   Arthur will prevail because Bob's offer was a firm offer not subject to revocation.",,,2,"B  Ordinarily, an offer is revocable by the offeror at any time. This is true even under these facts, which state that Bob's offer was “open for two weeks.” Unless the offer created an option, it remains revocable. Choice Cis wrong. Only the recitation of a purported consideration is required by the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §87(1)(a). Bob's offer, however, does not state any consideration at all for the promise to keep the offer open, but merely states the price of the car. Thus, it is not an option. Choice Dis wrong because Bob is not a merchant of cars. A written offer signed by a merchant to buy or sell goods is irrevocable without consideration for the time stated. UCC §2-205. Choice Ais wrong because Bob's reasons do not matter. If the offer created an option, it would be irrevocable despite good reasons; if not, it would be revocable even for bad reasons.","Formation of Contracts"

Tom tendered 55 cents to Jim, but Jim refused to sell the coin. Jim said that the coin had already been sold to Zeke for $100 prior to the start of the special sale, but that Jim had forgotten to remove it from the display case. Tom sued Jim for damages. What result is likely?</p>",multiple-choice,"A.   Jim wins because the ad was not an offer.","B.   Jim wins because 55 cents was not sufficient consideration for a coin worth $100.","C.   Tom wins because he relied on the ad in traveling to Jim's shop.","D.   Tom wins because Jim's ad was an offer that Tom accepted when he tendered the 55 cents to purchase the coin.",,,1,"A  Most mass-media advertisements are not offers to sell. Instead, they are an “invitation to the public to come and purchase.” Craft v. Elder & Johnson Co.; Rest. 2d §26, cmt. b. The rationale is that the ads rarely contain precise information on price, availability, and so on. The ad in this case was especially sketchy. It did not state what coins were being sold, the quantity of each kind of coin, or even that the special sales price applied to all the coins. Choice Ais the best answer. Choice Bis not a good answer because the law does not require adequacy of consideration. Rest. 2d §79(b). In any event, because there had never been an offer to sell the coin at any price, the parties were free to negotiate a price and Jim was free to reject Tom's offer. Choice Cis incorrect because even if Tom's reliance satisfied the requirement of consideration, it would not overcome the absence of an offer. Choice Dis wrong because, as we have seen, Jim's ad was not an offer but an invitation to Tom to come and examine Jim's merchandise.","Formation of Contracts"
"35. Questions 34-36 are based on the following fact situation:
Tom is a teacher of numismatics. He is an acknowledged expert in coins and their value. His collection is worth thousands of dollars. Tom regularly buys and sells coins. Jim, who had no prior experience with coins, inherited a sizable coin collection. Jim opened “Coin Shop” in a local shopping center.

35.  Assume that Tom telephoned Jim and learned that Jim owned 50 silver dollars minted in 1937. Jim agreed to sell them to Tom for $1,000, which sum Tom agreed to pay in advance of shipment. Following the conversation, Jim sent Tom this letter: “This confirms your purchase of 50 silver dollars. On receipt of your check for $1,000, the coins will be shipped to you as agreed. /s/ Jim.” Tom received the letter, but did not respond to it and did not pay the $1,000. A month later, Jim sued Tom, who asserted the Statute of Frauds as a defense. Will this defense succeed?",multiple-choice,"A.   No, because the letter signed by Jim satisfies the writing requirement against Tom.","B.   No, because the face value of the coins is less than $5,000.","C.   Yes, because there is no writing signed by Tom.","D.   Yes, because a memorandum signed after the contract is made does not satisfy the Statute of Frauds.",,,1,"A  The facts of this question establish that both Jim and Tom were merchants (Jim operates a coin store and Tom deals in coins). The sale of goods between merchants is covered by several special provisions of the UCC. Between merchants, if a written confirmation of the contract is sent by the seller within a reasonable time after the sale, the Statute of Frauds is satisfied unless the purchaser objects in writing within ten days after receiving the confirmation. UCC §2-201(2). Choice Ais therefore the correct answer. Choice Bis incorrect because in the absence of a transaction between merchants and in other special circumstances, the UCC requires that all sales contracts for goods at a price greater than $500 be in writing. UCC §2-201(1). Even under the 2003 revisions of article 2, which increased the threshold value to $5,000, choice Bwould be wrong. The question will not turn on the face value of the coins, but on the price of the goods. The statute would not apply because the price is less than $5,000, but the reasoning offered in this choice is incorrect. Choice Cis incorrect because the purchaser does not have to sign the memorandum. The seller's memorandum is sufficient if it is received by the purchaser and the purchaser does not object within ten days. Choice Dincorrectly states the law. The seller's memorandum covered by the UCC always follows the sale.","Formation of Contracts"

36.  Assume the same facts as in question 35. Tom defends on the ground that there was no legally sufficient consideration for his promise to pay $1,000. Will this defense succeed?",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, because a court will not enforce a promise to pay $1,000 for coins with a face value of $50.","B.   Yes, because Jim did not change his position in reliance on the promise of Tom to pay $1,000.","C.   No, because Jim's promise to sell the coins was sufficient consideration.","D.   No, because both Tom and Jim are merchants, and contracts between merchants do not require consideration.",,,3,"C  The facts of this question raise the issue of fairness in dealing between two parties to a contract. Can a party be forced to pay $1,000 for $50 in coins? The answer is yes. So long as the parties have freely agreed to the price, there is consideration. Consideration exists when the promisee gives up something of value and the promisor makes his promise in exchange. There is no requirement that the items exchanged be of equal value. The contrary view is obviously inapplicable in the kind of exchange between Jim and Tom. Who is to say that the 50 silver dollars are not worth $1,000? We leave the parties to their bargain. Choice Cis the correct answer. Choice Dis legally incorrect (contracts between merchants do require consideration). Choice Ais incorrect because it is contrary to the facts: the courts will not ordinarily question the value of consideration in a bargain between two parties.

There is a contract for Corbin to paint Farnsworth's house in exchange for $20,000, and the job must be completed within two months.","D.

The counteroffer is for $20,000 with Corbin having 2 months in which to finish the job. When Farnsworth then says he will consider the offer and inquires about different payment and completion terms, this does not serve as a rejection of the prior offer. Corbin's offer remains active. When Corbin will not agree to the new proposal from Farnsworth, the offer from Corbin can be accepted until it is rejected. The acceptance occurs prior to the rejection, so there is a contract. Choice Ais incorrect because while the last offer was rejected, the prior offer remained valid.

"38.  Joe and Bill live on the same street. One day, Joe notices a deep dent in his car door. Checking around, he notices that Carl, Bill's teenage son, has a dent in his car as well. Joe concludes that Carl struck Joe's car when he drove out of his driveway. Joe confronts Bill with his suspicions. Bill tells Joe that he will pay to have Joe's car repaired at a body shop. Joe agrees. Later that night, Bill questions Carl about the dents. Carl insists that the dent in his car occurred when he hit a pole in his employer's parking lot. He shows Bill the accident report he submitted to his employer and establishes that the dent was caused by a car with a different paint color. In the meantime, Joe takes his car to the body shop and has the dent repaired. Bill now refuses to pay for Joe's repairs.
If Joe sues Bill for the cost of the repairs, it is most likely that",multiple-choice,"A.   Joe will prevail because Bill's promise is enforceable.","B.   Bill will prevail because both parties mistakenly believed Carl caused the dent.","C.   Bill will prevail for lack of consideration because Carl did not cause the dent.","D.   Bill will prevail because his agreement with Joe was oral.",,,1,"A  This question requires analysis of an agreement based on a mutual mistake concerning a basic assumption of the parties. Joe and Bill made their agreement on the mistaken assumption that Carl was responsible for the dent in Joe's door. Can Bill avoid his promises after he realizes that it was induced by a mistake? Many courts have held that in cases of mutual mistake, there is no contract at all and that either party may avoid it. The more modern view, however, is reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which will impose the obligation of performance under three circumstances: (1) the mistake must relate to a basic assumption, (2) the mistake must have a material effect on the agreement, and (3) the party seeking avoidance must not bear the risk of the mistake. Rest. 2d §152. These facts clearly revolve around a material mistake that was the underlying assumption of the agreement. The remaining issue is whether Bill bears the risk of the mistake. The answer under the Restatement would be yes. First of all, Joe relied to his detriment on Bill's promises. Second, and perhaps more important, Bill was “aware, at the time the contract was made that he had only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which his mistake related but treated his limited knowledge as sufficient.” This doctrine is called the doctrine of “conscious ignorance,” Rest. 2d §154(b), illus. 1. Thus, choice Bis wrong. Choice Cis wrong because Joe waived his claim against Carl in exchange for Bill's promise. Even if Joe's claim was invalid, waiving it will be consideration as long as Joe honestly believed it was valid at the time the contract was made. Choice Dis wrong because the agreement did not have to be in writing.",Defenses
"39.  Builder and Owner verbally agreed that Builder would install a driveway leading to Owner's garage for $5,000. The job was to be completed in one month, at which point Owner would pay Builder in full. Builder asked Jonathan to supply him with the cement he needed for $1,000. Jonathan agreed, and Builder wrote a memo to Owner, instructing him to pay $1,000 of the sum due him directly to Jonathan. Builder completed the job on schedule, but the work was defective and unacceptable to Owner. Owner refuses to pay either Builder or Jonathan.
If Jonathan sues Owner, the likely result is that",multiple-choice," A.   Jonathan will prevail even if Builder did not perform his work in a reasonably competent manner, as long as Jonathan supplied concrete in a competent manner.","B.   Owner will prevail if Builder did not perform his work in a reasonably competent way.","C.   Owner will prevail because Builder could not assign his right to payment before the work was finished.","D.   Owner will prevail because the contract involves land and there was no writing.",,,2,"B  A party to a contract may freely assign his rights under the contract. This principle makes an assignment of rights somewhat different from a delegation of duties. No consideration is required for the assignment, which operates as a present transfer. In this case, however, the delivery of cement by Jonathan constituted consideration. The assignment does not have to be in writing, but, here, Builder gave notice of the assignment to Owner. The assignment from Builder to Jonathan is a partial assignment of payment because Builder retained his rights to the balance. At common law, partial assignments were not permitted. These days, however, the courts generally allow partial assignments. The right to make a partial assignment is recognized in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. Rest. 2d §326(1). Generally, the partial assignee cannot sue the obligor without naming the assignor as co-plaintiff. In any event, the assignee “stands in the shoes of the assignor” and is subject to all the defenses, set-offs, and counterclaims that the obligor can assert against the assignor. The best answer is choice B. Because Builder did not perform his work in a reasonably competent manner, he cannot recover and Jonathan cannot recover. Choice Ais wrong because any defense Owner has against Builder will also apply to Jonathan. Builder cannot assign greater rights than it has. Choice Cis wrong because Builder could assign the right to payment at any stage in the work; however, the Owner was not required to make payment until the work was completed. Choice Dis incorrect. Although the contract relates to land, it does not involve the transfer of an interest in land. Only agreements to transfer or buy an interest in land are within the Statute of Frauds; contracts to build on or improve land are not.","Third Party Beneficiary"
"40. Questions 40-42 are based on the following fact situation:
Youth is a 17-year-old boy who has been buying and selling bicycles since he was 11. Teller is a 25-year-old bank teller who has never bought a bicycle before. Teller asked Youth if he had a bicycle to sell. Youth showed Teller a bicycle with a slight crack in the frame. Teller asked if the slight crack would impair the bicycle's utility, and Youth said, “Not a bit.” In fact, the crack would probably cause the frame to collapse after very little use. Youth knew this, but Teller did not. Teller said, “Very well, I'll pay you $100 for the bicycle and pick it up tomorrow.” They both signed a writing, prepared by Youth, which purported to memorialize the terms of their agreement. Later that day, Teller learned that the crack would probably cause the frame to collapse after little use.

40.  If Teller tells Youth he will not accept the bicycle and Youth asserts a claim against Teller for damages for breach of contract, who will prevail?",multiple-choice,"A.   Teller, because Youth is a minor and lacks capacity to contract.","B.   Teller, because he relied on a material misrepresentation.","C.   Youth, because the contract is voidable only at Youth's election.","D.   Youth, because Teller's reliance on Youth's statement was not reasonable.",,,2,"B  A party to a contract has the same defenses against the minor as against any other party. If a minor misrepresents a material fact on which the other party justifiably relies to his detriment, the latter has the option of rescinding the agreement or of asserting the defense of breach. Rest. 2d §164. Youth's misrepresentation of the condition of the bike entitles Teller to defend against Youth's claim. Choice Ais incorrect. Although persons under 18 are classified as infants in most states, an agreement by an infant is voidable by the infant but enforceable by the infant against the other party to the agreement. Rest. 2d §14. Choice Cwould be correct if Teller asserted incapacity, but this has no bearing on the defense of misrepresentation. Because Teller will raise misrepresentation, this response is not the best answer. Choice Dis incorrect because the facts indicate that Teller's reliance was reasonable.

If Youth voids the agreement, there's nothing Teller can do. Choice Bis a valid statement of the law, but it is immaterial to the issue: Youth's right to avoid the contract.

42.  Assume the writing prepared by Youth purports to describe the bicycle by serial number, but Youth mistakenly inserts serial number 100B, the number of another bicycle in his possession, instead of number 100A, the number of the bicycle at issue. At the time the writing was signed, Teller knew that the wrong serial number was contained in the writing.

The rationale is that the mistake vitiates the entire agreement. Teller will show that the bicycle described in the contract was not the one the parties intended to describe. Choice Cis the correct answer. Choice Dis incorrect because the transaction did not come within the Statute of Frauds (under UCC §2-201, only contracts for the sale of goods with an aggregate price of $500 or more are within the Statute of Frauds; the amount will increase to $5,000 or more if the 2003 revisions to article 2 are adopted).

Finally, choice Bis incorrect because the fairness of a deal is no basis to require a party to accept goods she never agreed to buy. (Note: Youth could prevail by suing for the failure to accept bicycle 100A. The parol evidence rule will not preclude evidence that the writing incorrectly recorded the parties' agreement. If clear and convincing evidence shows that the parties agreed to the bicycle with the crack in the frame, the writing can be reformed to reflect the correct serial number and enforced accordingly — subject to other defenses, such as misrepresentation.)","Contract Terms"
"43.  Seller entered into a written agreement with Buyer. Seller agreed to provide 5,000 widgets to Buyer at a price of $7,500. A few days later, Seller assigned in writing to Bradley “all of my rights under my contract with Buyer for the sale of widgets.” Bradley was another widget distributor with an excellent business reputation. The assignment did not contain an assumption by Bradley of Seller's obligations under the contract. Bradley failed to deliver the widgets to Buyer on time, and Buyer was unable to complete a job requiring the widgets.
If Buyer sues Bradley, the result will be",multiple-choice,"A.   Bradley will prevail because he never expressly agreed to assume Seller's duties under the Buyer/Seller agreement.","B.   Bradley will prevail because he was not in privity of contract with Buyer.","C.   Buyer will prevail because Buyer is a third-party beneficiary under the agreement between Seller and Bradley.","D.   Buyer will prevail because Bradley indemnified Seller.",,,1,"A  The best answer is choice A.Atransfer of one's rights under a contract is an assignment.Atransfer of one's duties under a contract is a delegation.A“general assignment” of the entire contract operates both as an assignment and a delegation. UCC §2-210(4); Rest. 2d §328(1). These facts tell us that Seller “assigned all my rights under my contract” to Bradley. This language ordinarily means both an assignment of rights and a delegation of duties. UCC §2-210(5) (UCC §2-210(3) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). But the facts also state that “the assignment did not contain an assumption by Bradley of Seller's obligations.” This negates a delegation of duties. Thus, when Bradley did not perform, he was not liable either to Seller or to Buyer. Choice Bis not as good an answer as choice A. The concept of privity is a complicated one that applies generally when there is a succession of interests between one party and another (e.g., assignor and assignee, or testator and beneficiary), or when there is a mutuality of interest in a contract or property right. If Bradley had agreed to the delegation, he would have been liable to Buyer regardless of privity, so choice Ais the better answer. Choice Cis wrong.Adelegation to Bradley would make Buyer a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Because Bradley did not promise to perform Seller's duties, there could be no third-party beneficiary of a promise. Choice Dis wrong because it is contrary to the facts.

Before the UCC, many courts declared these contracts unenforceable for lack of consideration. Under the UCC, these contracts are enforceable. UCC §2-306. Choice Ais incorrect. Although Buyer is not committed to order any office furniture if he needs none, Buyer must determine his needs in good faith and cannot simply back out of the deal on a whim.

Choice Bis the best answer. Although the Buyer could have enforced the Seller's agreement even without reliance, his reliance under these facts is another reason to bind the Seller. Choice Cis wrong. Even though Buyer had no purchase or sales history, the court would impose a standard of good faith in the absence of a minimum or estimated quantity. There is nothing in the facts to indicate that Seller was unable to meet Buyer's needs, especially prior to his very first order.

Under these facts, however, the contract is sufficiently definite to satisfy the UCC requirements: it fixes the term by which the quantity is to be measured (i.e., one year), the price to be paid by Buyer (i.e., 10 percent below listed wholesale), and the commodity to be sold (i.e., office desks and chairs). Choice Bis wrong; in the absence of a “best efforts” clause, Buyer would be expected to use only reasonable efforts to sell the desks and chairs. Choice Cis wrong because it is not necessary to know Buyer's needs in advance of his orders. McMichael v. Price. Choice Dis wrong on the facts. The price was fixed at 10 percent below the Seller's quoted wholesale price. (Note: If Buyer placed no orders because it changed its mind, in good faith, about entering this new product line, no breach would occur because Buyer's needs would be zero. The cancellation would be ineffective, however, where Buyer does have orders from customers, as stated in the facts to the previous problem.)","Contract Terms"
"46.  Joe was a highly successful tire manufacturer. He sold most of his production to Rubberco. When Rubberco's requirements increased, it suggested to Joe that he expand his facilities. Joe asked ABC for a loan to finance the expansion. ABC reviewed Joe's earning records and decided it could not make the loan without a supporting guarantee. Joe asked Rubberco to act as guarantor. Rubberco called ABC, where it had a substantial account, and told the bank officer, “Don't worry, we'll be responsible for Joe's loan.” Without asking for a written guarantee, ABC made a loan to Joe of $100,000.

If Joe is unable to repay the loan, can ABC recover the loan from Rubberco?",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, if it can show that it would not have made the loan but for Rubberco's statement.","B.   Yes, because Rubberco guaranteed payment of the loan.","C.   No, because Rubberco did not guarantee the loan in writing.","D.   No, because Rubberco's words were not the language of guarantee.",,,2,"B  In the case of a guaranty given simultaneously with the creation of the debt, as in this case, there is consideration to support the guaranty — the detriment incurred by the creditor in making a loan to a debtor it would not otherwise accept. The correct answer is therefore choice B. Choice Ais incorrect because ABC does not have to prove reliance. The mere fact that Rubberco gave the guaranty will be sufficient to support its claim. Choice Cis incorrect. Ordinarily, a guaranty needs to be in writing. Rest. 2d §110(b). Because Rubberco's guaranty seems to be motivated by its own advantage (obtaining more tires from Joe), the promise falls outside the Statute of Frauds. Rest. 2d §116. Choice Dis wrong. The words “we'll be responsible for” will be given their conventional meaning of assurance or commitment, making them equivalent to the word “guaranty.”","Formation of Contracts"
"47.  Shalanda knew that Kevin was having financial trouble and that his rent was due in two days, so when she saw him buying bags of beans and rice in the store, she told him, “I will buy your entire collection of first edition Superdude comic books for $250.” Kevin responded, “You know those comics are worth ten times that much to a collector.” Shalanada said she knew “but you can't find a collector before your rent is due. Think about it and let me know. You have my cell number.” Two hours later Kevin called Shalanda and said, “Okay, I accept, although I think what you're doing is wrong. I'm insulted and I think you should be in jail for even suggesting it.” Shalanda responded, “Well if you feel that way about it, forget about it,” and hung up. Which of the following statements most likely describes the relationship between the parties?",multiple-choice,"A.   There is a bilateral contract between Kevin and Shalanda with Shalanda having an obligation to buy the comics and Kevin having an obligation to sell them.","B.   There is no contract between the parties because Shalanda revoked the offer within a reasonable time.","C.   There is no contract between the parties because promise for promise is illusory and does not constitute consideration.","D.   There is no contract between the parties because of the mirror image rule.",,,1,"A  Shalanda made an offer to purchase the comic books. She permitted acceptance to take place by telephone within a reasonable time. Within a reasonable time Kevin accepted. Although Kevin's acceptance was grudging, it was sufficient to form a bilateral contract. At that point, Shalanda cannot revoke her offer. Choice Bis incorrect because after Kevin accepts the offer, a contract is formed and it is too late for Shalanda to revoke the offer. Choice Cis incorrect because a promise given in exchange for a promise is not illusory; it is the basis of a bilateral contract. Both sides have an obligation to perform. Choice Dis incorrect because Shalanda made an offer and specified the means of acceptance. Kevin complied exactly, albeit grudgingly.","Formation of Contracts"
"48. Questions 48-49 are based on the following fact situation:
Daniel and Paul were involved in an automobile accident. Paul sued Daniel for $10,000, alleging that Daniel was negligent. Each party claims to have had the green light. Of the two other witnesses, one was prepared to testify that Paul had the green light. Before trial, Daniel offered Paul $5,000 to settle all claims arising from the accident. Paul accepted the offer.

48.  After Daniel promised to pay the $5,000, Paul dismissed the negligence suit. When Daniel suffered a large business reversal and was unable to pay the $5,000, Paul threatened to sue Daniel. On learning these facts, Ted told Paul, “Daniel is an old friend of mine. If you will not sue him, I will pay you the $5,000.” Paul said, “Okay,” and did not file suit against Daniel. A week later, Ted repudiated his promise to Paul. Paul sued Ted for $5,000. What result?",multiple-choice,"A.   Ted wins because there was no consideration for his promise.","B.   Ted wins because Paul must recover against Daniel before he can sue Ted.","C.   Paul wins because his agreement not to sue Daniel is sufficient consideration for Ted's promise.","D.   Paul wins because Ted's friendship with Daniel is sufficient consideration for Ted's promise.",,,3,"C  If a party agrees not to enforce a valid claim, her promise is sufficient “detriment” to qualify as consideration. Here, when Paul agreed not to sue Daniel, he gave up his right to recover $5,000. In exchange, he received Ted's promise of payment. The fact that Paul's promise was made to Ted does not alter the result. Rest. 2d §73, illus. 11. The correct answer is choice C. Choice Dis incorrect because Ted's friendship would not be sufficient consideration in the absence of Paul's reliance. Choice Ais incorrect because, as we have seen, there was consideration for Ted's promise to Paul. Finally, choice Bis incorrect because there is no requirement that Paul sue and recover against Daniel before suing Ted. The contrary result would be economically wasteful and unreasonable.","Formation of Contracts"
"49. Questions 48-49 are based on the following fact situation:
Daniel and Paul were involved in an automobile accident. Paul sued Daniel for $10,000, alleging that Daniel was negligent. Each party claims to have had the green light. Of the two other witnesses, one was prepared to testify that Paul had the green light. Before trial, Daniel offered Paul $5,000 to settle all claims arising from the accident. Paul accepted the offer.

49.  Assume the same facts as in question 48, except that Ted defended on the ground of the Statute of Frauds. What result on this defense?",multiple-choice,"A.   Ted wins because his promise was to pay an amount in excess of $500 and was not evidenced by a writing signed by Ted.","B.   Ted wins because his promise was to pay the debt of another and was not evidenced by a writing signed by Ted.","C.   Paul wins because Ted's promise was not one required to be evidenced by a writing signed by Ted.","D.   Paul wins because his forbearance to sue Daniel constituted part performance.",,,3,"C  The Statute of Frauds covers suretyship agreements, promises to pay another's debt if they default. Rest. 2d §110. The agreement in question is not a suretyship agreement. Ted did not promise to perform in Daniel's place, but rather created an independent obligation: a promise to pay Paul if Paul would perform a service for Ted. The service was not to sue Daniel on the prior default. This is an independent service to Ted, despite the fact that it has the effect of erasing Daniel's debt. Thus, it does not fall within the Statute of Frauds. Thus, choice Bis incorrect. Choice Aalso is incorrect because the provision requiring a writing in contracts involving more than $500 applies only to the sale of goods. Rest. 2d §110(2)(a); UCC §2-201. Choice Dis incorrect because forbearance does not constitute part performance, and part performance may not be insufficient to establish an exception if the Statute of Frauds applied.

"50.  Nira owned a medieval sword valued around $25,000. Gillian wanted to purchase the sword, but throughout the negotiations Nira refused to lower her price below $24,000. Gillian refused to pay more than $22,000. After determining that they were at an impasse, both parties walked away from the negotiations. Two days later, Nira wrote a letter to Gillian, stating that she “feel[s] badly that we weren't able to reach a deal since our numbers were so close. How about I agree to sell it to you for $230.00?” Gillian immediately called Nira on the phone and said, “I accept your offer to sell me the sword for $230.00.” She then sent a cashier's check that Nira received but did not cash. Nira refused to cash the check or to deliver the sword. Which of the following best describes the legal relationship between Nira and Gillian?",multiple-choice,"A.   There is no contract between the parties because Gillian knew that Nira did not intend to sell the sword for $230.","B.   There is no contract between the parties because Gillian attempted to accept by telephone to a written offer, thus violating the mirror-image rule.","C.   There is a contract for Gillian to purchase the sword from Nira for $23,000.","D.   There is a contract for Gillian to purchase the sword from Nira for $230 because Gillian properly accepted Nira's offer, and any ambiguities in the contract in regard to the amount should be construed against Nira since she was the drafter.",,,1,"A  Correct. Gillian and Nira had been negotiating for the sale of the sword, appraised for $25,000 for a sale price of between $22,000 and $24,000 and negotiations broke down because neither party would budge on their figures. When Nira wrote to Gillian, referencing her regret that the parties couldn't reach an agreement even though their figures were so close, and then offered to sell the sword for $230.00, Gillian should have known that Nira meant $23,000.Areasonable person would not have thought the offer was for $230.00 and thus Gillian could not take advantage of the mistake. Bis incorrect because Nira did not state a specific and exclusive means of acceptance, and thus acceptance, had an offer been made, could have taken place by any reasonable method without violating the mirror-image rule. Cis incorrect because Gillian stated in her telephone call that she was accepting the offer to purchase the sword for $230. At best this is a counter-offer of what she knew or should have known was a $23,000 offer. Dis incorrect because Gillian could not accept since she knew or should have known of the error, and in any event ambiguities are not construed against the drafter of an offer.","Formation of Contracts"
"51.  Pubco is a publisher of travel guides. Filberts is a general bookstore. Filberts orders 5,000 copies of Travel in France at $8.50 per guide. Pubco acknowledged the sale in writing. Later, Pubco learned that Filberts does not intend to sell the guides in its store for $19.00 each (the usual domestic markup), but, instead, to sell them in Paris at $100.00 per guide. Pubco tells Filberts that the price of each guide is raised from $8.50 to $15.00. Filberts knows that it can buy the guides from a competitor at $10.00 per guide, but in its rush to fill the Paris order, it agrees to pay Pubco $15.00. Pubco ships the guides and Filberts accepts them but sends a check calculated at $8.50 per guide. On these facts, if Pubco sues Filberts, it is likely that ",multiple-choice,"A.   Filberts will prevail because Pubco secured the modification in price in bad faith.","B.   Filberts will prevail because there was no consideration for its agreement to pay the increase in price.","C.   Pubco will prevail because both parties are merchants and no consideration for the modification is necessary.","D.   Pubco will prevail because a seller is entitled to change the price if the buyer's margin of profit changes.",,,1,"A  In general, a contract between two parties cannot be modified without consideration if the modification benefits only one party. Here, the change in price would benefit Pubco but hurt Filberts.
            Because we are dealing with the sale of goods, however, the modification needs no consideration to be binding. UCC §2-209(1). But the UCC does impose restrictions that are meant to operate in circumstances like those reflected in these facts. It imposes the requirement of good faith, designed to prevent acts of extortion or duress by one party against the other. UCC §1-203. It also recognizes the courts' right to refuse to enforce a contract that is unconscionable. UCC §2-302. Under these facts, choice A is the best answer. Choice B is wrong because lack of consideration is not the central issue in these facts. If the modification had not been unfair to Filberts, it would have been enforceable without consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there is no difference between the treatment of merchants and others in the general application of the modification-without-consideration rule. The difference in treatment between the two arises only when there is a written agreement that contains a no-oral-modification clause and the merchant attempts to enforce the clause against a customer who asserts that an oral modification clause exists and should be enforced. UCC §2-209(2). Choice D is wrong because it misstates the relationship between buyer and seller and ignores the sanctity of contracts.","Formation of Contracts"
"52.&nbsp; Melissa works as a magician for children's birthday parties. She is well known for pulling a rabbit out of her hat with which the children can then play. Barbara contacted Melissa and asked if she would agree to perform her magic show at the birthday party of Aidan, her nine-year-old son. Barbara wanted to make sure Melissa would be available on January 15, 2012, before inviting Aidan's friends and classmates. Melissa, however, was a bit hard to pin down. Please indicate which statement by Melissa is most likely to be found to be an illusory promise:",multiple-choice,"A.

I will perform at the birthday party on January 15, 2012, unless I call first to let you know I have decided not to perform.",,,3,"C  This “promise” is illusory because it does not appear to place even a “good faith” obligation on Melissa. Choice A is incorrect because although there may be evidentiary and interpretation issues involved in proving the rabbit was sick on that day, unless the rabbit is medically ill Melissa is under an obligation to perform and hence the promise is not illusory. Choice B is incorrect because Melissa is under an obligation to perform unless she gets snowed in. Again, we may have evidentiary and interpretation issues about what constitutes “snowed in,” but the obligation to perform exists unless the condition occurs. Choice D is incorrect because if Melissa decides not to perform at the magic show, she still has a duty to call. She would likely be in breach if she did not do so and also did not perform.","Illusory Promise"

Homer waived his right to demand ½ rods, but he has retracted the waiver, and Carl must use ½ rods.","D.   Homer's statement, “Go ahead and use the ¼,” is not effective either as a modification or a waiver because Homer did not expressly agree to modify or waive the contract.",,,3,"C  The contract between the parties made compliance with the building specifications by Carl an express condition of Homer's promise to pay for the house. If a party manifests his willingness to waive a condition after the contract is executed, consideration is normally required for the waiver. However, courts are willing to recognize a waiver without express consideration if either the condition was not an important part of the original contract or the other party changes his position in reliance on the waiver. If the other party has not changed his position or relied on the waiver to his detriment, the waiver may be retracted so long as no consideration has been given for the waiver. Rest. 2d §84(2). Under these facts, the correct answer is choice C. Choice Ais wrong because Homer was free to retract his waiver until Carl changed his position in reliance on the waiver. Choice Bis wrong because the parties did not modify the contract in the sense that they both became bound to use of ¼ rods. Choice Dis wrong on the facts. Homer's statement would certainly have served as a waiver if Carl had purchased and installed the ¼ rods.","Waiver of Condition"

Nothing because his failure to install the 40-gallon heater allows Homer to treat the contract as discharged.","B.

The full contract price minus the difference in cost between a 20-gallon heater and a 40-gallon heater.",,,4,"D  If the parties clearly intend a contract but omit a term, the courts will almost universally apply the term. Rest. 2d §204. Here, the parties provided for a water heater but forgot to specify the size. It will be a simple matter for the court to conclude that what was intended was a heater large enough for the house, especially since the difference in cost between the smaller and larger heater will be insignificant for a $150,000 house. Once the omitted term is supplied, it's clear that the measure of damage is exactly the difference in cost between the two heaters. Since Carl has substantially performed (i.e., built the entire house), Homer is permitted to deduct the damages resulting from Carl's failure under the agreement. The correct answer is choice D. Choice Ais incorrect because a party is not entitled to avoid an entire agreement by reason of a minor breach that can be corrected or reimbursed. Choice Bis incorrect because the court will supply the missing term. Finally, choice Cis incorrect because although Carl substantially performed he must be charged with the difference in cost to compensate Homer for Carl's breach.","Expected Damages"

Obviously, this creates a circumstance in which the subjective judgment of a single person controls the liabilities of the parties.

Rest. 2d §228, cmt. b. However, they will also require that the architect act in good faith. Rizzolo v. Poysher. The correct answer is therefore choice B. Choice A is incorrect because the judgment of other architects is not relevant. The parties have determined between themselves whose standards they will apply. Choice C is incorrect because the court will not normally inquire into the reasonableness of the architect's judgment unless one of the parties can show that he acted in bad faith.

"<div>56.&nbsp; Peter Piper is a leading auctioneer. He retains Litho to typeset and print 5,000 glossy brochures promoting an auction to be held on August 1. The price for the brochures is $5,000, to be paid on delivery of the brochures. When Seller delivers the brochures, they contain a typo showing the date for the auction as August 3. The auction is still 30 days off, and Piper asks Litho to correct the date and reprint the brochures. Litho replies that it will correct the error if Piper will pay an additional $1,000 “to cover the cost of paper.” Piper refuses to pay the additional sum and tells Litho that he must have delivery of the brochures “in one week” if he is to get them out in time for the sale. Piper fails to hear from Litho within the week. Desperate to get the mail out, Piper contacts Printco, which agrees to print the brochures in six days for $7,000. Two days later, Litho delivers corrected brochures to Piper and demands $5,000.

Piper will prevail and recover $2,000 plus any damages resulting from the late mailing of the brochures.","D.   Litho will prevail and recover $5,000.",,,3,"C  A buyer of goods is entitled to receive goods that conform to his requirements. If the goods are defective, he is entitled to reject them. UCC §2-601(a). The facts tell us that Litho was responsible to typeset the brochure and that the mistake in dates was material. Once the goods were rejected by Piper, Litho could remedy its breach only by correcting the error in type, reprinting the brochure, and redelivering to Piper in time to avoid any damage to Piper. Litho not only failed in this duty but also affirmatively drove Piper to “cover” by demanding an increase in price. Once a buyer rejects the goods in good faith, he may resort to the remedy of “cover” (i.e., he may purchase substitute goods from another supplier). UCC §§2-711, 2-712(1). That's exactly what Piper did here. Once a buyer has covered, she is entitled to recover as damages “the difference between the cost of cover and the contract price together with any incidental or consequential damages as hereinafter defined (Section 2-715)….” UCC §2-712(2). UCC §2-715(2) defines consequential damages in language that includes facts such as these, in that Litho had reason to know that the date of the auction was material. The best answer is therefore choice C. Piper is entitled to recover $2,000, the difference between the $5,000 contract price and the $7,000 paid to Printco, plus any consequential damages resulting from the late mailing of the brochures. Choice Ais wrong only because it doesn't recognize that Piper may be entitled to consequential damages. Choice Bis wrong because $7,000 overstates its damages. It has to subtract the original contract price. Choice Dis wrong because Litho will not prevail. It breached the agreement and then tried to impose a penalty on Piper.",Breach
"<div>57.&nbsp; Builder was building a three-story office building. He entered into an agreement with Seller, a window supplier, to deliver a specified number of windows “as needed” to the construction site.

Builder faxed his order for the first delivery, which was late by one day. On the second order, Seller delivered windows with the wrong measurements, causing Builder to miss a construction deadline and incur a large penalty. The correct windows were delivered the following day and accepted by Builder. Fearing further costly delays, Builder notified Seller that their agreement was canceled.</div><div>If Seller sues Builder for damages, the likely result is that</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Seller will prevail because Builder's cancellation was premature.","B.   Seller will prevail because Builder waived a claim for breach by accepting both deliveries.","C.   Builder will prevail because Seller's failure to make timely delivery and to deliver conforming goods were a material breach of the agreement.","D.   Builder will prevail because his cancellation was proper under the “perfect tender” rule.",,,1,"A  The facts deal with an installment contract between Builder and Seller providing for nine separate deliveries. Builder has a right to reject one installment only if the defect substantially impairs the value of that installment. UCC §2-612(2). The right to cancel future installments arises only if the defect in one installment “substantially impairs the value of the whole contract.” UCC §2-612(3). Here, the first installment was late, but that minor defect did not substantially impair its value. The second installment involved the wrong goods, a more serious breach, permitting rejection of that delivery. But nothing in that delivery impaired the value of future installments. Builder's fears of future defects gave it a right to demand adequate assurances of performance, but no right to cancel the entire contract at this time. UCC §2-612, cmt. 6. The correct answer is therefore choice A. Choice Bis incorrect because Builder did reject the second installment, which Seller cured the next day. The UCC will reinstate the contract if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonable notice of cancellation. Since Builder accepted Seller's cure before giving notice of cancellation, this provision probably would not apply. Choice Cmisstates the rule. Material breach is the standard under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts but not under the UCC. The question involves whether the breaches so far substantially impair the value of the future installments. No facts suggest that future installments have lost their value. In fact, Builder almost certainly still requires future windows to finish the building. Choice Dis wrong because under the UCC, the “perfect tender rule” does not apply to installment contracts.

No, because there is a possibility that Seller could buy back the property and tender a deed to Buyer on July 1.",,,2,"B  A party to a contract may by his conduct indicate that he does not intend to perform the terms of the contract. In these circumstances, the party will be deemed to have committed an anticipatory repudiation of the contract. The other party to the agreement may then cancel his own performance and may generally institute a suit for damages even before his performance is due. Here, Seller's conduct in conveying title to a third party before July 1 was a clear and voluntary repudiation of his contract with Buyer. Rest. 2d §250(b). The correct answer is choice B.
            Choice Ais not the correct answer because Buyer has no obligation to do anything following the Seller's repudiation. Choice Cis not a correct statement of the law. Buyer does not have to wait until the date for his own performance, but may accept the Seller's act as a repudiation and sue immediately. Choice Dis incorrect.

And he does not have to ask for assurances of performance if the repudiating party's statement is unambiguous, as it is here. When Seller advised Buyer that the home would not be conveyed, Seller's conduct constituted a clear and voluntary anticipatory repudiation. Choice A is incorrect because an anticipatory repudiation can be marked by a clear and unequivocal statement that the party is unwilling to perform, without any further action. Choice C is incorrect because when an anticipatory repudiation has occurred, the aggrieved party can commence an action even though the date for performance has not yet arrived. Finally, choice D is incorrect because the aggrieved party may commence an action immediately; she does not have to wait to see if the other party really means what he says.","Anticipatory Repudiation"

Yes, because payment of the price by Buyer was a condition subsequent to Seller's duty to tender the deed.",,,1,"A  If the promised performances of both parties to a contract canoccur at the same time, the courts will normally require that they be performed simultaneously. The performances are then said to be conditions of each other, or concurrent conditions. Each party is expected to be ready to perform at the time designated. Normally, he manifests this by tendering his performance. The concept is used especially in contracts relating to the sale of goods and of land. Rest. 2d §234(1). Buyer's tender of payment is sufficient to establish readiness to perform on his part. The correct answer is choice A. Choice Bis incorrect because Buyer need only show an ability or readiness to perform by tendering payment (it would obviously be incongruous to require actual payment). Choice Cis incorrect. Buyer is required to tenderperformance (i.e., payment) to show that he has the ability to perform. Seller need not deliver a deed if Buyer is unprepared or unwilling to perform. Choice Dis wrong. Land contracts and title closings are the primary example of transactions involving the requirement of simultaneous performance, not alternating and dependent performances.",Performance
"61.&nbsp; On January 15, 2012, Mahica enters into a contract with Rosana in which Mahica agrees to babysit Rosana's two children on January 20, 2012, in return for $20 per hour. At the time they entered into the transaction, at Mahica's request, Rosana pays Mahica $100 for the five hours of babysitting that will take place the next day. On January 20, 2012, while babysitting, Mahica calls Rosana in good faith and explains that because both children have colds, and because it is so much more work to take care of two sick children than two healthy children, she thinks Rosana should pay her $25 per hour. Rosana agrees it is more difficult and agrees to pay the additional money. That said, when Rosana returns home after being gone for five hours, she refuses to pay Mahica the additional money.

Mahica will prevail because the babysitting contract was properly modified because of unanticipated circumstances.","C.   Rosana will prevail because the original babysitting contract could not be modified and Mahica provided no new consideration.","D.   Rosana will prevail because the babysitting job was no harder than either party reasonably expected.",,,3,"C  At common law, in order to overcome the pre-existing legal duty rule, modification without consideration requires (1) a voluntary agreement, (2) performance not to have been completed by either side, (3) unanticipated circumstances, and (4) that the modification be fair and equitable. Here, while the agreement is voluntary, due to unanticipated circumstances and fair and equitable, performance by Rosana has already taken place through the advance payment. Choice A is incorrect because good faith is the standard for a modification under the UCC. Here, babysitting is a service and the common law prevails. Choice B is incorrect because the agreement could not be modified without consideration if full performance has taken place on either side. Here, payment in full constitutes full performance of Rosanna's duties. Choice D is incorrect because both parties were in agreement that the job was harder than expected, but still the contract could not be modified absent new consideration.","Performance & Modification of Contract"
"<div>62.&nbsp; Bob owns a small shopping mall in Eureka. One winter's day, there is a big snowfall and the sidewalk and parking area are soon covered with snow. Bob sends his maintenance crew out to shovel the snow. Because he thinks that the law of Eureka requires him to clear both the sidewalk and the parking area, he tells his men to clear both. It's getting dark and the men clear both areas as well as they can in the dim light. Sally Smith walks on the sidewalk, slips on a piece of ice and breaks her leg. Also under the belief that Bob is responsible to clear the sidewalk, Sally threatens to sue Bob, who is uninsured. He agrees to pay Sally's medical bills. Sally's bills come to $15,000 and Bob refuses to pay her. He consults his lawyer, who advises him that the law in his state places the responsibility for clearing sidewalks on the municipality, not the property owner.

Nonetheless, her agreement not to press the claim would be valid consideration for Bob's promise to pay her medical bills. Choice C is incorrect. Choice A is incorrect because the agreement did not have to be in writing. Choice B is plausible. The existence of consideration will not negate a defense of mutual mistake. The mistake involved here is a mistake not of fact but of law (both parties believed that the applicable law made the property owner responsible to clear snow and ice from the sidewalk). Originally, courts would not afford relief to a party claiming a mistake of law. The modern view, however, is to treat a mistake in law in the same way as any other mistake, on the theory that a mistake of law is “part of the total state of facts at that time.” Rest. 2d §151, cmt. b. This defense, however, cannot apply to settlement contracts. Uncertainty over who might prevail (either on the law or the facts) is one risk the settlement resolves. No settlement would be secure if a party could avoid the contract by pleading a mistake of fact or law pertaining to the merits of the claim or defense justified rescission. Rather, mistake applies when a mistake of law (say, a zoning ordinance) materially affects the underlying consideration (say, a land sale). It is not pertinent to mistakes concerning who is right in litigation.",Consideration
"<div>63.&nbsp; Builder was hired to reconstruct a garage behind Owner's home. The agreement was in writing. After the work was completed, Owner claimed a $2,000 adjustment because the siding used by Builder was wood and not vinyl as specified in the contract. The Builder argued that wood was longer lasting and easier to maintain, and that, if anything, Owner owed him an adjustment. Their disagreement remained unresolved until Owner learned that Builder was a fellow lodge member. He called Builder and said, “Let's call it quits.” Builder submitted a written release that Owner signed and delivered. Now Owner has learned that Builder is not a lodge brother after all.

Builder will prevail because the release is enforceable against Owner, who signed it.","D.   Builder will prevail because the release was evidence that Owner no longer claimed an adjustment.",,,3,"C  Parties to a commercial agreement often argue over the quality or scope of performance by one of the parties. To encourage settlement of these disputes, the courts will generally enforce a general release of claims given by one party to the other. This practice is recognized by the UCC. UCC §1-107 (UCC §1-306 under the 2001 revisions to article 1). Choice A is therefore incorrect: No consideration was necessary for the execution of Owner's release. However, these facts confront us with a more difficult issue: Can the party executing the release reassert his claim if the release was given under a mistake or misunderstanding? When the relationship is a commercial one, the answer is no. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Jardel Co. The result may be different when the relationship is noncommercial, as in the case of a release from a personal injury plaintiff to an insurance company. The correct answer is choice C. Because this was a commercial transaction, Owner cannot avoid his release because he gave it to Builder on the mistaken impression that Builder was a lodge fellow. In any event, this is probably not the kind of mistake that would justify redress to Owner. The mistake did not relate to the underlying contract or transaction but to an extraneous and collateral fact. Choice B is therefore incorrect. Choice D is wrong because it states a conclusion that is contrary to the facts.","Enforceable Contract"

You can sue for the reasonable value of the car but not the principal of the note.","D.   You can sue in the alternative for payment of the note or payment of the reasonable value of the car.",,,4,"D  The best answer is choice D. However, under an alternative interpretation of the facts, the best answer would be choice C. The solution depends on whether we are dealing with an accord and satisfaction or with a substituted agreement. In an accord and satisfaction, one party offers and the other accepts a substitute performance in the future in discharge of an existing obligation. The promise is called an executory accord. Here, the executory accord was Orville's promise to convey title to his station wagon.
            If an executory accord is made, no discharge occurs until the new terms are performed. In the meantime, the old debt or obligation is not discharged. If neither the old debt nor the promised accord is performed or satisfied, the other party has an option: he may sue on either the original obligation or on the promised accord. Rest. 2d §281. In a substituted agreement, the parties agree that the old obligation will be discharged and a new one substituted. If the substituted agreement is not performed, the aggrieved party can sue only on the new promise, not the old one. Rest. 2d §279(2). Whether a particular transaction is an accord and satisfaction or a substituted agreement depends on the intent of the parties. Here, the agreement looks, feels, and smells more like an accord and satisfaction than a substituted agreement, so we prefer choice D to choice C, which would be the correct answer if we had a substituted agreement. Choice A is wrong under either theory: A substitute would wipe out the debt, not the car; an accord would not wipe out either one. Choice B is wrong because Bradford cannot recover both, but must choose one or the other, even under an accord.","Substituted Agreement"

The contract stated that Barney would buy Sampson's store for $125,000 “provided Barney finds a purchaser who will buy his present business for $100,000.” Prior to signing the agreement, the parties had a conversation during which they agreed that because Barney would need the money, Barney's buyer would have to pay all cash.

Yes, because Barney's promise to buy was subject to a condition within Barney's complete control and was therefore illusory.","B.   Yes, because Barney's promise to buy was still executory."," C.   No, because the court will interpret the condition of Barney's promise as requiring Barney to make a good faith effort to find a buyer for his present business."," D.   No, because Barney's promise to sell his present business was consideration for Sampson's promise to sell his business to Barney.",,,3,"C  If a promise is conditioned on the occurrence of an event that is within the exclusive or partial control of one party, most modern courts will imply an obligation on the part of the promisor to use his best efforts to make the event happen. Barney must make at least a good faith effort to locate a purchaser for his business. If he fails to do so, Sampson can successfully assert a breach of contract claim. Choice C is the right answer. Choice D is not the best answer, although it correctly states that a promise contingent on the occurrence of some event will satisfy the requirement of consideration. Choice C is a better answer than choice D because even though we find consideration, we must subsequently analyze what effect Barney's unwillingness to find a buyer would have on Sampson's promise. Choice A is incorrect because the court will read into the condition (because it is within Barney's control) the obligation to use his best efforts to find a buyer. Choice B is not correct.

I'm sorry, I tried to find an all-cash buyer as we agreed orally, but no one has come forward.

Barney wins if the judge decides that the written agreement was a partial integration of the parties' agreement.",,,4,"D  The parties to a written agreement usually engage in extensive oral discussions and negotiations before they sign the agreement. Once the agreement is signed, the parol evidence rule operates to exclude any evidence of these oral discussions that differ from the writing. The assumption is that the written agreement represents the final expression of the parties' intent. If it does, the agreement is deemed a total integration. If, on the other hand, the agreement is not intended to include all the details of their agreement, the agreement is deemed a partial integration. In the latter case, evidence of a prior oral understanding may be admitted if it does not contradict a term of the agreement. The judge, not the jury, will usually determine whether the agreement is a partial or total integration. The best answer on these facts is choice D. If the judge decides the agreement was a partial integration — a logical conclusion when we consider that the writing specified only a total price without dealing with the distribution of the price between cash and mortgage — then Barney will be able to introduce the oral understanding and win. Choice C is wrong because a decision that the agreement was a partial integration is not helpful to Sampson's case. Choice A is wrong because it offers only an objective test of whether we are dealing with a total integration or a partial integration. The issue to be resolved is the intent of the parties, and that can be determined only by the judge after hearing the evidence. Choice B is wrong for the same reason. (Note: Two other theories, not offered in any of the answers, might be tried. One argues that the agreement should be re-formed to include the condition that Barney's business be sold entirely for cash. The other argues that the agreement, though totally integrated, was conditioned on an event that did not occur. The theory is weak because the condition was included in the writing. Thus, arguing that the entire writing became effective only if the condition occurred is less persuasive.)","Parol Evidence Rule"

Without the modification, the written agreement would be unconscionable.","D.   The evidence is offered to establish a constructive condition to Barney's performance of the agreement.",,,3,"C  Under these facts, Barney's best argument is probably that the agreement as written is unconscionable. The courts will not enforce an agreement that is so one-sided as to be essentially unfair. Both the Restatement (Second) of Contracts and the UCC make provision for rejection of an unconscionable agreement. Rest. 2d §208; UCC §2-302(1). Several facts make performance of this agreement by Barney unfair: (1) He is being forced to sell an existing business; (2) he has to move to a new city; (3) he has to pay more for Sampson's business than his own business is worth; (4) Sampson is the one who has failed to negotiate a new lease; and (5) he has no assurance that his new business will be allowed to remain in its present location, or, indeed, be able to find a new location. Under these circumstances, the court can easily help Barney to be relieved of his bad bargain by re-forming the agreement to conform to the oral modification. Gianni Sport Ltd. v. Gantos. Choice B is arguably as good an answer. Most oral modifications of written agreements will be enforced without consideration, but there is always the risk that the court will insist on some showing of consideration, especially where the contract as written contains no reference to Sampson's lease. Choice A is wrong because there is no ambiguity in the writing as described. Choice D is not the best answer. Under some circumstances, the court will impose a condition as a matter of law to ensure fairness. However, constructive conditions are not normally used to impose new terms on the parties.",Defenses

She refused to pay Jack. After much argument, Jack agreed that he would wait for payment for 12 months.

Jack will recover $10,000, less the cost to Jill of maintaining the trees for the balance of the year.","D.   Jack will recover nothing because he breached the compromise agreement.",,,2,"B  The best answer is choice B. The facts we are given show only that the parties had a dispute and that they resolved their dispute in a modification that involved two basic ingredients: a promise by Jack to perform additional services in caring for the trees, and his agreement to wait for payment until the end of the year. These facts create neither an accord and satisfaction (i.e., an agreement to give a new performance in exchange for an old one) nor a substituted agreement (i.e., an agreement to perform a different duty in satisfaction of an existing one), but simply the modification of an existing contract by a change in terms.Amodification of an existing contract is enforceable without consideration even if it benefits only one party. UCC §2-209(1). Under these facts, Jill could reasonably ask for the modification to which Jack agreed. Because one of the modifications was a delay in payment for a period of one year, Jack's suit is premature. If, however, Jill repudiated the contract, choice Bwould not be correct. Choice Ais wrong because the original agreement was not supplanted. We do not have a substituted agreement, but the modification of an existing one. In addition, the modification did not eliminate Jack's right to compensation, but merely delayed it for a year. Choice Cis wrong because we cannot measure Jack's remedy at this time. If the trees do not survive, Jack may recover nothing. If they all survive, Jack's failure to water them may cause no damage to Jill. If only some of them survive, his recovery will have to be calculated. Choice Dis an arguable answer, but it is not as good as choice B. Even though Jack has not performed the modifications, his failure may not be material. If all the trees survive after one year despite Jack's failure to perform the modifications, he will probably be entitled to the agreed price of $10,000.",Remedies

Send a copy of the agreement to Parfumco and ask it to reconfirm the terms.","D.   Write to Parfumco demanding assurances of its ability to perform.",,,4,"D  An “assignment of rights and obligations” operates both as an assignment and a delegation. An assignment is a transfer of rights; a delegation is a transfer of duties. UCC §2-210(5) (UCC §2-210(3) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). Here, Scents transferred both to Parfumco. All contract rights are assignable unless the assignment materially increases the risks to the obligor, in this case, Aroma. Rest. 2d §317(2). The facts here involve a requirements contract: Aroma contracted with Scents for all its oils for a period of one year. Before the UCC, requirements contracts were not assignable. The UCC now recognizes such assignments under the proper circumstances. UCC §§2-306(1), 2-210(2) (UCC §2-210(1)(a) under the 2003 revisions to article 2).
            The assignment from Scents to Parfumco was therefore valid without the consent or acknowledgment of Aroma. Choice Ais not the best answer because there is no inherent right in the obligor to prevent an assignment. Choice Bis wrong for essentially the same reason. Scents had a right to assign and did not breach the agreement with Aroma by assigning; the agreement did not contain a no-assignment clause, and prohibitions against assignment are frowned on anyway. If Aroma suspects that Parfumco cannot or will not perform as well as Scents and that the risks to it will be increased unacceptably, it can ask for assurances because the assignment is coupled with a delegation. UCC §§2-210(5), 2-609 (UCC §2-210(2)(c) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). Failure of Parfumco to give adequate assurances will entitle Aroma to cancel the agreement.

At the end of the second month, it receives a notice from Iris Nurseries, its source of live flowers, advising OSI that Iris must suspend all deliveries because of a storm that has wiped out its flower beds. OSI can get the flowers from a nursery in Holland for $7,500 per month more than it would pay Iris. At that price, OSI will lose $7,500 per month, a loss that may cause it to fail. OSI notifies Peckendorf that it cannot make any further deliveries without an increase of $9,000 per month. Peckendorf refuses to adjust the contract, and OSI makes no further deliveries.

Peckendorf will prevail because OSI breached the agreement.","D.   OSI will prevail because the loss to it was extreme and unforeseeable.",,,4,"D  The facts illustrate the difference between two types of circumstances, each of which can operate to relieve a party from performing the terms of a contract. The first arises when the contract calls for delivery of particular goods and the goods are destroyed. When this happens, the contract is discharged if the goods are essential to the contract. On these facts, we have to ask two questions: Were the live flowers essential to the contract? And were flowers from Iris the subject matter of the contract? The answer to the first question is yes, but the answer to the second question has to be no. The flowers from Iris were not the subject matter of the contract. The contract did not specify a particular source for the flowers. Many suppliers have live flowers, and OSI's duty was not to deliver the Iris flowers, but to deliver live flowers from any reasonable source. UCC §2-615. Choice Bis therefore wrong. The other circumstance that will relieve a party of its duty to perform is impracticability.
            Impracticability is akin to impossibility, but different enough to suggest a different result in this case. It was not impossible for OSI to perform, but it was impracticable (i.e., performance would be too costly and might jeopardize OSI's very existence). The modern view is to permit discharge under these circumstances. The cost increase must be extreme, must not be foreseeable, and must not be implicit in the contract. Rest. 2d §261, cmt. d; UCC §2-615. The increase in price may not be enough by itself to justify discharge, but the threat to OSI's very existence probably is. Choice Dis the best answer.

Contractor will recover nothing until he has removed and replaced the defective material.",,,2,"B  These facts involve a dispute between the two parties over the completion of a building contract. The issue is the measure of damages following a dispute over performance. Because we are told that an architect has certified a defect in performance, we have to conclude that the defect did occur and that Contractor was in breach. Unless the breach is material, Contractor can recover on the contract, but the balance due will be offset by any damages the breach caused Homeowner. (If the breach was material, Homeowner might elect to cancel the contract, in which case Contractor could not sue on the contract, but must instead recover in quasi-contract for the fair market value of the services performed, less any damages to Homeowner.) Because the breach does not seem to be material, the measure of damage is the contract price, less the damages for defendant's breach. If the architect's estimate is correct, Contractor's recovery will be $7,000, the difference between the contract price and the cost to Homeowner of replacing the wrong material.

"<div>72.  On December 20, Carl, owner of Carl's Coffee Shop, entered into a written contract with Dan, owner of Dan's Doughnut Factory, under which Carl agreed to purchase his doughnut requirements from Dan for the next calendar year.

In May of the next calendar year, Carl sold Carl's Coffee Shop to Ed, assigning his rights and delegating his duties under the contract with Dan to Ed.

Roland calls Harpo one morning before the work begins and tells him he's changed his mind and is going to buy a plane instead. Harpo ponders his alternatives and discusses them with you. He tells you that if he sells the materials, he will recover only $30,000, but if he finishes the yacht, he is likely to sell it for $120,000. He asks you for your advice as to the course of action that will put him in the best position to recover his losses from Roland.</div><div><br></div><div>What should you advise Harpo?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Sell the materials and sue Roland for expectation damages.","B.   Sell the materials and sue Roland for reliance damages.","C.   Sell the materials and sue Roland in restitution.","D.   Build and sell the yacht and sue Roland for consequential damages.",,,1,"A  As Harpo's attorney, your responsibility is not only to guide him to the maximum possible recovery but also to prevent him from actions that may ultimately work to his disadvantage or detriment. Choice D is the only choice that contemplates the completion of the yacht in an effort to improve Harpo's position. It is a course of action that is covered under the UCC. UCC §§2-703, 2-704(2). The UCC recognizes the right of a reasonable seller to complete the manufacture of an article and resell it in the event of a breach by the buyer. However, under these facts, which tell us that construction has not begun and that the resale price is purely speculative, it would not be advisable for Harpo to proceed with construction. Choice Dis not the best answer. The other three choices all anticipate that Harpo will sell the materials for $30,000 and sue Roland for damages. What is the best measure of his damages? Choice Cis not the best answer. Restitution is available only when the plaintiff has performed a part of the contract and conferred some benefit on the defendant. In other words, the plaintiff's restitution interest is the value to the defendant of the plaintiff's performance. Rest. 2d §370. Here, Roland has received no benefit, and restitution is not the best theory to proceed on. Choice Bis incorrect because the UCC does not provide a separate remedy based on reliance. Both UCC §§2-706 and 2-708 (the basic remedies for repudiation) start by allowing buyer to recover the contract price, then subtract resale price (here, salvage value) and costs saved (here, the expense of finishing construction of the yacht). This at least will include recovery for expenses, but allows (almost requires) Harpo to try to prove that a profit would have remained after accounting for savings. Rather than give up now, Harpo should try to prove expenses. Choice Ais the best answer. It may be difficult to prove how much Harpo saved by not completing the yacht (since construction has not begun, it is almost impossible to calculate all of Harpo's costs at this time). Still, Harpo has the cost projections he used to compute the price, which serve as some basis for proving savings. Harpo's profit is somewhat speculative. Still, choice Acomports best with the damage formulations allowable under the UCC and with Harpo's best interests.",Remedies
"74.  Subdivider has received approval to subdivide a plot in Hiawatha County and to build ten two-story colonial houses. All the houses are exactly the same except for minor details in exterior decoration. He contracts with Builder to build all ten houses at a total cost of $750,000. Subdivider pays $150,000 to Builder on execution of the contract and an additional $10,000 on satisfactory completion of each house. Builder completes five houses and is paid $50,000. Subdivider and Builder have a violent argument, and Subdivider throws Builder off the job. Builder says, “You owe me $375,000 for five houses and you've paid me $200,000. Please give me a check for $175,000.” Subdivider replies, “I won't pay you anything until I build the other five houses and see how much they cost me.” Builder retains you, and you ask your associate to write you a memo outlining the best theory on which to sue. What theory is your associate most likely to recommend?",multiple-choice,"A.   Material breach by Subdivider.","B.   Divisibility of contract.","C.   Promissory estoppel.","D.   Quantum meruit.",,,1,"A  Because the associate's assignment is to construe the facts in a way that will be most beneficial to Builder, the best answer is choice A. We know that Subdivider threw Builder off the job. Unless excused by a Builder's breach or nonoccurrence of a condition, Subdivider's conduct breaches the contract. It would be hard to argue the breach was not material because it completely severed all remaining duties. Material breach may allow Builder to recover more than $375,000. Damages would be the contract price ($750,000) minus any costs saved (by not building the remaining five houses). Unless costs of construction on the last five houses will exceed $375,000, this remedy exceeds recovery on a severability theory. Choice Bis tenable. Construction contracts are often divisible (i.e., they can be divided logically into a series of separate contracts in which services are performed in stages in exchange for payments of money). Rest. 2d §240. Not all construction contracts are divisible, but this contract would seem to qualify. The houses are all the same, the price for each is the same and is separately identifiable, and the event that triggers payment — the satisfactory completion of each house — is clearly stated. If we rely on the theory of divisibility, Builder will be likely to recover the $175,000 he asked for. Choice Bwould be the best answer if facts suggested either that Subdivider was justified in throwing Builder off the job or that finishing the work would cost Builder more than $375,000. Choice C, promissory estoppel, is not the best theory to rely on. It is applied generally in situations in which one party relies to her detriment on another's promise and is usually used as a substitute for consideration. Rest. 2d §90(1). It is not applied in bilateral contracts in which the rights and obligations of each party are clearly stated. Choice Dis not the best answer. Quantum meruit is used in those cases in which the plaintiff has failed to give all the performance that was required by the contract, but has given a measure of performance that has conferred some value or benefit on the defendant. The plaintiff is allowed to recover the reasonable value of the benefit. The fair market value of the homes might be less than the contract price and certainly won't include the profit on the remaining five houses. The doctrine is not appropriate here because, at this point, Builder has given a measure of performance that can easily and reasonably be translated into Subdivider's obligation to pay a measurable sum.","Third Party Beneficiary"

The parties were concerned merely about supplying lodging to Delwood. They did not intend to confer on the Harriot the right to benefit from their promise. The Harriot is the incidental beneficiary of their agreement, not the intended one. The correct answer is choice D. Since the Harriot is not the intended beneficiary, choices A, B, and Care all wrong. Kiwanis intended no greater benefit to Harriot than to any other hotel that might lodge Delwood.

Zippro's annual production is 300,000, but it has the plant capacity to gear up, and it agrees in writing to supply all of Fabrico's needs for ten years as proposed by Fabrico.

Fabrico will prevail because Zippro could have delivered 200,000 zippers to Fabrico and the balance of its production to Skisuit.",,,4,"D  The best answer is choice D. The contract between Fabrico and Zippro is a fairly typical output and requirements contract. These contracts are covered under UCC §2-306. Because no specific quantities are set forth, the UCC imposes the requirement that the parties act in good faith to ensure a reasonably foreseeable and constant quantity. The facts tell us that Fabrico treats Zippro as its exclusive source. This commitment by Fabrico acts as the consideration for Zippro's promise to meet Fabrico's needs and imposes on Zippro the obligation to deal with Fabrico in good faith. See Eastern Airlines Inc. v. Gulf Oil Corp. Because Fabrico was a good, loyal, and constant customer for three years, Zippro did not act in good faith when it cut Fabrico off completely and prevented it from getting any zippers. The decline in Fabrico's needs was caused not by any action on its part but by the intrusion of a stronger competitor. Zippro's actions were especially egregious when you consider that it preferred Skisuit to Fabrico. Zippro could easily have served all the needs of Fabrico and some of the needs of Skisuit. Choice Ais wrong because the facts tell us that Zippro did not expand its facilities, but merely geared up to full capacity. Choice Bis wrong because Zippro could have sold to Skisuit without cutting Fabrico off entirely. Choice Cis plausible if 200,000 zippers is disproportionate to the prior year's orders and that difference constitutes a material breach. (The perfect tender rule applies to buyers, not sellers. UCC §2-601.) On the facts, the orders may be disproportionately small, permitting Zippro to recover damages for the breach, if any.

Sue and Mark have exchanged a series of invitations, offers, and counteroffers. When Sue offered to perform for $20,000 and Mark “accepted her terms,” they reached agreement on price, dates, and roles, but Sue's insistence on a written contract “for my approval” obviously confirmed her need to be sure that other possible terms — that is, the identity of the conductor, the names of other members of the cast, her hotel accommodations — would be acceptable to her.

Nothing, because the contract required pruning of two trees.","C.   $150, as the reasonable value of his services.","D.   $350, as the difference between the contract price and the cost of completion.",,,3,"C  The critical issue on these facts is whether in pruning only one of two trees, Felix committed a material breach of the contract or whether he had substantially performed the contract. Under some circumstances, it is not easy to determine whether the performance is substantial. If the performance is substantial, the party giving the performance is entitled to recover on the contract — that is, sue for his expectation damages, which are, in this case, the contract price less a setoff for defendant's damages. The defendant's damages will be measured by the cost of remedying plaintiff's default. Under those circumstances, choice Dmight be correct. But pruning one tree may not be substantial performance of the contract. The question is a close one because the work was easily divisible into two equal parts. Arguably, Felix could recover $250 for the half of the contract he completed, though this choice was not offered as an answer. For two reasons, it seems Felix did not substantially perform: (1) Felix walked off the job and should be charged with the default; and (2) the value of his work can be assessed by the cost imposed on Oscar to remedy his default ($150), given that the two trees were identical and, thus, pruning one would be no different from pruning the other. The most equitable result is to limit Felix to recover under quasi-contract in quantum meruit. This is the appropriate remedy when the plaintiff has materially breached the contract, but has given the defendant part performance that is of value to the defendant. In that case, the plaintiff will be limited to the reasonable value of his work. This is especially true in construction cases. Since the reasonable value of Felix's work can be readily measured by the cost of Murray's work, the correct answer is choice C. Choice Dis not the right answer because, as we have seen, Felix is not entitled to his expectation damages because he materially breached the contract. Choice Ais probably not the right answer, but it is a close call. Many courts will not allow any recovery to a plaintiff who has committed a “willful” default, which may be the case on these facts. Rest. 2d §374. Choice Bis wrong for the same reason that choice Ais wrong. Having performed some valuable services, it would be unjust to allow Oscar to keep the services without any compensation to Felix.",Performance
"<div>85.  Albert sold his used Alfa Romeo to Bart for $7,000. They agreed that $3,000 would be paid on transfer of title and the remaining $4,000 “in 30 days.” Bart knew that he would be unable to pay the balance. He said to his friend Otto, “Look, I need to pay $4,000 to Albert in 30 days. You need your house painted. If I paint your house, will you pay $4,000 to Albert?” Otto replied, “That sounds look a good deal to me. I agree.” Bart diligently and efficiently painted Otto's house, but Otto now refuses to pay Albert. Albert sues both Bart and Otto. What result? </div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Albert can recover against Bart but not against Otto.","B.   Albert can recover against Otto but not against Bart.","C.   Albert can recover against both Otto and Bart.","D.   Albert cannot recover against either Otto or Bart until Bart sues and recovers a judgment against Otto.",,,3,"C  When Otto agreed to pay $4,000 to Albert in exchange for Bart's painting of Otto's house, Albert became the third-party beneficiary of Otto's promise. Under the common law, a third-party beneficiary could not sue because he was considered not to be “in privity” with the promisor — in this case, Otto. Even the first Restatement allowed a third-party beneficiary to sue only if she was either a creditor beneficiary or a donee beneficiary. As now revised, the Restatement has eliminated these two classes of beneficiary and has created two new ones — intended beneficiaries (who can sue) and incidental beneficiaries (who cannot). Here, Albert is clearly the intended beneficiary of the agreement between Bart and Otto. (See Rest. 2d, Chapter 14 Introductory Note, for a history of the beneficiary concept.) Rest. 2d §302(1). An intended beneficiary has the right to sue to enforce the promisee's promise. The choices here raise the issue: which one of the parties may he sue? May he sue both? The third-party beneficiary may certainly sue the promisor, who, in this case, has received value for his promise. May he also sue the promisee? The majority view is that he may. Rest. 2d §310(1). Of course, he is entitled to one satisfaction of his claim. Rest. 2d §310(2). The best answer is therefore choice C. Albert may recover against both Bart and Otto, so long as he collects only $4,000 from either or both. Choice Ais wrong because Albert is not limited to a suit against Bart. Choice Bis wrong because he is not limited to a suit against Otto. Choice Dis wrong because the intended beneficiary may initiate a suit in his own name and does not have to wait for the promisee (Bart) to recover against the promisor (Otto).",Consideration
"<div>86.  Maples, Inc., a distributor of trees and shrubs in the Northeast, enters into a five-year contract with Viburnum Corp., a grower of shrubs, to supply Maples with all its requirements of viburnums and hollies for five years. Viburnums and hollies represent 35 percent of Maples's business and 75 percent of Viburnum's business. There is no mention in the contract of the right of either party to assign. The parties enjoy a model relationship for the first two years. In the third year, Maples receives an irresistible offer for its business and sells all its assets to Poplar Nurseries, the nation's largest distributor of plants. Among the assets assigned is the contract with Viburnum. Viburnum is concerned that Poplar's requirements will be too much for it to handle and that Poplar will be slower to pay its invoices than Maples.</div><div><br></div><div>It notifies Maples and Poplar that it will not honor the assignment and will not sell to Poplar. In its notice, it states, “We bought the credit, payment record, and requirements of Maples. We do not believe that Poplar will be able to pay our invoices on time or that we can satisfy Poplar's needs.” To satisfy its needs for viburnums and hollies, Poplar goes into the market and is unable to find another grower with the production capacity of Viburnum. Poplar sues Viburnum for damages and for specific performance. What result?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Poplar will recover damages but not an order of specific performance.","B.   Poplar will recover both damages and an order of specific performance.","C.   Viburnum will prevail because the contract is not assignable.","D.   Viburnum will prevail unless Poplar can prove that its credit is as good as Maples's and its requirements about the same.",,,2,"B  The modern view is that all contracts are assignable, except under circumstances that would make the assignment inherently unfair to the obligor, such as by increasing the burden or risk to the promisor. UCC §2-210(2) (UCC §2-210(1)(a) under the 2003 revisions of article 2). Here, Viburnum expressed two concerns: (1) that Poplar may have greater demands than Maples and (2) that Poplar may not pay as quickly as Maples. The UCC protects Viburnum from excessive demands by limiting the quantity Poplar can require to an amount reasonably proportionate to the amounts Maples demanded in the past. UCC §2-306(1). Viburnum may refuse to fill excessive demands, but may not refuse to fill demands within the range demanded by Maples. The UCC protects Viburnum from the second concern by allowing it to demand adequate assurances that Poplar will perform the contract. UCC §2-210(5) (UCC §2-210(2)(c) under the 2003 revisions to article 2). If Poplar fails to provide adequate assurance, Viburnum then may have a right to terminate the contract based on an implied repudiation by Poplar. UCC §2-609. Neither potential problem seems to justify an immediate termination of the contract. No breach by Maples or Poplar justifies that preemptive move. If specific performance prevents all of Poplar's damages, it may not receive both remedies. However, choice Bremains the best answer because some damages might occur before the court orders specific performance. Choice Ais incorrect. Even if Viburnum's performance is not unique, other appropriate circumstances may justify specific performance, including a shortage of the goods. Poplar's inability to find another supplier suggests that a shortage exists. Choice Cis plausible if the court refuses to enforce the assignment because facts essential to the original agreement are no longer applicable. Crane Ice Cream Co. v. Terminal Freezing & Heating Co. Choice Dis wrong because Poplar need not establish the similarities to prevail. Rather, the assignment will be presumed effective. Viburnum may resist excessive requirements or poor credit under the UCC, but may not reject the assignment based on unsubstantiated fears that these might arise.",Assignments

Maxwell will prevail because he accepted Sunset's offer and was forced to pay more than the special Sunset rates.","D.   Sunset will prevail because, as a former guest, Maxwell should have known that Sunset had a limited number of rooms.",,,2,"B  The best answer is choice B. The letter sent by Sunset Hotel was not an offer but an invitation to reserve its accommodations for a specific weekend. Offers by hotels, airlines, cruise ships, theatrical performances, sports events, and other similar attractions are understood by everyone to include the condition of limited availability. In this sense, they fall into the category of offers controlled by “trade usage.” Trade usage is defined in the UCC as “any practice … having such regularity in a … trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.” UCC §1-205(2). Since the hotel notified Maxwell that it was sold out (i.e., rejected his offer) and did not confirm his reservation (i.e., accept his offer), there was no contract. Choice Ais wrong because it assumes the hotel made an offer. If the hotel had made an offer, Maxwell's method of acceptance probably would be deemed reasonable, certainly more reasonable than just showing up and attempting to register and use the room! Choice Cis wrong because Sunset did not make an offer that Maxwell was empowered to accept. Choice Dis not the best answer because, although it states the facts correctly, Maxwell's knowledge would make no difference if, in fact, the hotel's letter had been an offer. The hotel can limit the offer to first come, first served, but its failure to do so would come at its own risk, not Maxwell's.","Offer and Acceptance"

Yes, because Farnsworth's telephone call was a repudiation.","B.   Yes, if Jones interpreted Farnsworth's telephone call as a repudiation.","C.   No, because Farnsworth's telephone call did not constitute a repudiation.","D.   No, because a repudiation must be in writing to be given effect.",,,3,"C  The call was not a repudiation for two reasons. First, it did not unequivocally state that Farnsworth would not perform starting February 1, but simply expressed the possibility that he would be unprepared to begin until February 10. Repudiation requires an unequivocal statement that the party will commit a breach. Rest. 2d §250(a). Second, the breach threatened was not material. Rather, Farnsworth's statement at most suggested he would miss 10 days on a 24-month (730-day) contract. While Jones would be entitled to damages for the breach, the breach is not sufficiently material to justify termination of the entire contract. Thus, no cause of action for total breach would arise, as required under Rest. 2d §250(a). Choice Ais wrong for these two reasons: The statement was equivocal, and the breach was not material. Choice Bis wrong because the only unequivocal statements count as repudiation. No matter how reasonable Jones's interpretation may have seemed, uncertainty must be resolved by recourse to a request for adequate assurances of performance, not by assuming the words in fact signal a breach when they did not clearly so state. Rest. 2d §251. (If this case arose under the 2003 revisions to article 2 of the UCC, choice Bmight be correct. That rule defines repudiation to include “language that a reasonable person would interpret to mean that the other party will not or cannot make a performance still due under the contract,” and does not expressly require that the threatened breach be material. UCC §2-610(2).) Choice Dis wrong because nothing requires that a repudiation be in writing. It may be accomplished orally or by deed.","Contract Formation"

No, because Jones was not materially prejudiced by Farnsworth's failure to appear on February 1.","D.   No, because Farnsworth notified Jones of his delay in a timely fashion.",,,3,"C  The issue presented by these facts is as follows: Did Farnsworth's failure to appear on February 1 constitute a material breach entitling Jones to cancel the contract and sue for damages? It's not always easy to decide if a breach is material. The courts resort to several tests: How much has the aggrieved party been damaged? What is the essence of the contract? Can the aggrieved party be compensated adequately? What is the relationship in value between the defaulted performance and the balance of the contract? How extensive is the delay? Was the breach willful? Can the aggrieved party make other arrangements? On these facts, it's hard to see how Farnsworth's breach can be deemed material. He had a two-year contract. His failure to appear was not willful (though evidence that he could have returned earlier but willfully remained in China might negate this). He suggested a temporary placement. He kept his promise to appear on the 10th. The best answer is therefore choice C. Jones, however, would have the right to set off against Farnsworth's salary any damages resulting from his delay in appearing. Choice Ais incorrect as a matter of law; only a material breach, not just any breach, will justify terminating the contract. Choice Bis wrong because Farnsworth's breach was not material, and Jones can be adequately compensated for his damage. Choice Dis wrong.

No, because Farnsworth was not permanently injured.","D.   No, because Farnsworth's disability established an impracticability defense.",,,4,"D  If the death or illness of a party makes performance impracticable, that party is excused, at least for the duration of the disability. Farnsworth's injuries were severe enough to relieve him of his responsibility to appear and entitle Jones to seek a replacement. However, because the contract was for two years and the period of injury was only two months, the contract was discharged only partially and could be enforced anew by either party once Farnsworth was able to sing again. Since Farnsworth's performance was excused, he is not responsible to reimburse Jones for the additional fees paid to Young. The correct answer is choice D. Choice Ais not correct. It's immaterial to the outcome whether Jones was responsible in any way. Choice Bis incorrect on the facts.

To award him these costs is to put him back in the same position as if Farnsworth had not breached. Rest. 2d §347. The correct answer ischoice B. Jones is entitled to damages for all of February because that month has passed, and to the present value of the excess costs in future months.

Terry logged on to Shelly's Web site, clicked on the goods she wanted, filled in the quantity (100), and went to the checkout screen. That screen showed the total price and asked Terry to select shipping terms. As a special that week, Shelly's site offered free standard shipping (which the Web page said would arrive in seven to ten business days via a ground delivery service). Expedited shipping would have cost at least $300 on an order this size, so Terry elected the free shipping. Terry gave credit card information for the payment and then clicked to confirm the order.

Terry will prevail because the confirmation e-mail from Shelly's Web site accepted Terry's offer in writing.",,,4,"D*  The analysis will differ depending on whether the 2003 revisions to article 2 have been enacted. In either case, however, each of Shelly's defenses should fail, leaving Terry with an enforceable contract. Choice Awould be correct if no acceptance occurred before Shelly sent the e-mail informing Terry that the goods were backordered. The electronic confirmation, however, seems to be an acceptance. Even if it will not serve as a writing, it can satisfy the requirement of assent. Choice Acould be correct if choice Cwere correct — in which case, choice Cwould be a better answer because it negates acceptance by itself, without regard to any other answer. Choice Cis incorrect because Shelly can authorize any agent she wishes to respond for her. The computer confirmed the order under program instructions she supplied (or hired another to supply). Her failure to consider each offer consciously is no defense. (Shelly would not want it to be a defense if Terry, rather than Shelly, tried to cancel the order after confirmation. Shelly probably sends e-mails only when problems arise. If so, none of her customers get a human acceptance in the normal course, which could leave Shelly without any enforceable rights.) The revisions to article 2 codify the ability of electronic agents to bind a party. UCC §2-204(4) (2003 revisions). Choice Bis incorrect under the 2003 revisions for two reasons. First, the Statute of Frauds applies to sales of $5,000 or more, but the sale here is only $2,000. Second, the statute requires a signed “record,” not a signed “writing.” UCC §2-201(1) (2003 revisions).Arecord includes “information that is inscribed on a tangible medium or that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.” UCC §2-103(1)(m) (2003 revisions). Thus, the e-mail confirmation would satisfy the Statute of Frauds if signed. The signature requirement under the UCC is quite minimal — any symbol, such as initials or a logo, may suffice. UCC §§2-103(1)(p) (2003 revisions), 1-201(39) (original), 1-201(37) (2001 revisions). As long as the e-mail confirmation includes the company name, it seems likely to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. *Choice Bpresents a much closer case under the unrevised UCC, and may in fact be a better answer. The statute required a writing, which was defined as reducing the information to tangible form. An e-mail is not a tangible form and thus not a writing.Acourt may refuse to get caught up in these niceties, recognizing that the purposes of the statute are fully satisfied by an e-mail that can be printed out. Indeed, if Shelly printed out a copy of the e-mail, that would be a writing, even if the printout was never sent to Terry.

The terms and conditions, therefore, do not change anything. The confirmation accepted the offer before any counteroffer or rejection was received by Terry. Choice A, therefore, is factually correct, but legally irrelevant. Choice Cis wrong because Terry probably is bound by the terms and conditions. Although some Web sites force users to scroll through all the terms to reach a button labeled “I agree” before they will consummate the transaction, nothing in the law requires this practice. The claim that the terms and conditions should not apply to Terry is no more persuasive than a claim that someone who signed a written agreement without reading it should be excused from the terms of the writing because of his own neglect. *Choice Bremains a plausible choice under the UCC as it exists today, but will be incorrect if states adopt the 2003 revisions to article 2.","Offer and Acceptance"
"95. Questions 93-97 are based on the following fact situation:<div>Shelly sells candles over the Internet. Terry purchased a scented candle from Shelly's Web site. The candle was so good that Terry decided to purchase a large supply, in part to avoid running out, in part to give as gifts, and in part to sell at her booth in a local farmer's market. Terry logged on to Shelly's Web site, clicked on the goods she wanted, filled in the quantity (100), and went to the checkout screen. That screen showed the total price and asked Terry to select shipping terms. As a special that week, Shelly's site offered free standard shipping (which the Web page said would arrive in seven to ten business days via a ground delivery service). Expedited shipping would have cost at least $300 on an order this size, so Terry elected the free shipping. Terry gave credit card information for the payment and then clicked to confirm the order. A final page appeared with all the information Terry had supplied (quantity, price, delivery, credit card, billing and shipping address, etc.). It asked Terry to review the page and confirm the information, and to then click a button to submit the order. Terry clicked the confirmation button without reviewing the information. The Web site gave Terry a confirmation number and e-mailed a confirmation of the receipt of her order, promising a second e-mail when it had been shipped. All of these messages were generated automatically by the Web engine running the page; no human being saw the order until the next day.</div><div><br></div><div><div>95.  Consider the general facts, but not the specific facts of the preceding two problems. Immediately after submitting the order, it dawned on Terry that there were too many zeros in the numbers just confirmed: The order was for 1,000 candles, not 100, for a price of $20,000, not $2,000. She immediately clicked “Contact Us” and e-mailed a revocation of the offer, explaining that she intended to order 100 candles, not 1,000. Just after she clicked “Send,” she heard the sound announcing incoming mail. Opening her inbox, Terry saw the confirmation of a 1,000 candle order from Shelly's Web site. Assume Terry's e-mail, sent from Shelly's Web site to Shelly's Web site, arrived immediately in Shelly's inbox, but that no one checked the e-mail until the next morning. Shelly's acceptance was dispatched almost immediately after Terry submitted the order, but Terry's computer checked for e-mail only every 20 minutes, so the confirmation probably was dispatched before Terry sent the e-mail canceling the order (as the time stamps on the messages confirm), even though it arrived after Terry sent the e-mail. If Shelly has enough candles and wants to enforce Terry's order, what is the likely result?</div></div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Shelly will prevail because the acceptance was dispatched before the revocation was dispatched.","B.   Terry will prevail because the revocation was received before the acceptance was received.","C.   Shelly will prevail because the acceptance was dispatched before the revocation was received.","D.   Terry will prevail because the revocation was dispatched before the acceptance was received.",,,3,"C  The mailbox rule applies to e-mail.A revocation is effective on receipt at a place the other party designated for its delivery. Thus, Terry's revocation was effective the moment Shelly received the e-mail — which the question says is the same moment she sent the e-mail. But an acceptance is effective from the time it is dispatched. Because Shelly's Web site dispatched the acceptance before Terry's revocation was received, the contract was formed at that moment. Choice Ais incorrect as a statement of law because the important time for revocation is the time of receipt, not the time of dispatch. Because dispatch and receipt were simultaneous, it describes the facts well enough, but is not as good as choice C, which accurately states the rule. Choice Bwould be correct if the mailbox rule did not apply. Even though no one read the message until morning, it was received when it arrived in Shelly's inbox — the place designated for such communications. Rest. 2d §68. Without the mailbox rule, all communications are effective on receipt. The rule, however, is not limited to snail mail, but makes any acceptance effective once it leaves the offeree's possession. Rest. 2d §63. Choice Dis factually accurate but irrelevant under the legal rule.","Contract Formation"

The contract is not enforceable for lack of a writing.","B.   The contract should be rescinded for unilateral mistake.","C.   The contract should be reformed for mistake of integration.","D.   The contract is unconscionable.",,,1,"A*  The Statute of Frauds is Terry's best hope (until and unless the 2003 revisions to the UCC become law). Terry's order and e-mail are both electronic, not in tangible form. They do not satisfy the requirement of writing under the existing law. While a court may decide to treat them as writings anyway because they serve most of the same functions, a court that scrupulously follows the language of the UCC will not enforce the contract against Terry. *Choice Bis a plausible answer and would be a better answer if the 2003 revisions to article 2 become law. Once courts recognize an electronic record as sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, Terry's reliance on the Statute of Frauds will fail. Unilateral mistake is hard to apply to these facts, but might work. The quantity was a basic assumption; it has a material effect on the exchange (Terry would need to pay ten times the price expected, though Terry would also receive ten times as much in return). The risk of mistake is not allocated to Terry by the agreement — though a review of the unread terms and conditions would be required to confirm this. Conscious ignorance might allocate the risk to Terry: Terry knew she had not reviewed the final confirmation carefully but submitted the order anyway. But perhaps this was mere negligence on Terry's part, not conscious ignorance. Finally, the deal may have been too good to be true, putting Shelly on notice that Terry was mistaken. This may depend on how often Shelly gets other orders of this size. Choice Cis incorrect because reformation corrects a writing to reflect the agreement the parties actually made, not the agreement one of them wished she had made. This is not a case where the parties agreed on 100, but the writing erroneously said 1,000. Shelly agreed to sell 1,000 candles, the only number in the record at the time Shelly accepted. Unilateral mistake justifies reformation when the other party commits fraud or nondisclosure. No such misconduct applies to Shelly here. While canceling the order might be plausible, reforming it to 100 would be unusual. Choice Dis incorrect. Nothing in the facts suggests that the deal is unfair; the candles seem to be worth the price, and free shipping on an order this large makes the deal even better. The terms were not concealed from Terry. In fact, the terms to which Terry objects were terms typed in by Terry, not terms Shelly imposed on Terry. No basis for unconscionability exists.","Contract Formation"

Shelly bills Terry's credit card and ships 1,000 candles. Shelly was busy and decided to ship the order in ten boxes, each containing 100 candles, sent over a period of several days. (This allowed Shelly to do other work, instead of focusing on Terry's order exclusively for an extended period.) Terry received the first box of 100 candles eight business days after the order was placed and accepted delivery. On the ninth business day, one more box arrived. Terry accepted the box, but e-mailed Shelly for instructions on how to return the double shipment. On the tenth business day, no boxes arrived, but Shelly's reply e-mail alerted Terry, for the first time, to the mistake in the order. On the eleventh business day, the other eight boxes arrived. Terry rejected the boxes. If Terry claims that late delivery justifies rejection of the candles, will Terry prevail?</div></div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, Terry can reject the eight late boxes because late delivery is a defect within the perfect tender rule, but must keep the two boxes already accepted.","B.   Yes, Terry can reject all ten boxes because late delivery is a defect within the perfect tender rule and allows rejection of the entire shipment, not just the portion that was late.","C.   No, because this was an installment contract and the one-day delay did not substantially impair the value of either this shipment or the entire contract.","D.   No, because the goods delivered were not defective in any way, just late.",,,2,"B  Under the perfect tender rule, any defect in delivery permits the buyer to reject the whole, accept the whole, or reject any commercial unit and reject the rest. UCC §2-601. The failure to deliver 1,000 candles within ten business days fails to conform to the contract, permitting Terry to resort to this section. Choice Ais incorrect in that it implies Terry can reject only the portion that was late. Even though Terry accepted the first two boxes, that happened before the breach occurred (i.e., before any right to reject arose). The breach creates a right that Terry can exercise as to the whole shipment (or only the nine boxes Terry didn't intend to order) at Terry's option. Choice Cis a correct statement of the law, but does not apply to this case. Terry did not order candles to be shipped in installments (say, 100 per month). Terry placed a single order for 1,000 candles, all due at the same time. Shelly's decision, for her own convenience, to ship the ten boxes at different times does not convert a single order into an installment contract. If shipment in a single lot (not a single box, but one lot with all ten boxes) was constrained by external factors, not just Shelly's own convenience, Shelly might argue that these circumstances authorized shipment in lots. UCC §2-307. If so, this would be an installment contract as defined in UCC §2-612(1) and choice Cwould be correct. Choice Dis incorrect because the perfect tender rule applies to any failure to conform to the contract, not just defects in the goods themselves. (Note: If Shelly could argue that the contract did not require delivery within seven to ten business days, she might prevail on the ground that no breach occurred. The estimate of delivery might not be deemed a promise. The default UCC term would fix delivery when Shelly put the boxes in the hands of the carrier. UCC §2-308(a). In this case, choice D, though not phrased with this position in mind, would be the best answer. Because the parties' negotiations mentioned the delivery time, it seems likely this became an express term, overriding the UCC's default term.)",Remedies
"<div>98.  Sean, a wholesale food salesman, phoned Compco to order a laptop computer. Compco's sales agent discussed the configuration Sean wanted and quoted a price, including the special discounts available that week. Sean agreed to that price. Compco took Sean's credit card information and said the computer would arrive in five business days. Compco billed Sean's credit card when it shipped the computer. When the computer arrived (on time), Sean opened the box and began setting up the machine, discarding various papers that were inside the box. Among these papers was one labeled “Terms of Sale.” This paper said that all sales were subject to the terms on that page. The lengthy terms included provisions limiting Sean's remedy for breach of warranty to repair or replacement, at Compco's option, and excluding any consequential damages that result from breach. The Terms of Sale also specified that if the buyer was unwilling to be bound by these terms, it should return the computer to Compco within 30 days for a full refund, including shipping both ways. Sean kept the computer more than 30 days. Sean then went on a business trip with the laptop, but was unable to use the wireless connections anyplace. Ultimately, Compco determined that the integrated wireless function was defective and replaced the laptop with one that worked. In the meantime, Sean lost considerable time trying to make the wireless work and can point to at least two business opportunities lost as a result of the defective wireless. Under the UCC, if Sean seeks damages against Compco, will the limited remedies in Compco's Terms of Sale be enforceable against Sean?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   No, the Terms of Sale, though accepted by Sean, never became part of the contract because the modification lacked consideration.","B.   Yes, the Terms of Sale were a counteroffer, which Sean accepted by keeping the computer instead of returning it within 30 days.","C.   Yes, the Terms of Sale were proposals to modify the contract, which Sean accepted by keeping the computer instead of returning it within 30 days.","D.   No, the Terms of Sale were proposals to modify the contract, which Sean never accepted.",,,4,"D*  The contract formed on the phone — computer for price — was complete in itself. Both parties performed it: Sean paid, and Compco shipped the goods. Subsequent negotiations could modify it, but neither party can be compelled to accept different terms if they prefer to retain the terms of the original contract. Compco's record included with the computer was not part of the terms mentioned on the phone, but proposed additional or different terms. (Compco could have demanded these terms if the salesperson had noted, before the agreement was final, that all sales were subject to terms and conditions contained in the box. Sean could not accept an offer without those terms if Compco's offer included those terms, at least by reference.) Because Sean is not a merchant of computers, proposals to modify the contract will not be accepted by silence, but require express assent. UCC §2-207(2) (deleted in the 2003 revisions of article 2). The same result would be reached under revised UCC §2-207. The new terms were not part of the records of both parties nor part of the default provisions under the code. Unless assent by Sean was found, they would not become part of the transaction. Choice Ais incorrect because modification under the UCC does not require consideration if made in good faith. UCC §2-209. Sean might question good faith here: Nothing changed after the phone call to make the new terms more important than before. Sean should have more success challenging the acceptance of the modified terms. *Choice Bis incorrect because the phone conversation between the parties stated a complete agreement. There would be no basis for either party to challenge the enforceability of the terms reached at that time. Nonetheless, at least one prominent court has concluded that sales of this type are not final during the phone conversation, even though payment occurs at that time. Rather, the offer consists of shipping the goods, which the consumer has an option to accept after reviewing the terms in the box. Keeping the goods then signals acceptance. See Hill v. Gateway 2000. So far, other courts have not adopted this reasoning. Choice Cis wrong because Sean's conduct is ambiguous. Keeping the computer could express assent, if Sean so intended. Rest. 2d §69(1)(b). But silence also could express rejection of the modification and a decision to keep the computer under the terms of the original contract. Compco cannot force Sean to relinquish the original contract right (to keep the computer) as the only way to reject the modification.","Contract Formation"
"<div>99.  On the facts of the preceding problem, if the Terms of Sale do not limit Sean's remedy, is Sean likely to recover consequential damages for the lost sales?</div>",multiple-choice,"A.   Yes, because a computer seller should foresee business use of a laptop will occur in the ordinary course of events.","B.   Yes, but only if Sean informed Compco while ordering the computer of his needs, including the need for wireless access for business purposes.","C.   No, because the lost sales were easily avoided by buying a dial-up cord and accessing the Internet that way.","D.   No, because the losses were not foreseeable by Compco at the time of contract formation, even if they were fully aware of Sean's business uses.",,,2,"B  The UCC permits recovery of “any loss resulting from the general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.” UCC §2-715(2)(a). If Sean made known his requirements for the computer, including the need for wireless access, then losses resulting from seller's failure to meet these needs seem to fall within the definition. Choice Ais incorrect. Not all (nor perhaps most) laptop buyers use them for business, especially in a way that would produce losses if wireless access were interrupted for a few days. Just because some do does not mean that Compco should foresee these losses without notice. Such a general foreseeability requirement would virtually eliminate this restriction on consequential damages. Choice Cis incorrect, or at best depends on facts not in the question. Dial-up may not fully substitute for wireless access. It requires a phone line, which might not always be available while traveling. It also is significantly slower than wireless, which may make it less effective. Although dial-up might have avoided these losses, that is not certain on these facts. Choice Dis incorrect. Notice to the seller would lay the groundwork for consequential damages, as long as the notice was sufficiently detailed. The precise nature of what Sean would need to reveal may be subject to some debate: is it enough that Compco know Sean conducts transactions via computer, or would Sean need to reveal specific deals and the amount of potential losses in each to give sufficient notice? But, at some point, full disclosure would satisfy the requirements of the UCC.",Remedies
